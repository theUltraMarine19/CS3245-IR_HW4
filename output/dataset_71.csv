     REGINA v STEVEN JIONE 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
      
     
     
      
    1 HODGSON JA: I agree with Grove J. 
     
      
    2 GROVE J: This is a Crown appeal asserting the manifest inadequacy of a sentence imposed on the Respondent by Ashford DCJ at Campbelltown District Court. The Respondent pleaded guilty to a single count of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent so to do contrary to s 33 of the Crimes Act 1900. The maximum prescribed penalty for this offence is imprisonment for twenty five years. A standard non-parole period of seven years is scheduled in the table within Part 4 Division 1A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. Her Honour sentenced the Respondent to imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of five years and a balance term of three years.  
     
      
    3 The following summary of the facts is taken from a written submission by the Crown which Senior Counsel for the Respondent acknowledged that his client “generally” accepted. There was no identification of any detail within it which was not accepted:  
     
      
       
        
        “..on the evening of 7 July 2005 the respondent and the victim, Colin McIntosh, were drinking separately at the Ingleburn Hotel. At a time between about 11.30 pm and 12.30 am the respondent and the victim were observed arguing. A witness saw the respondent push the victim before punching him a number of times in the head. The victim fell to the ground and did not move. The witness tried to calm the respondent down and the respondent walked back into another area of the hotel. 
        
       
       
        
        At about 12.30am another witness observed a scuffle taking place in the hotel car park. The witness saw the respondent standing over the victim, punching him in the head and kicking his body. The victim did not retaliate. After the assault the victim got to his feet, stumbled and walked away. As he did so the respondent taunted him and yelled in his direction. The respondent walked over to where the victim was standing and punched him. The witness saw the victim on the ground with the respondent kneeling over him. The respondent punched the victim about eight times to the facial area. 
        
       
       
        
        The witness, a female, attempted to assist the victim by grabbing the respondent’s shoulder. As the respondent moved his arm back to strike the victim again his elbow hit the witness in the cheek. The respondent then punched the victim in the head at least three more times. The witness yelled at the respondent in an attempt to prevent him further striking the victim. At the urging of the witness, some bystanders intervened and grabbed the respondent and dragged him away. The witness helped the victim to his feet. She asked the victim if he was all right and he replied, “Yeah” and started walking away. 
        
       
       
        
        The respondent was taken back inside the hotel and the victim was seen walking away from the hotel. 
        
       
       
        
        The female witness left the hotel a short time later with some friends. As the group approached the corner of Nardoo and Oxford Streets they saw the victim lying on the ground. He was in a distressed and unconscious state, not moving and gasping for air. An ambulance was called and the victim was taken to Liverpool Hospital. 
        
       
       
        
        The respondent had been observed following the victim and when police arrived witnesses directed them to the Ingleburn Railway Station where they arrested the respondent. 
        
       
       
        
        On admission to hospital the victim was assessed as being 3 on the Glasgow coma scale. The treating doctor observed a left parietal subgaleal haematoma and shoe sole imprints on both sides of the victim’s face. A CT scan revealed a significant and acute subdural haematoma and the victim required an immediate craniectomy to relieve pressure on his brain. After spending an extensive period in the Intensive Care Unit on life support, the victim was moved to the Brain Injury Unit. 
        
       
       
        
        The report of Dr Hodgkinson dated 21 August 2006 (part of Exhibit A) indicated that on discharge from the Brain Injury Rehabilitation Unit the victim remained severely impaired. He required total nursing care. He was incontinent of urine and faeces. His nutritional requirements were being met by intragastric feeds although he was capable of small amounts of oral modified diet and thickened fluids. Dr Hodgkinson indicated that the victim remained fully dependent in mobility and personal care. Further improvement in level of care is unlikely. His level of communication was severely impaired. He is likely to require full time nursing care indefinitely. He is unlikely to ever regain the ability to reach a normal level of communication ability and certainly would be incapable of employment in any capacity. 
        
       
       
        
        In summary the victim, a father of three, has been diagnosed as suffering comprehensive brain damage. He is able to breathe unassisted but remains attached to a feeding tube. He is expected to remain in a vegetative state indefinitely. His prognosis is poor and he is likely to be totally reliant on nursing home care for the remainder of his life. He has a significantly reduced life expectancy.” 
        
       
      
    4 The Respondent was born in Fiji on 6 September 1981. He came to Australia with his mother at the age of sixteen and undertook a further year (Year 11) of secondary education. He commenced, but did not complete, an apprenticeship as a mechanic and at the time of the offence had been working for about three months as a furniture removalist. He had a poor relationship with his mother and, following her marriage, also with his stepfather. He has never met his biological father. He left home at about the age of twenty two or twenty three when he commenced a de facto relationship, of which a child has been born. 
     
      
    5 In 2004 his partner took out an apprehended domestic violence order against him, but in January 2005 at Campbelltown Local Court he was convicted of contravening that order, assault (of that partner) and maliciously damaging property. For the lastmentioned he was fined $500 and for the other two offences he was placed on a bond, with conditions, to be of good behaviour for twelve months. The bond was current when the subject offence was committed in July 2005. He has no other convictions. 
     
      
    6 A report by Mr Taylor, a psychologist, was before the sentencing court. The history which the Respondent gave described starting to drink alcohol when aged fourteen years, heavy drinking by the time eighteen years had been attained and being intoxicated “from Wednesday night to Saturday night”, a pattern maintained until his arrest. He used cocaine from the age of nineteen every weekend if he could afford it. He partook of ecstasy for about twelve months until he was hospitalized with a liver problem. At aged twenty two he had begun to use “ice” (an amphetamine) and a liquid form of it known as “base”.  
     
      
    7 The Respondent gave evidence at the sentencing proceedings and testified that he had consumed “base” on the night of the offence as well as a quantity of beer. He was seen to be consuming VB stubbies and he admitted drinking eight to nine “beers”. When arrested he was unsteady on his feet and smelled of alcohol. Her Honour referred to evidence in reports of Dr Perl and Professor Starmer concerning the likely effects of his ingestions but she expressed no particular finding. She observed that the Respondent considered himself moderately affected by these substances.  
     
      
    8 The Crown complaint is that her Honour erred in assessing the offence as falling within the mid range of objective seriousness of such an offence. Her Honour’s remarks on sentence expressed that conclusion in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “On looking to the objective range of seriousness of this offence I find it to be in the mid range noting the action to be spontaneous with no degree of planning involved.” 
        
       
      
    9 At the outset of her remarks, her Honour had observed, without further comment, that “the maximum sentence for the offence is twenty five years imprisonment”. 
     
      
    10 The reference to “mid range” had an apparent relationship to her preceding statement: 
     
      
       
        
        “The standard non parole period is seven years and in the light of his plea of guilty I use this as a bench mark in sentencing him.” 
        
       
      
    11 As above stated, the prescription of standard non-parole period is to be found in Part 4 Division 1A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. Section 54A (2) provides that the standard non-parole period represents the non-parole period for an offence in the middle of the range of seriousness for the particular offence. Section 54B (4) obliges the giving of reasons for increasing or reducing the standard non-parole period. Her Honour reduced the standard non-parole period but did not express reasons, however, s 54B (5) preserves the validity of sentence where there has been such an omission. 
     
      
    12 It has been established that the standard non-parole period should be understood as having been specified for mid range offences where there has been conviction after trial: R v Way (2004) 60 NSWLR 168, but the prescription continues to provide a benchmark for sentencing when there has been a guilty plea. But it is not a sole benchmark and there is nothing in Part 4 Division 1A to suggest that the statutory maximum ceases to provide a reference for sentence assessment. That maximum reveals a policy of the Legislature relevant to penalty for particular offence: Gibson v The Queen (1991) 172 CLR 353 at p 364 and has been described as a reflection of public perception of seriousness: R v H [1980] 3 A Crim R 53 at p 65. 
     
      
    13 The enquiry as to where an offence lies in the range needs to take into account the actus reus, the consequences of the conduct and any factors which might properly be said to have impinged on the mens rea of an offender: Way at p 186. 
     
      
    14 Although her Honour referred to the consequence of “catastrophic injury” to the victim, an assessment that the offence should be categorized in the mid range is manifestly wrong. In the recounting of facts it can be observed that the actus reus emerged from more than one attack on the victim despite attempts by bystanders to restrain the Respondent. It is submitted on his behalf that he was not shown to have “stomped” on the victim but it is difficult to accept that contention in the light of the shoe marks detected by medical attendants on his face.  
     
      
    15 The Crown submission that the injuries suffered by the victim were as serious as they could be suffered by anyone short of death has a compelling force. This offence was well above the category of mid range and in the category of high seriousness.  
     
      
    16 Although her Honour had acknowledged the maximum penalty prescribed, the content of her remarks reveals a focus upon the standard non-parole period as a “benchmark” without further reference to the other important benchmark of that prescribed maximum. I am unpersuaded that it is shown that this is an appropriate occasion for the exercise of the residual discretion of this Court to dismiss a Crown appeal against a manifestly inadequate sentence. The appeal should be allowed and the sentence quashed and this Court should proceed to resentence. 
     
      
    17 Earlier reference has been made to subjective matters concerning the Respondent. An affidavit sworn by him expresses his contrition and remorse and I see no reason not to accept his expressions. The affidavit also reveals the steps which have been taken by the Respondent to address his drug and alcohol problems as well as anger management. The outlook appears positive and includes recognition of the need for, and a desire for, rehabilitation.  
     
      
    18 Although the matter had been listed to confirm a trial date in the District Court when the Respondent asked to be arraigned and offered the plea of guilty, her Honour found that the plea was offered at the earliest opportunity. That would appear to be incorrect. She found that the plea should attract a discount of 25 percent. I would, despite the apparent error, reapply that finding. I would also vary the relationship between non-parole period and balance term in favour of the Respondent for the reasons which her Honour expressed, in particular, the need for ongoing rehabilitation and the vulnerability of the Respondent which arises from his background and upbringing.  
     
      
    19 I formally record the reason for departing from the standard non-parole period as the assessment that the offence lies above the middle of the range of seriousness for such offences. 
     
      
    20 Excluding the discount for the plea of guilty, I would assess an appropriate sentence for this offence, taking into account objective and subjective factors, at sixteen years imprisonment. Applying the discount for the plea of guilty the term should be calculated as twelve years imprisonment. That result gives appropriate weight to the recognized practice of exercising restraint when sentencing after a successful Crown appeal. 
     
      
    21 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      1. Crown appeal against sentence allowed. 
       
      2. Sentence imposed in the District Court quashed. 
       
      3. In lieu thereof the Respondent be sentenced to imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of eight years commencing on 8 July 2005 and expiring on 7 July 2013 with a balance term of four years commencing on 8 July 2013. 
       
      4. The earliest date of eligibility for parole specified as 7 July 2013. 
       
      
    22 SIMPSON J: I agree with Grove J.

    1 HODGSON JA: I agree with Simpson J. 
     
      
    2 GROVE J: I agree with Simpson J. 
     
      
    3 SIMPSON J: On 28 June 2006, in the Wagga Wagga Local Court, the applicant entered a plea of guilty to a single count of aggravated break enter and steal (the circumstance of aggravation being that the applicant was in company) committed on 31 March 2006. He asked that a further offence of break enter and steal, committed on 12 March 2006, on a Form 1, be taken into account pursuant to the provisions of Pt 3, Div 3 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (“the Sentencing Procedure Act”). The offence to which the applicant pleaded guilty was brought under s 112(2) of the Crimes Act 1900, which prescribes a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 20 years. By Pt 4, Div 1A of the Sentencing Procedure Act, a standard non-parole period of imprisonment for 5 years is prescribed for the offence. 
     
      
    4 On 29 September 2006 Judge Puckeridge QC sentenced the applicant to a total term of imprisonment for 2 years and 3 months, made up of a non-parole period of 15 months, with a balance of term of 12 months. The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the asserted severity of this sentence.  
     
      
    5 Both offences were similar in nature. The offence the subject of the charge was committed at approximately 3.00am on 31 March 2006. The applicant, in company with two juveniles, entered residential premises via a closed but unlocked roller garage door. A woman and her two children were asleep inside the premises. Her husband was absent on a fishing trip. 
     
      
    6 The offenders entered the body of the house via an internal door from the garage. Together with the two juvenile co-offenders, he ransacked a number of rooms removing various items of computer equipment, handbags, and other property. He entered the bedroom of a teenage daughter. The daughter awoke but, fearing for her safety, pretended to be asleep. 
     
      
    7 The offenders were observed by a neighbour who detained one of the juveniles. Another neighbour attempted to apprehend the applicant but he pushed her away and made his escape. The other juvenile was arrested on 6 April 2006. The applicant was arrested on 12 April 2006. When interviewed he made full admissions and expressed remorse for his conduct. He and one of the juveniles assisted police to recover a large proportion of the property stolen. 
     
      
    8 The offence the subject of the Form 1 was of a similar kind except that it was committed by the applicant alone. At some time between 12 midnight and 8.30am on 12 March 2006 the applicant entered a closed but unlocked garage roller door and entered the garage. He removed a pair of golf shoes and two golf clubs before leaving. One of the golf clubs was recovered on the day of the applicant’s arrest. 
     
      
    9 Following his arrest the applicant was granted bail, subject to conditions. One of the conditions (a “curfew” condition) was that he not absent himself from his residence between the hours of 8.00pm and 6.00am unless in the company of an acceptable adult. On 29 May the curfew was varied to permit the applicant to be absent from his home if an inpatient at O’Connor House or any other residential rehabilitation programme.  
     
      
       
      Subjective circumstances 
       
      
    10 The sentencing hearing took place on 15 September 2006. A good deal of documentary evidence was put before the sentencing judge. It revealed the following. 
     
      
    11 The applicant was born on 6 August 1987. He was therefore 18½ years of age at the time of each offence. He had a criminal record which included two separate offences of being carried in a conveyance taken without consent, in respect of each of which he was subjected to a bond (in August 2003 and January 2005); an offence of break enter and steal in respect of which he was, in February 2004, again subjected to a 12 month bond; and with two offences in Queensland, of committing a public nuisance (in respect of which no conviction was recorded but a recognisance imposed) and unlawful possession of a motor vehicle (again, in respect of which no conviction was recorded, but a fine of $200 imposed). The bond which had been imposed in the Bidura Children’s Court in January 2005 in relation to the second count of being carried in a conveyance taken without consent was current at the time of each of the present offences. 
     
      
    12 The subjective case made on behalf of the applicant had some unusual, and often compelling, features. He is of Aboriginal descent. His mother wrote a lengthy letter, in which she accepted responsibility for the applicant’s difficulties. She condemned her own mothering skills (or lack thereof). She said that she had, 10 years earlier, been diagnosed as suffering a bipolar and personality disorder but that she only acknowledged the diagnosis and accepted treatment five years prior to the date on which she wrote the letter (September 2006). She said that from a very young age the applicant had suffered because of her illness and that he had witnessed domestic violence by her; that she was consuming alcohol heavily; that she took the applicant and his sister to a women’s refuge where the children were classified as “children at risk” and removed from her care. 
     
      
    13 The applicant had experienced many moves, including changes of schooling. His mother was subsequently diagnosed as suffering from breast cancer and was forced to leave the children with her boyfriend who neglected them. She continued to be a heavy consumer of alcohol. 
     
      
    14 There was much more, but what I have written is sufficient to give the flavour of the applicant’s childhood and adolescence. What his mother said was substantiated by correspondence from other relatives and acquaintances.  
     
      
    15 There was other evidence in the sentencing proceedings. The manager of the Orana Haven Aboriginal Corporation confirmed that the applicant had been a resident at that organisation’s drug and alcohol rehabilitation centre from 2 July 2006 for 9½ weeks. He reported favourably, saying that the applicant participated in all aspects of the programme, which he did not complete because of his commitment to attend the sentencing proceedings in the District Court in Wagga Wagga. Prior to taking up residence in Orana House, the applicant had spent a period of time – about three weeks – in another residential detoxification facility, O’Connor House in Wagga Wagga.  
     
      
    16 There was also a pre-sentence report, in which it was said that the applicant recognised that he had lost control of his alcohol consumption and was taking appropriate steps with respect to this by his attendance at the detoxification programme at O’Connor House, and at Orana Haven. Although brief, the report also tended to support the description given by the applicant’s mother of his circumstances. 
     
      
    17 The applicant himself gave evidence. He said that he suffered from anxiety but had consulted medical practitioners who had prescribed some medication. He had spent a period of time in a Rozelle “mental institution”. 
     
      
    18 At the conclusion of the evidence and after hearing submissions, the judge decided to stand the matter over for determination of sentence on 29 September. He made it clear that he was contemplating a further lengthy period of adjournment as permitted by s 11 of the Sentencing Procedure Act. He also considered the possibility of a sentence of a length that might be suspended. The purpose of taking the former course is to enable an offender to demonstrate rehabilitation, and the capacity to live a law-abiding life. Such a course has in it a degree of leniency, but also gives an offender an opportunity (and at the same time imposes upon him an onus) by his own behaviour to justify leniency. A sentence that is suspended has a similar effect. His Honour reminded the applicant of his bail conditions. 
     
      
    19 On resumption, however, it was brought to the judge’s attention that the applicant had, in a serious way, breached his bail conditions. On 17 September he was apprehended, during the “curfew” hours, away from home; worse, he was a passenger in a stolen vehicle. The vehicle was, in fact, involved in an accident, and the applicant spent some time in hospital. He was arrested on 26 September 2006, and appeared at court in custody on the day fixed for sentencing. 
     
      
       
      The remarks on sentence 
       
      
    20 The sentencing judge recounted the facts of the offences, and the subjective material provided to him. It is clear that he was moved by the letter from the applicant’s mother. He said that he had given serious consideration to dealing with the applicant pursuant to s 11 of the Sentencing Procedure Act, which permits a court, in appropriate circumstances, to defer sentencing for a period of up to 12 months in order to facilitate rehabilitation. Until 29 September the evidence had plainly satisfied the judge that the applicant had real prospects of achieving rehabilitation.  
     
      
    21 Judge Puckeridge was unimpressed by the most recent turn of events. In sentencing the applicant he repeated that he had intended to give consideration to using the provisions of s 11 of the Sentencing Procedure Act but said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The offender has shown that he cannot even abide by the conditions of bail for a very short period of time after they were imposed.” 
        
       
       
      He thus determined that the applicant would not be given the benefit of s 11. 
       
      
    22 He found special circumstances, pursuant to s 44(2) of the Sentencing Procedure Act, justifying departure from the statutory ratio between the head sentence and the non-parole period there stated, and proceeded to impose the sentence I have already outlined. He also departed, for the obvious reason of the applicant’s plea of guilty, and possibly by reason of his rehabilitative efforts, from the standard non-parole period. 
     
      
       
      The grounds of the application 
       
      
    23 Three grounds of the application were pleaded. They are: 
     
      
       
        
        “1. His Honour erred in failing to have proper regard in fixing sentence to the fact that the applicant had spent about three months in full time residential rehabilitation prior to be sentenced. 
         
         
        2. The learned sentencing judge erred in failing to have appropriate regard to the order imposed on the co-offender (ML) 
         
         
        3. The learned sentencing judge fell into error in his assessment of the relevant facts to be taken into account insofar as he stated in his Remarks on Sentence: 
         
         
          
          ‘ 
          The offender has shown that he cannot even abide by the conditions of bail for a very short period of time after they were imposed 
          ’.” 
          
         
        
       
       
      Ground 1: pre-sentence residential rehabilitation 
       
      
    24 There is no explicit reference in the Remarks on Sentence to the periods spent by the applicant at the Orana Haven and at O’Connor House. That is a period of about 12 weeks. The Crown conceded that, where appropriate, a sentencing judge may take into account a period of pre-sentence residential rehabilitation. The extent to which that may be done depends on a number of factors, including the rigour with which the programme is administered, and the extent to which the participant’s freedom is restricted thereby. There was little evidence, other than the letter from the Orana House manager, to demonstrate the demands made upon the applicant by these programmes. However that letter permits an inference that the Orana House programme was relatively demanding and rigorous. It is also not to be overlooked that the applicant left only because of his court hearing: he did not abandon the programme voluntarily. 
     
      
    25 It was proposed on behalf of the applicant that it was “incumbent” upon the sentencing judge to reduce the sentence imposed by up to 75 percent of that time in recognition of the circumstances of the residential rehabilitation – in other words, that the applicant’s sentence ought to have been reduced by 75 percent of three months, or about 67-68 days. 
     
      
    26 I have come to the view that the absence of any mention of what amounts (at least) to semi-custody suggests that it was overlooked. I would not accept the figure of 75 percent as an appropriate reduction, nor do I accept that an allowance for pre-sentence rehabilitation ought always to be mathematically quantified. However, I do accept that it ought to have been, and was not, recognised in the sentencing decision.  
     
      
       
      Ground 2: parity 
       
      
    27 Attention was drawn to the apparent disparity in sentencing with respect to one only of the co-offenders, ML. Both co-offenders were juveniles, and were dealt with in the Children’s Court. ML, who had some criminal history, and who was about 2 years and 4 months younger than the applicant, was released on probation for a period of 12 months. 
     
      
    28 The co-offender, FW, was, this Court was told, dealt with by way of “case conference”. He was 17 years of age at the time of the offence. There is no evidence that he had previously contravened the criminal law. 
     
      
    29 It was submitted that there is “a significant disproportionality” between the sentence imposed upon the applicant, and that imposed upon ML. There is authority that, in considering questions of parity, this Court is, in appropriate circumstances, entitled to take into account sentences or other determinations of the Children’s Court: R v Tran [2005] NSWCCA 35; R v Govinden [1999] NSWCCA 118; 106 A Crim R 314; R v Colgan [1999] NSWCCA 292. 
     
      
    30 Given that the applicant was 18½ years of age at the time of the offence charged, he had only recently reached the age at which he would be dealt with in an adult court. 
     
      
    31 Sensibly, it was not argued that the applicant ought to have been dealt with by way of a non-custodial sentence; rather, the argument was put that the sentence ought to have been moderated in order to achieve some semblance of balance with the sentence imposed upon ML. 
     
      
    32 I would accept that, given the applicant’s relative youth and recent entry into adulthood, with its exposure of him to adult criminal courts, it was relevant to take into account the manner in which ML (and, indeed FW) was dealt with. This is not to accept a true parity argument, resulting in a conclusion that the applicant ought to have been, like ML, dealt with by way of a bond (and no such argument was put); but that the leniency shown to ML had a bearing on the final sentencing determination relative to the applicant. It was not taken into account. 
     
      
       
      Ground 3: the applicant’s breach of bail conditions 
       
      
    33 While it was accepted that the applicant’s breach of bail conditions and arrest on 17 September was a relevant fact to be taken into account by the sentencing judge, it was argued that the manner in which this was done was “erroneous and unfair”. This was, as I understand it, because there was no evidence that the applicant had, on any other occasion, breached the curfew condition. Accordingly, it was argued that the seriousness of the breach was overstated. It was not right to say that he could not abide by his bail conditions even for a very short period after they were imposed. 
     
      
    34 While it may be accepted that the applicant had been subjected to the curfew condition from 12 April – about 5 months earlier – and that there was no evidence of any other breaches, the fact is that his breach occurred virtually on the eve of sentencing, and following sentencing hearings, in which the terms of the bail conditions had been brought home to the applicant. Moreover, the breach was not merely a breach of the curfew condition, the applicant was travelling in a stolen vehicle. His conduct deserved strong condemnation. 
     
      
    35 The course the sentencing judge was contemplating – a lengthy remand to enable the applicant to demonstrate rehabilitation – was thus circumvented by the applicant’s own conduct. If the applicant were unable to adhere to his bail conditions at the crucial period immediately before sentencing, then there was good reason for the judge to lack confidence that he would adhere to those conditions after the pressure of imminent sentencing was lifted. The argument was not that the judge ought to have followed either of the courses he had earlier been contemplating. Realistically, counsel tacitly accepted that the applicant had forfeited that opportunity. Rather, the argument was that the judge, having decided not to follow the s 11 path, allowed the applicant’s foolish behaviour to influence too greatly the sentence eventually imposed, and that this could be seen from the remark quoted in the pleaded ground. I would reject this ground of the application. The applicant’s conduct did deserve condemnation, and condemnation expressed as strongly as it was. 
     
      
    36 Overall, I am satisfied that the failure to take into account the period of pre-sentence rehabilitation, and the failure to take into account the manner in which ML was dealt with in the Children’s Court establish error in the sentencing process. 
     
      
    37 The error calls for a reduction in the non-parole period. I would not interfere with the overall terms of the sentence imposed. (This produces a considerable variation on the s 44(2) ratio.) I propose that leave to appeal be granted, the sentence be quashed, and in lieu thereof the applicant be sentenced to imprisonment with a non-parole period of twelve months, commencing on 16 September 2006 and expiring on 15 September 2007, with a balance of term of one year and three months, expiring on 15 December 2008. The applicant is to be released on parole at the expiration of the non-parole period, 15 September 2007.

      These proceedings are subject to the limitations upon publication and/ or broadcasting imposed by section 11 (1) of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 
      
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with Hislop J. 
     
      
    2 HULME J: I have the advantage of reading the Reasons for Judgment and orders proposed by Hislop J. I agree with the orders proposed and with his Honour’s reasons save and except for that part entitled “Significant Administrative Miscarriage”. On that topic, I prefer to express my own views. 
     
      
    3 The Applicant claims that he is effectively being deprived of much or all of the period on parole he could reasonably expect to receive under sentences the effect of which was a full term of 7 years of which only 5 years and 3 months was a non-parole period because of a policy or practice of the Parole Authority. In that connection he deposes to having “been informed by the officers of Corrective Services that it is likely that I will have to serve the total sentence of 7 years as I will be ineligible to do the course which they consider relevant to my offending behaviour as I deny the offence”. His affidavit in this regard was responded to by one from an officer of the Department who annexed a report which included the following:-  
     
      
       
        
        “The Sex Offenders Programs in the Department of Corrective Services work on the principle that the inmate is guilty of the offence/s to which he has been incarcerated. All appropriate inmates are encouraged to fill out the application form for the Sex Offenders Programs. The application is designed to assist the psychologist in determining the level of risk of re-offending (ie high medium or low). This level of risk will determine which program suits the inmates needs. 
        
       
       
        
        In the case of sexual offenders, dynamic risk factors represent those factors which need to be identified and managed in order to reduce the risk to others or potential victims. As Mr Wray denies the sexual offences to which he has been convicted of, it is not possible to develop an understanding of his dynamic risk factors. 
        
       
       
        
        Dynamic risk factors are those which directly relate to the sexual offending behaviour. Whilst static risk factors can be obtained via a review of relevant documentation (eg criminal history, depositions) understanding dynamic risk factors requires the offender to be willing to discuss his thinking patterns, how he dealt with his emotions, lifetime patterns and how he created the opportunity to offend. Examination of the pattern of offending is also important to enable high risk factors to be identified so that management strategies can be developed to minimise those risk factors, if possible. An offender who denies his offending behaviour will not recognise all the factors that led up to and contributed to his offending. Therefore he will not have developed the management strategies needed to deal with those risk factors related to his offending. A court of law has stated that the inmate is guilty of the offence he is incarcerated for. An inmate’s denial of the offence is not an issue. 
        
       
       
        
        In addressing No. 3 although I do not have knowledge of the conversations that Mr Wray had with officers in the department at Junee. I would assume that the officers would know that a requirement of parole is for all inmates to address their offending behaviour. Knowing Mr Wray had not addressed his offending behaviour, they may have assumed it would be more difficult for Mr Wray to be granted parole on his earliest release date.” 
         
          
        
       
      
    4 In many respects this evidence is consistent with that placed before the Court in other cases including Galli v NSW State Parole Authority [2006] NSWSC 206, Esho v Parole Board Authority of NSW [2006] NSWSC 304, DCU v State Parole Authority of New South Wales [2006] NSWSC 526, Lee v State Parole Authority of New South Wales [2006] NSWSC 1225, and Gulliford v New South Wales State Parole Authority [2006] NSWSC 1230. See also the illuminating discussion of the topic in Varney v Parole Board (WA) (2000) 23 WAR 187. Bearing on the harshness or otherwise of the conditions under which a sentence is served, the practice of the Parole Authority it is something of which the Court is entitled to take judicial notice or inform itself – see R v Hallocoglu (1992) 29 NSWLR 67 at 73-4; R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346 at 366. 
     
      
    5 Although the evidence varied from case to case and was directed primarily to the situation of each of the offenders involved it seems clear that, irrespective of an offender’s conduct since sentence in other respects, if an offender convicted of a sex offence or one involving violence fails to participate in a departmental program directed to dealing with tendencies apparent in such an offence, he will not be granted parole at the end of a non-parole period and quite possibly not released until the expiration of the full sentence. Furthermore, if an offender denies his guilt or, except for reasons over which he has no control – see Esho v Parole Board Authority of NSW at [48], is regarded as unable to benefit from a program, the probabilities are that he will not be permitted to participate, with the consequences to which I have referred.  
     
      
    6 Sentencing practice requires that, at least as a general proposition, in determining the sentence in a particular case, a court take into account in addition to the objective circumstances of an offence and the usual subjective circumstances of an offender matters which are calculated to make imprisonment bear more harshly on the offender than offenders generally. Such matters include physical health and disabilities – R v Azar [2000] NSWCCA 26 at [14], R v Gould [1999] NSWCCA 177 at [24]; inability to speak English (unless the offender has come to Australia with a view to committing the offence) – Huang (2000) 113 A Crim R 386 at [18] – [19]; whether the offender is liable to spend his time in prison in conditions harsher than the norm, for example on protection, and the quality or incidents of the particular form of protection likely – York v R (2005) 79 ALJR 1919, R v Perez-Vargas (1986) 8 NSWLR 559 at 563, R v Sukkar [2006] NSWCCA 92 at [5]; Similar sorts of judgments are undertaken when an offender has or will spend time in heavily restricted conditions of bail or in rehabilitation - R v Cartwright (1989) 17 NSWLR 243 at 258, R v Delaney (2003) NSWLR 1(DR), Fowler (2003) 151 CLR 166 at [242]. 
     
      
    7 In R v Hallocoglu it was regarded as relevant that a sentence of periodic detention was no longer to be spent for its duration in periodic detention but partly in that way and partly by way of community service. 
     
      
    8 The portion of a sentence spent in actual custody is undoubtedly harsher than time spent on parole. Given that other factors bearing on the harshness on a sentence are taken into account in the determination of its length, there is much to be said for the view that, if the evidence justifies the conclusion that a particular prisoner will not be granted parole (or granted it for a significantly shorter period than envisaged by the sentence), that fact should be taken into account. 
     
      
    9 However, in Regina v Reyes [2005] NSWCCA 218 the Court refused to regard such a situation as one to be taken into account as a reducing factor in the assessment of a sentence, at least in circumstances where the reduction in the period of offender would be released on parole was due to the offender continuing to deny his guilt. Hislop J has set out in full the passage of the judgment of Grove J in that case dealing with the topic and it is undesirable that I do so more than is necessary to make my observations understandable. 
     
      
    10 Grove J, with whom Wood CJ at CL and Hoeben J agreed, gave 2 reasons for rejecting the claim. His Honour said, at [74 - 75]:- 
     
      
       
        
        “The core of jurisdiction to impose any sentence is guilt of the offender. It is an election of the offender not to accept guilt but it would be inconsistent with the task of the sentencer to make an assessment other than on the basis that guilt has been proved beyond reasonable doubt. 
        
       
       
        
        … It requires little imagination to postulate a situation that, if a persistent claim of innocence after conviction were maintained and this attracted a reduction in sentence, an offender could adopt that position but, after receiving the discounted sentence, alter his stance, undertake a CUBIT program and earn release from the shortened sentence. Once sentence is passed (absent express legislation such as applies to persons who renege on offers to assist law enforcement authority) there is no facility for cancelling a discount received by a manipulative offender.” 
        
       
      
    11 I have some difficulty with both of these reasons. I do not see that recognition of what will, or is likely to occur, involves the assessment of which Grove J spoke. Furthermore a court faced with a claim such as his Honour envisaged could eliminate the dangers of an alteration in stance to which reference was made by imposing longer non-parole and shorter balances of term than it might otherwise have done, recognising in doing so that imprisonment is harsher than parole.12 There are other considerations that arise. As had statutes before it, the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act contemplates that in the ordinary course of imposing a sentence, a court will set 2 periods, a minimum and a maximum term. Both are determined as merited by the offence under consideration taking into account its objective circumstances and the relevant subjective circumstances of an offender, the non-parole period being the minimum period of incarceration that a court determines as required and the maximum being the outer limit of custody merited.13 There is no fixed relationship between these terms. A court has a discretion to vary the relativity between the 2 periods, increasing or reducing the difference. Commonly an increase will be at the expense of the minimum term but as all periods are set in the course of the one mental activity on the part of a sentencing judge, it may well be that increasing the difference may operate to increase the maximum sentence, albeit keeping it within the appropriate range of a proper sentencing discretion. The emphasis on non-parole periods provided by Division 1A of Part 4 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, providing for standard non-parole periods, may tend to exacerbate this effect. A reduction in the “balance of the term”, to use the language of s44 of the Act, will tend to have an opposite effect on the other periods.14 While if the matters referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph are ignored and the determination of relevant period proceeds simply as contemplated in the paragraph before that, the practice of the Parole Authority would seem irrelevant, when regard is had to the length or significance of any balance of term, account should be taken of the practice. There may, for example, be little point in providing any, or an extended, balance of term if it can be predicated that an offender will not be admitted to parole.  
     
      
    15 The practice of the Parole Authority to which I have referred, is a reason why counsel and sentencing judges should perhaps consider more carefully than sometimes occurs the relativity between the non-parole or minimum and maximum terms. Section 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act precludes a balance of term exceeding one-third of the non-parole period unless the court decides there are special circumstances but imposes no limitation on the balance of term being less than one-third. Nevertheless it is very rare for that to occur and if a judge is not disposed to increase the proportion, it seems to be almost automatic, and without reasons, for a balance of term of one-third to be imposed. 
     
      
    16 Of course, it will be a rare case where, at the time of sentence, any such prediction, at least with any reasonable degree of firmness can be made. The fact that an offender pleads not guilty, while consistent with maintaining a stance which, in light of the Parole Authority’s practice, is likely to lead to parole being refused or attenuated if the offender is convicted, is little evidence that the stance will not change.  
     
      
    17 It may well also be that any conclusion that an offender would not be granted parole has as a corollary both that the Parole Board would consider him, and he would in fact be, at significant risk of re-offending and someone who is unable to readjust to community life and therefore someone whose sentence should reflect added emphasis on personal deterrence, and protection of the community. 
     
      
    18 Furthermore, while I regard the matters to which I have referred as relevant, dominating the topic is the fact that for the sort of offences under consideration here the penalty prescribed by Parliament is imprisonment and, so long as a non-parole period imposed by a particular sentence is not excessive when the circumstances are considered in light of the statutory standard, the fact that its operation may have been ameliorated in other circumstances, such as an acceptance of guilt or the availability of programs, does not make that period unfair. 
     
      
    19 Normal sentencing principles mean that in the determination of a non-parole and maximum term, a sentencing judge will take into account his best prognostication about an offender’s prospects of rehabilitation including the matters encompassed within the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act 1999 paragraphs (a) and (f) of s135 and paragraphs (a) and (d) of s135A. However, the statutory scheme means that these things will be looked at again by the Parole Authority together with the other matters to which the sections refer. This will always occur closer, and generally far closer, to an offender’s release date than the time at which sentence was pronounced and commonly with the benefit of information additional, and certainly later, than that possessed by the sentencing judge. 
     
      
    20 The purpose of release on parole after the expiration of a non-parole period is “to provide for mitigation of the punishment of the prisoner in favour of his rehabilitation through conditional freedom, when appropriate …” – Power v R (1974) 131 CLR 623 at 629. One of the functions of the minimum and maximum periods is to provide an interregnum during which the Parole Authority has scope for exercising its discretion. 
     
      
    21 Of course, under s45 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act a judge may decline to set a non-parole period. He may, as has been mentioned, set a very short balance of term and in these ways remove or severely circumscribe the scope for operation of the Parole Authority’s discretion. However, when regard is had to the statutory scheme apparent in the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act, and in particular the ambit of the matters listed for the consideration of the Parole Authority, it would be a rare case where a judge was justified in sentencing an offender in a way which did not include some balance of term or period when an offender would be eligible for parole.  
     
      
    22 I turn then to the particular circumstances of the Applicant. Included in the appeal papers was a deal of material dealing with the Applicant’s efforts to be admitted to programs and with the parole authorities’ assessments of him. These papers showed, inter alia:- 
     
      
       
        
        On 9 November 2004, the Applicant applied to join the “CUBIT, CORE and Custodial Maintenance Programmes” 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        On 30 November 2004, the Applicant’s application for leave to appeal to the High Court was dismissed. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        On 18 April 2005 the Applicant was advised that he had been found unsuitable for the programmes because he was then appealing. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        In May 2005, according to later notes, the Applicant completed a preparatory program “Understanding Sexual Offending”; 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        On 16 September 2005, the Applicant applied again to join the “CUBIT, CORE and Custodial Maintenance Programmes”. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        A file memo of 27 December 2005 refers to the application of September and records that because the Applicant “adamantly maintains he not guilty plea he cannot be accepted into the program”. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        A letter of 10 February 2006 from the department to the Applicant observes that given his record shows a prior conviction for a sexual offence in 1991, and that there were not specialised programs available at that time it might be possible for him to be accepted if his application dealt with that earlier offence (and presumably in a way that accorded with the department’s attitude). 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        A letter of 23 June 2006 from the Department to the Applicant records that he had stated that he believed he had resolved all issues in respect of the earlier offence. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        A memo of 25 July 2006 to the Applicant records that he had been found suitable for the CUBIT program which ran for approximately 6 to 10 months. Handwritten notes on the document, presumably from the Applicant, indicate that he was unhappy at this occurring so close to the expiration of his non-parole period. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Another memo of 16 August 2006 said “At this stage, you are “unsuitable for institutional treatment programs for sexual offenders whilst appealing your sentence. In order to enter the CUBIT/CORE program, your appeal must be resolved first.” 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        A Pre-Release report of 16 August 2006, obviously prepared in connection with a Parole Authority meeting of 15 September, made a number of comments adverse to the Applicant’s suitability for parole. Given the difference in purpose and having regard to reservations I have as to the expertise of the author as to matters relevant to sentence it is proper in this Court to disregard most of what was said. However, it is relevant to note that the document records that “A Static-99 risk assessment undertaken by psychology staff assessed Mr Wray as representing a  
        moderate- 
        high risk of sexual recidivism”.  
        
       
      
    23 Such comfort as the Applicant may derive in having taken into account the fact that he has not been granted parole and is likely not to be for at least some time, is at least offset by this opinion as to his risk of re-offending. The fact that the sentences under appeal are also the Applicant’s second set of convictions itself argues strongly in the same direction. These factors have contributed substantially to my conclusion that the sentence proposed by Hislop J is appropriate. 
     
      
    HISLOP J:  
     
      
       
      Introduction 
       
      
    24 The applicant was charged on indictment on the following counts: 
     
      
       
        
        1. On or about 26 October 1997, at Old Bar in the State of New South Wales, he did have sexual intercourse with R, she being then aged 15 years. 
         
         
        2. On or about 30 October 1997, at Old Bar in the State of New South Wales, he did have sexual intercourse with R, she being then aged 15 years. 
         
         
        3. Between 26 October 1997 and 1 February 1998, at Old Bar in the State of New South Wales, he did assault R, thereby occasioning actual bodily harm to her contrary to the  
        Crimes Act  
        1900 section 59 – maximum penalty imprisonment for 5 years. 
         
         
        4. Between 1 February 1998 and 31 March 1998 at Old Bar in the State of New South Wales, he did assault R, thereby occasioning actual bodily harm to her contrary to the  
        Crimes Act  
        1900 section 59 – maximum penalty imprisonment for 5 years. 
         
         
        5. Between 1 May and 31 May 1998 at Old Bar in the State of New South Wales, he did assault R, thereby occasioning actual bodily harm to her contrary to the  
        Crimes Act  
        1900 section 59 – maximum penalty imprisonment for 5 years. 
         
         
        6. Between 1 May and 31 May 1998, at Old Bar in the State of New South Wales, he did have sexual intercourse with R, she being then aged 15 years contrary to the  
        Crimes Act  
        1900 section 66C – maximum penalty imprisonment for 8 years. 
         
         
        7. On or about 10 October 1998 at Old Bar in the State of New South Wales, he did assault R contrary to the  
        Crimes Act  
        1900 section 61 – maximum penalty 2 years imprisonment. 
         
         
        8. On 7 February 1999, at Old Bar in the State of New South Wales, he did have sexual intercourse with R, without her consent, knowing that she was not consenting thereto contrary to the  
        Crimes Act  
        1900 section 61(1) – maximum penalty 14 years imprisonment. 
        
       
      
    25 The applicant pleaded not guilty to each count. 
     
      
    26 On 15 August 2001 a District Court jury found the applicant guilty on counts 3 to 8 inclusive. Not guilty verdicts were entered in respect of counts 1 and 2. 
     
      
    27 On 16 August 2001 the applicant was sentenced in respect of the offences of which he had been found guilty as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Count 3: fixed term of imprisonment of 4 months; 
         
         
        Count 4: fixed term of imprisonment of 6 months; 
         
         
        Count 5: fixed term of imprisonment of 6 months; 
         
         
        Count 6: fixed term of imprisonment of 3 years; 
         
         
        Count 7: fixed term of imprisonment of 1 month; 
         
         
        Count 8: imprisonment for 7 years to commence on 15 August 2001 and expire on 14 August 2008 with a non-parole period of 5 years and 3 months to expire on 14 November 2006.  
        
       
      
    All sentences were concurrent and commenced on 15 August 2001. 
     
      
    28 The sentencing judge found that the circumstances of the offences were, in essence, as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        R was born on 25 August 1982. She left home at age 14. At age 15 she commenced to reside in a caravan on a property owned by the applicant. The applicant was born on 21 June 1953. He lived in a house on the property. A relationship developed between R and the applicant. Full sexual relations commenced between them after a short time and a dimension of violence developed within the relationship. The count 3 offence occurred when R backchatted the applicant and he began to hit her, grabbed her and pushed her causing her to fall down and hit her head on the side of the bed resulting in loss of consciousness. She said she had bruises all up her arms and around her neck. The count 4 offence occurred when an argument developed and R was punched dragged and pushed around suffering bruising to her upper body, arms, chest and head. The count 5 offence occurred when the applicant held R against the wall by her throat receiving a full hand bruise around her neck and bruises on her upper arms. The applicant later dragged her by her hair to the back door and threw her down the steps. The count 6 offence involved penile/vaginal intercourse when R was aged 15. The count 7 offence occurred when the applicant and R were pushing each other around though no injury was sustained. The count 8 offence occurred on 7 February 1999 in another house on the applicant’s property. By the time of that offence R had ceased to reside on the applicant’s property though there had been episodes of contact between the parties which were initiated on either side and lacking in acrimony. R resisted the applicant and made her lack of consent very clear to him. He, undeterred, continued until sexual intercourse was complete. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
    29 The applicant appealed to this Court as to conviction and sentence. A sentence affidavit was prepared and affirmed by the applicant on 11 April 2003. The affidavit stated, in part:  
     
      
       
        
        2. I have served my sentence so far in protection. I believe I will have to remain in protection for the remainder of my sentence. 
         
        3. I have been informed by the officers of Corrective Services that it is likely that I will have to serve a total sentence of 7 years as I will be ineligible to do the course which they consider relevant to my offending behaviour as I deny the offence. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
       
      
    30 Mr Hodgetts, the Governor of the Metropolitan Special Programs Centre at the Long Bay Prison Correctional Complex swore an affidavit on 13 August 2003. The affidavit annexed a letter from the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and Mr Hodgetts’ response dated 12 August 2003. This affidavit was in response to that affirmed by the applicant on 11 April 2003.31 At the hearing of the appeal counsel for the applicant informed the Court:  
     
      
       
        
        Conviction and sentence appeals have been filed. There is no appeal against sentence per se, however, if the appeal is partially successful which could only be determined once judgment has been delivered, then I seek to rely on the sentence affidavit. 
        
       
      
    32 On 1 October 2003 this Court dismissed the conviction appeal. As to the sentence appeal Grove J (with whom the other members of the Court agreed) said: 
     
      
       
        
        [36] Application was made for leave to appeal against sentence and counsel expressly stated that there was no appeal against sentence ‘per se’. That concession was appropriate as it can be noted that the applicant’s record includes sentences of minimum and fixed terms of 2 years and 5 months imposed in 1991 for offences of threatening to inflict actual bodily harm with intent to have sexual intercourse and sexual intercourse without consent. The application was made to accommodate the eventuality that the appeal was partially successful and acquittal was substituted for conviction on some counts only. 
         
        [37] I would dismiss the appeal and refuse leave to appeal against sentence. 
        
       
      
    33 On 5 December 2003 the applicant sought special leave to appeal to the High Court. The application sought that the convictions be quashed and verdicts of acquittal entered or, in the alternative, a new trial ordered. Special leave was refused. 
     
      
    34 On 8 September 2005 an application for a review pursuant to the Crimes Act 1900 s 474D was refused.35 On 31 July 2006 this Court received a notice of application for leave to appeal and for extension of time for seeking such leave. The application for extension of time stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        The application for leave to appeal was not given within 3 months of conviction or sentence, or during the period within which a notice of intention to appeal or to apply for leave to appeal had effect, for the following reasons: 
         
         
          
          1. Fresh evidence has become available but was not available till recently; 
           
           
          2. This fresh evidence has only recently become provable beyond doubt; 
           
           
          3. Changes to the  
          Crimes – Administration of Sentences Act  
          1999. In October 2005 (parole system reform) has changed the nature of my sentence and my eligibility for parole. This was not the situation till recently. 
          
         
        
       
      
    36 The court had earlier received from the applicant, on 13 June 2006, a document headed grounds of appeal which identified the following grounds: 
     
      
       
        
         
          
         
        1. Fresh evidence (has since CCA refused leave to appeal against sentence CCA 60581/01) has become available that was not available. 
         
         
        2. False and misleading evidence via affidavit was lodged on 12/8/2003 (marked ‘A’ and ‘B’) to CCA against my sentence appeal. This has only recently become provable beyond doubt. 
         
         
        3. My legal representatives did not present my sentence appeal, as instructed, to the Court. 
        
       
      
    37 Subsequently the applicant lodged a number of written submissions. In particular in a document dated 4 May 2006 and headed submissions on sentence he submitted:  
     
      
       
        
        (a) Leave to appeal against sentence was not heard yet refused; 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (b) My legal representatives did not present my sentence appeal as instructed before the court; 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (c) I filed an affidavit dated 11 April 2003 which I relied upon in relation to my appeal on sentence, requesting a reduction because I have been placed into strict protection and would be disadvantaged and deprived which has changed the ‘nature’ of my sentence and eligibility when applying for parole at my earliest release date of 14 November 2006. This has since proven true and was not the intention of the sentencing Judge; 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (d) There was an error in sentencing in that it did not comply with Pearce; 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (e) 2 affidavits were filed 12 August 2003. I now have proof certain matters in the affidavits contain false and misleading statements which were known to be so at the time of writing. 
        
       
      
    38 Further submissions of the applicant dated 22 February 2007 state:  
     
      
       
        
        My submission is based on significant Administrative Miscarriage, which has already happened during the course of my sentence (was not available to the defence or sentencing judge) which has continued regardless of remedies being brought to various parties’ attention … I have consented to and applied to do all programs and have been denied entry due to the wrongful application of legislation/policy. 
        
       
      
    39 The applicant represented himself at the hearing of this matter. The application to extend time, the grounds of appeal and the written submissions were prepared by the applicant. 
     
      
       
      Extension of time 
      
    40 It was accepted by the respondent that there had been no determination on the merits of the application for leave to appeal against sentence in 2003. 
     
      
    41 The initial issue therefore was whether the court should exercise its discretion to grant an extension of time to permit the application for leave to appeal against sentence to be made, the application being some years out of time. 
     
      
    42 The applicant was funded by Legal Aid in the Court of Criminal Appeal in 2003. The legal representatives of the applicant at that appeal gave evidence on the present application. It emerged from that evidence that counsel had concluded the prospects of an appeal against conviction were good but that the sentence was within the range available to the sentencing judge and there was no reasonable prospect of a reduction in it. He advised Legal Aid there was no merit in the sentence appeal unless the appeal against conviction was partially successful. Accordingly, the focus of the legal representatives was upon the conviction appeal and it was not explained to the applicant, adequately or perhaps at all, that he was entitled to pursue a sentence appeal irrespective of the fate of the conviction appeal and independently of the refusal of legal aid for that purpose. 
     
      
    43 The applicant said that at all times he wished to pursue an appeal against sentence if the conviction appeal failed. This was confirmed by his former legal representatives.  
     
      
    44 The respondent did not submit that any relevant prejudice resulted from the delay in seeking leave.  
     
      
    45 In my opinion the circumstances are such as to justify an extension of time in which to pursue an application for leave to appeal against sentence. Accordingly I propose that the application for extension of time in which to seek leave to appeal against sentence be granted and that consideration be given to the substantive issues which have been raised.  
     
      
     
     
      
      Sentence appeal not presented as instructed 
       
      
    46 The applicant asserted that he had understood the 2003 appeal to this Court was against both conviction and sentence and that his affidavit affirmed on 11 April 2003 would be read in the Court and would be relied upon by his legal representatives.47 As appears from paragraphs 31 and 32 hereof the Court of Criminal Appeal was informed that the sentence appeal was only to be enlivened if the conviction appeal was partially successful. As the conviction appeal was wholly unsuccessful the merits of the sentence appeal were not dealt with and there was no reliance on the affidavit affirmed on 11 April 2003. The substantive issues raised by paragraphs 2 and 3 of that affidavit are considered later in this judgment. 
     
      
       
      False evidence 
       
      
    48 The applicant submitted that some of the comments made in the annexure to Mr Hodgetts’ affidavit were false and misleading and this had only recently become provable beyond doubt. 
     
      
    49 Mr Hodgetts’ affidavit was prepared in response to the sentence affidavit of the applicant affirmed 11 April 2003. As the sentence appeal was not pursued at that time Mr Hodgetts’ affidavit and the annexures thereto were not considered by the Court. The contents of Mr Hodgetts’ affidavit and the applicant’s sentence affidavit are before the Court on this application. I therefore turn to the issues raised by the applicant’s sentence affidavit and the “Pearce” issue. 
     
      
       
      Protection 
       
      
    50 The applicant in his affidavit affirmed 11 April 2003 stated that he had served his sentence so far in protection and believed he would have to remain in protection for the remainder of it. He submitted that this would not have been foreseen by the sentencing judge when passing sentence and that his sentence should be adjusted accordingly.  
     
      
    51 Generally speaking, it is appropriate for a sentencing court to take into account the circumstance that a sexual offender may spend his custody in conditions subject to some form of ‘protection’ status – R v Scott [2003] NSWCCA 28. This requires that, at the time of sentence, the court make some prediction about the nature of the custody that will be endured by the prisoner – R v Mostyn (2004) 145 A Crim R 304 at [179].52 However, as appears from his Remarks on Sentence, the sentencing judge had accepted the submission that:  
     
      
       
        
        … although only having spent one night in custody he is already in protective custody and can expect to spend at least a portion of his sentence in that form of custody. That [the applicant] has fears for his safety and in the light of the evidence that has been given in the trial there have been threats made to him and indeed to his solicitor. 
        
       
      
    53 It is apparent that his Honour anticipated at that stage that the conditions of the applicant’s custody in protection would be likely to be harsh. His Honour took that circumstance into account when sentencing the applicant. This was appropriate. No error in this regard is apparent. The applicant has spent much of his sentence at the Metropolitan Special Program Centre. As Bell J observed in Scott at [34], the concerns of ‘protection’ status would seem to be significantly lessened for sexual offenders who are placed in special facilities such as the MSPC. 
     
      
      Pearce 
       
      
    54 His Honour, in assessing the appropriateness of sentence, said he took into account the relationship that existed between R and the applicant and that both the sexual offence counts and the assault counts were representative counts. He proceeded to indicate individual sentences for each count which he assessed having regard to the record of the applicant and the representative nature of the counts but otherwise treating them as separate matters. 
     
      
    55 The individual sentences which his Honour indicated coincided with those ultimately imposed on each count save for count 8. As regards count 8 his Honour indicated a sentence of 6 years imprisonment but imposed a sentence of 7 years imprisonment. His Honour explained his reasons for so doing as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        Accordingly I do include consideration of this offence [count 8] as part of the total criminal conduct rather than as a separate and discrete one. As that offence carries the most serious penalty it is on that offence I will impose the overall head sentence. No discount is accorded because the pleas were of not guilty. In reaching the conclusion as to the overall appropriate sentence I have come to the view that it will be seven years imprisonment.  
        
       
      
    56 In Pearce v R (1998) 194 CLR 610 at 624 it was held: 
     
      
       
        
        A judge sentencing an offender for more than one offence must fix an appropriate sentence for each offence and then consider questions of cumulation or concurrence, as well, of course, as questions of totality. 
        
       
      
    57 This Court has interpreted Pearce as prohibiting the practice of increasing a sentence for one offence merely to reflect the totality of the criminality disclosed by all of the offences for which sentence is being passed – R v Knight [2004] NSWCCA 145, see also R v Hammoud (2000) 118 A Crim R 66 at [67 - 68], R v AEM [2002] NSWCCA 58, McNaughton v R (2006) 163 A Crim R 381, and R v JRD [2007] NSWCCA 55 at [27] and [28]. His Honour thus fell into error in increasing the indicated sentence on count 8 to 7 years.  
     
      
    58 However the principle of totality requires that the effective sentence imposed upon an offender represent a proper period of incarceration for the total criminality involved – AEM at [70].  
     
      
    59 His Honour considered that the total criminality involved required a sentence of 7 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 5 years and 3 months. This conclusion was consistent with sentencing statistics to which his Honour had regard and, in my opinion, was correct. That end result could and should have been achieved by his Honour finding special circumstances by reason of the accumulation of sentences and adjusting the commencement date of the sentences in such a way that the ultimate overall sentence of 7 years with, effectively a non-parole period of 5 years and 3 months was achieved, 
     
      
    60 I would uphold the appeal on this ground, find special circumstances by reason of the accumulation of sentences, and adjust the sentence in relation to count 8 so as to reflect the principle in Pearce and his Honour’s assessment of the overall criminality. 
     
      
      Significant administrative miscarriage 
       
      
    61 The applicant, in his written submissions, asserted there had been administrative failures to adhere to policy, breaches of procedures, failure to act in a timely or equitable fashion and the like in relation to his sentence. 
     
      
    62 Generally speaking, a court will not intervene in relation to such matters. As Street CJ said in R v Vachalec [1981] 1 NSWLR 351 at 353 – 354:  
     
      
       
        
         
          
          … as an Appeal Court, it is not its function, nor is it equipped, to fulfil a continuing supervisory role over the effect of imprisonment upon an individual. Such a matter involves essentially administrative considerations and remedial action involves essentially an exercise of administrative power that this Court does not possess. This Court exercises judicial power; it has no power or authority to give administrative directions regarding the treatment of prisoners. Nor has it power or authority by administrative order to change the character or concomitants of sentences or to bring about total or qualified release of persons in custody. That power and authority resides in the hands of the Executive Government. Administrative miscarriage in the working out of a sentence cannot be remedied by this Court as it has no jurisdiction to enter the administrative field.  
          
         
        
       
      
    See also R v Munday (1981) 2 NSWLR 177 at [178] C-D.  
     
      
    63 Further, Street CJ acknowledged:  
     
      
       
        
        There could, of course, be cases where significant administrative miscarriage was so plainly foreseeable at the time of sentence as to justify this Court finding error in the sentencing decision of the first instance Court. Such cases will be rare. 
        
       
      
    64 The applicant has sought to bring himself within that category. He submitted that: 
     
      
       
        
        (a) he has conducted himself virtually as a model prisoner in the expectation that by so doing he would receive parole at the earliest release date. The non-parole period expired on 14 November 2006. He has not been released to parole and there is no indication if and when he will be.  
         
         
        (b) the reason why he has not been admitted to parole is because he has at all times maintained he was not guilty of the offences of which he was convicted. As a result he was for a long time denied admission to the CUBIT program (a 33 to 52 week long prison based intensive therapy program for men who have sexually abused adults, children or both designed to help them work intensively on changing their thinking, attitudes and feelings which lead to their offending behaviour) the completion of which program was, in practical terms, a prerequisite to his release on parole at the earliest date.  
         
         
        (c) the sentencing judge should have adjusted his sentence in order to take account of the possibility that his refusal to admit guilt would lead to his exclusion from the CUBIT program with the consequence that he would be required to serve his sentence beyond the expiration of the non-parole period. 
        
       
      
    65 Similar submissions were made to this Court in Regina v Reyes [2005] NSWCCA 218. In his judgment Grove J (with whom Wood CJ at CL (as he then was) and Hoeben J agreed) said: 
     
      
       
        
        [72] The respondent seeks to rely upon information presented to the Court in the affidavit of Mr Hutchison, the solicitor in charge of the Prisoners Legal Service of the Legal Aid Commission of New South Wales. In summary, Mr Hutchison testifies that the Parole Board exercising its function with regard in particular to s 135 of the  
        Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act 
         1999 takes the view that it is not in the public interest to grant parole to an untreated sex offender and that the risk of reoffending is high. Alternatively the Parole Board may grant parole only towards the end of sentence (six months is suggested) so that there is only a brief period of parole supervision and monitoring before the sentence expires.  
        
       
       
        
        [73] He claims that this means in practical terms that an offender must undergo therapy programmes of various sorts which are available under the umbrella title CUBIT (Custody Based Intensive Treatment). An offender who wishes to participate in such programmes, but denies offences, is not accepted into the programmes.  
        
       
       
        
        [74] The submission that this should be taken into account as a reduction factor in the assessment of sentence should be rejected. The core of jurisdiction to impose any sentence is guilt of the offender. It is an election of the offender not to accept guilt but it would be inconsistent with the task of the sentencer to make an assessment other than on the basis that guilt has been proved beyond reasonable doubt.  
        
       
       
        
        [75] Counsel referred to no authority for the proposition that this particular risk of service of full sentence could be a factor in assessment. The absence of authority is not surprising. It requires little imagination to postulate a situation that, if a persistent claim of innocence after conviction were maintained and this attracted a reduction in sentence, an offender could adopt that position but, after receiving the discounted sentence, alter his stance, undertake a CUBIT programme and earn release from the shortened sentence. Once sentence is passed (absent express legislation such as applies to persons who renege on offers to assist law enforcement authority) there is no facility for cancelling a discount received by a manipulative offender.  
        
       
      
    66 The submission made on this ground of appeal by the applicant is indistinguishable from the submission with which the court in Regina v Reyes was concerned. It has not been demonstrated that this Court should depart from the conclusion reached in Regina v Reyes. As a matter of comity that decision should be followed. Accordingly, this ground of appeal fails. 
     
      
       
      Conclusion 
       
      
    67 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
        
        1. The time for seeking leave to appeal be extended to the date of the filing of this application for leave to appeal; 
         
         
        2. Leave to appeal granted; 
         
        
       
      
    3. Appeal allowed as to count 8; 
     
      
       
        
       
      
    4. As regards count 8, the sentence is quashed and in lieu thereof the applicant is sentenced to imprisonment for 6 years commencing on 15 August 2002 and expiring on 14 August 2008 with a non parole period of 4 years and 3 months commencing on 15 August 2002 and expiring on 14 November 2006; 5. The sentences as to counts 3 – 7 inclusive are confirmed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: The appellant was tried on an indictment which charged that: 
     
      
       
        
        “Between on or about 10 December 1998 and 20 January 2004 at Balgowlah and elsewhere in the State of NSW, did conspire with an unknown person or persons to cheat and defraud Cynthia Lea Holcombe of sums of money.” 
        
       
      
    2 The indictment contained only one count being the common law offence. 
     
      
    3 Following his conviction the appellant was sentenced to a non-parole period of imprisonment for 2 years and 6 months (less 5 days) with an overall term of 5 years imprisonment less 5 days. He appeals his conviction and seeks leave to appeal his sentence. 
     
      
       
      The outline of the case 
       
      
    4 The facts which the Crown alleged comprised the conspiracy are unusual. In her opening the Crown Prosecutor told the jury that the Crown case was that there was an agreement between the appellant and others to defraud Ms Holcombe of money. The ruse was alleged to involve persuading Ms Holcombe that, in order to receive a payment from the conspirators, she would have to pay them money. 
     
      
    5 Ms Holcombe gave evidence that in about 1999 a man, aged about 60 years, came to her home alone and said that he could repair her roof. He said that he had been working next door and had noticed that her roof had a hole in it. He later returned and told Ms Holcombe that he had completed the task. He said that his charge was $10,000. Ms Holcombe cashed a cheque with her bank for this sum and paid the man the $10,000. She said that she never saw this man again.  
     
      
    6 After quite a time had passed Ms Holcombe said that the first man’s offsider, who she believed to be about 20 years old, came to her home and told her that she had been overcharged for the roof repair and that they had a refund cheque for her. She said that she did not see this man again. About a month later, a man, who Ms Holcombe said called himself George, rang her and said that there was a cheque for her and that he would get it and pay her. However, he said that he required $10,000 in cash in $100 notes in order to be able to obtain the cheque.  
     
      
    7 Later, a person who called himself Tony came to her house. She said that he was clean shaven and aged in his thirties. She said he was of medium height and slight build. He told her that he was going to help her get the cheque back. She made arrangements to meet Tony the next day at the fountain on The Corso in Manly. As requested by Tony she took with her $10,000 in cash which she gave to Tony because “George said (it was necessary) to, keep the cheque alive.” The appellant denied that he was this person called Tony. 
     
      
    8 Ms Holcombe said she met Tony on many occasions and gave him money. They may have met on nearly forty occasions. She also believed that on four occasions she gave money to another man called Paul. She also met Paul at the fountain. She said that Paul was clean shaven in his thirties, rather fat and of medium height. 
     
      
    9 Ms Holcombe said she met with Tony over a period of about five years and believed she had given him about $200,000 “to keep the cheque alive.” The bank records tendered at the trial indicated that she may have lost in excess of $400,000 although not all the money may have been given to Tony. 
     
      
    10 On 17 April 2003 Ms Holcombe met a man called Tony, who was undoubtedly the appellant, when he gave her a cheque for $36,000 which he told her she could bank. She banked the cheque, which was initially cleared, but the entry was later reversed by the bank when the cheque was dishonoured. When she met with the appellant on this occasion he was not clean shaven but had a goatee beard. She was told either by the appellant or George, she was unsure, that after she had banked the cheque she was to repay $27,000 but could keep the other $9,000. 
     
      
    11 After the cheque was dishonoured Ms Holcombe was contacted by a person called Steve Karma. She had not heard from him before. He told her that he had a cheque for $260,000 for her but she would first have to give him $10,000. She told him she did not have this money. She gave evidence that she later heard from Tony who asked her for $10,000 for interest on the cheque but she said she did not have that money either. 
     
      
    12 At about this time the police became involved and telephone intercepts were put in place. The record of various conversations between Ms Holcombe and the appellant was tendered in evidence. The appellant did not dispute that he met Ms Holcombe at The Corso on 17 April 2003 and gave her a cheque for $36,000. He also accepted that he was the Tony who was recorded on the telephone intercepts. However, he maintained that he was not the same person as the person calling himself Tony before that time. He said that he had always worn a beard or “chinny” and was not clean shaven as Ms Holcombe recalled the person whom she had met on the earlier occasions, and called himself Tony, had been. 
     
      
    13 Ms Holcombe was able to identify the appellant’s voice on the tapes of the telephone calls that were played to her. She also identified the appellant in an identification parade and recognised him from a photograph. She said that she had a particular memory of his eyes. She asserted in her evidence on a number of occasions that whether or not he was clean shaven or had a beard, the appellant was the man Tony whom she met and spoke with at various times throughout this extraordinary sequence of events. 
     
      
    14 There were a number of inconsistencies in Ms Holcombe’s evidence. She had difficulty remembering with clarity the number of times she met and paid over money. She was also unsure about the accent of some of the persons she dealt with. She also accepted that there were inconsistencies in her account given to the police and some of the evidence which she gave at the trial. Nevertheless she was certain that the appellant was the man Tony whom she had dealt with and to whom she had paid money on many occasions. She said that George was the person who had made arrangements with her as to how much would be paid and kept telling her that she would be receiving money. However, she said it was Tony who would come and meet her and take the money. She said that he rang in advance in order to organise a time to meet and make the payments. 
     
      
    15 The appellant’s evidence was that he had always acted under the directions of George who he said owed him money. His explanation for taking the $36,000 cheque to Ms Holcombe was that George had said that the $2,000 which George owed the appellant would come from the $36,000 cheque which he gave to Ms Holcombe and from which Ms Holcombe was to repay $27,000. He said that George arranged the meeting with Ms Holcombe and told him what to say. He said that George directed him to call himself Tony and told him what to say in each of his telephone calls with Ms Holcombe. He said that he was not aware of and was not party to any conspiracy. He said he had always worn a “chinny” or a goatee beard until he shaved it off at the commencement of the proceedings. He denied any contact with Ms Holcombe prior to their meeting on 17 April 2003. His case was that there must have been two Tonys involved – one who was clean shaven (not the appellant) and the appellant who had always had a goatee beard. 
     
      
    16 The appellant advances four grounds of appeal. 
     
      
    17 It is convenient to deal with the first two grounds together. 
     
      
       
      Ground 1: There has been a miscarriage of justice as the learned trial judge left to the jury an alternate basis for conviction which had not been the subject of separate charge and not relied upon by the Crown prior to the close of evidence. 
       
       
      Ground 2: the indictment was flawed for latent duplicity and as a result trial proceedings were fundamentally flawed and miscarried. 
       
      
    18 As I have indicated the Crown case at trial alleged that the appellant was the person Tony who had been involved in the conspiracy for a significant period extending well before the meeting of 17 April 2003. The appellant gave evidence and when he was being cross-examined his counsel raised an issue in respect of the line of questioning which the prosecutor was pursuing in relation to the cheque given to Ms Holcombe on 17 April 2003. The cheque was made out on the account of an elderly couple from South Australia who had signed it. The details on the cheque were filled out by another hand. Defence counsel questioned whether the Crown was alleging a separate conspiracy in relation to the cheque. In response, his Honour said that he understood that the Crown alleged only a single, but protracted, conspiracy to extract money from Ms Holcombe.  
     
      
    19 On the following day and after the appellant had ceased giving evidence there was further discussion about the nature of the Crown case. That discussion was resolved when his Honour suggested that an alternate approach to the Crown case was that, although the appellant was only actually involved in the fraud from the time of the meeting on 17 April 2003, he became involved with knowledge of the total conspiracy. The events of 17 April 2003 and those which followed, particularly the telephone calls were part of the total conspiracy which had commenced almost five years previously and by becoming involved, as he did, the appellant made himself part of the conspiracy. 
     
      
    20 In her closing address the Crown Prosecutor summarised the Crown case. She put to the jury that the appellant was the man Tony who had participated throughout the total fraud the handing over of the cheque on 17 April 2003 being the last of the financial dealings between Ms Holcombe and the conspirators. Of the cheque handed over on 17 April 2003 she said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The Crown says that cheque that was handed to her was an act of deception. Deceiving her into believing that this was the cheque that she had been waiting for for quite a long time, and she tells you that it was part payment for the money she had put into the cheque … they were attempting to practice [sic] this deception on her to extract more money from her. She believed that the $36,000 was part payment but she was only allowed to keep the $9,000.”  
        
       
      
    21 The Crown Prosecutor later told the jury that, if they thought Ms Holcombe was mistaken about the appellant being involved from beginning to end, that “he was just as guilty” if he joined the conspiracy later on. 
     
      
    22 In the course of his summing up the trial judge, having discussed the alleged conspiracy in general terms, said: 
     
      
       
        
        “… 
        
       
       
        
        But, as I am sure you will understand, the crucial question in this case is not any of those to which the answers are relatively easy but the one I am quite sure you will find much more difficult, and that is: was the accused one of the two or more persons who were party to this conspiracy? That is the absolute crux of the case. 
         
         
        … 
         
         
        If you had George or even Paul, or if there was absolutely no difficulty in identifying the man called Tony who collected the money over the period from November 1998 up until January 2003, your task will be relatively straight forward, but you have the accused. You have the accused, and I will come back to what the accused has had to say later, but you have a case where the Crown has been, in effect, put on notice that the Crown is going to have to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the man called Tony, who first introduced himself back in the latter part of 1998 … as the person sent by George, was the accused, or, alternatively, and I will attempt to explain this as best I can, because this is a very important aspect of the Crown case which I want to be sure you clearly understand, even if there were two Tonys, or even if you have sufficient doubt to leave that possibility open, the Crown case is that you might still properly find the accused guilty. 
         
         
        Before I elaborate on that, let me just go back over the Crown case which must be proved. Either you must in the end be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the man calling himself Tony, who has been sometimes briefly described as the ‘clean shaven’ Tony, who attended, by prior arrangement, on up to thirty-eight and possibly more occasions over the time in question and collected sums of money from Ms Holcombe on almost every occasion at the fountain in the The Corso in Manly, is the accused. If you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of that, then the Crown has succeeded in associating the accused in the necessary way with the conspiracy of which he has been charged, but, as I said a moment ago, the Crown has taken an alternative position. The Crown has anticipated the possibility that you may in the end not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was the unbearded Tony, the clean shaven Tony, but what you do know on the evidence is that, and this is on the accused’s own admission, that he was the voice at the end of the telephone during the course of those conversations in April and May 2003 which were intercepted by the police. The Crown case is that the only possible interpretation you could place on those conversations, having listened to them very carefully, and having listened very carefully to exactly what was said by the accused in the course of those conversations, and the manner in which he said it, that those were words and those were things said that could only have been a consequence of someone saying those words already being sufficiently aware of what had earlier happened to have, in effect, become a part of the conspiracy. In other words, what the Crown is saying to you in the alternative is that even if you dissociate the two Tonys, and in a sense which I think you understand because of the way in which those descriptions have been used, and you only accept the accused’s involvement from the time he met Ms Holcombe on 17 April 2003 at The Corso and handed her the cheque for $36,000, that although the evidence only associates him with Ms Holcombe from that point on, that the evidence you have would still persuade you beyond reasonable doubt that he could only have been so involved, and he could only have said what he said on the telephone if he had been engaged in the conspiracy, that is, that he knew what was underlying the delivery of the $36,000 cheque. He knew that this was a continuation of the history that goes back to late 1998 and that this was part of, if you like, a further act of reassurance to keep Ms Holcombe’s hopes alive, that she was going to get her money and he was now playing his part in that act of fraud. But please in this respect remember the task the Crown has, and that is to satisfy you beyond reasonable doubt of that level of involvement.” 
        
       
      
    23 The problem which the appellant suggests to have occurred in his trial arose only after he had given evidence. As I have indicated the Crown opened the case on the basis that the appellant was involved in the conspiracy throughout. The appellant’s counsel in opening said that the appellant’s role was confined to the events of 17 April 2003 and the telephone calls thereafter. When, after the appellant had given evidence, the question of the precise manner in which the case was to be left to the jury was raised, counsel for the appellant suggested that the events of 17 April 2003, if they involved a breach of the law, constituted a second conspiracy so that if left to the jury there would be two conspiracies as possible bases for conviction. It was submitted that accordingly, the trial had miscarried and unfairness had resulted from the fact that the conspiracy had not been properly defined, the co-conspirators unknown and relevant sums of money not properly particularised.  
     
      
    24 I am satisfied that this is not the correct way of understanding those events. Prior to April 2003 Ms Holcombe had been defrauded of large sums of money with the promise that she would ultimately have them repaid. The cheque she was given on 17 April 2003 was proffered as a part repayment of those monies and was designed to further the deception at the heart of the conspiracy. The transaction on 17 April 2003 would have brought some benefit to Ms Holcombe if the cheque had been honoured – she would receive $9,000 of the monies owed to her – but the conspirators intended to maintain the ruse through Ms Holcombe and receive from the cheque the additional $27,000. 
     
      
    25 There were concerns at the trial about whether, by reason of the fact that the cheque was made on the account of two persons who had signed the cheque but not completed the details on it, the cheque itself may have been procured by an illegal act. During the course of his Honour’s summing up counsel for the appellant raised this matter in relation to the use of the cheque and asked the trial judge “to make it clear to the jury that there is no suggestion that that in itself was an illegal activity and it has been used by the Crown to show that Mr Page had the knowledge of the previous dealings and had joined the agreement or words something to that effect.” 
     
      
    26 In response to this request his Honour said to the jury: 
     
      
       
        
        “As to the $36,000 cheque, I have just been reminded that it is important, although I did not say anything to the contrary, that you do not again speculate or draw any inappropriate conclusions about the relevance of this $36,000 cheque. The question for example, of whether it was a forgery or whether there was any other impropriety or illegality associated with the drawing of that cheque has absolutely no bearing on this case. If there was any element of fraud involved in that cheque, it was a fraud on the Chamberlains, whose account it was, not on Ms Holcombe. The only relevance of the cheque is that, as the Crown would have you accept, it was instrumental in and part of the bigger picture in which the accused was involved. Whether it was the bigger picture, that is the picture that goes back to the very start of the collection of money fraudulently obtained from Ms Holcombe or the narrower picture of an involvement that actually started in terms of any active involvement on the part of the accused when he delivered that cheque, that is the only relevance of that cheque, that it was an instrument in that process. Any other aspect of it that might have generated some speculation in your mind, particularly in the view of the evidence of the Detective from South Australia, Detective Vagg was it, in the end proved to be of no consequential relevance as far as this case is concerned.” 
        
       
      
    27 It is important to remember that the Crown case was not confined to the events by which Ms Holcombe was given the cheque for $36,000 with the understanding of repayment. The events of 17 April 2003 commenced a sequence of events which included a series of phone calls with Ms Holcombe. The appellant admits that he was the caller. The transcript of the phone calls is too lengthy to include in these reasons. I have both listened to the calls and reviewed the transcript. The phone calls are of considerable significance. They reveal a knowledge by the appellant of Ms Holcombe’s movements, earlier dealings with the conspirators and the requirements of her bank. Some extracts from the conversations are: 
     
      
       
      Call 3 – 29 April 2003: the appellant said “cos normally your bank you have got to wait a couple of days?” 
       
       
      Call 3 – 29 April 2003: the appellant said “well, I suppose if you keep it, its part of your money back, isn’t it?” 
       
       
      Call 7 – 1 May 2003: the appellant said “see at the moment, Cynthia, I am up at your shopping centre at Woolworths.” 
       
       
      Call 8 – 1 May 2003: the appellant said “we will have to start afresh again on some other day, try and work this out.” 
       
      
    28 On the hearing of the appeal the appellant’s counsel submitted that in order to establish the charge the Crown needed to prove that the appellant had agreed to defraud Ms Holcombe of sums of money. It was further submitted that on what was said to be the alternative case Ms Holcombe had not been defrauded. To the contrary it was submitted that she had been given a cheque with the intent that she would keep a substantial portion of the monies. 
     
      
    29 In my view this submission misunderstands the Crown case and the manner in which the case was left to the jury. The Crown never suggested that the events of 17 April 2003 and thereafter constituted a separate conspiracy. Rather those events were said to be in furtherance of the conspiracy which had been occurring over the preceding years. The Crown asked that the case be left with the jury on the basis that if they were not satisfied that the appellant had been involved in the conspiracy throughout they could be satisfied that the appellant knew that his actions on 17 April 2003 and thereafter were in furtherance of the conspiracy. 
     
      
    30 Counsel submitted that by allowing the matter to be left with the jury on this “alternative basis” the appellant had been prejudiced. The particular prejudice identified was said to have arisen from the fact that the appellant had chosen to give evidence. It was said that that decision was made with the knowledge that the Crown was intending to allege that the appellant had been involved in the conspiracy throughout. It was submitted that a different decision may have been made if it had been known that the Crown would submit that the conspiracy would be proved against the appellant even if he only joined it from 17 April 2003. 
     
      
    31 A submission to this effect was not made by counsel at the trial. Although opposition was expressed to the case being left to the jury on the confined basis, it was never submitted that the alteration in the Crown’s position had caused prejudice by reason of the fact that the appellant had been called to give evidence. This is understandable. For my part, whether or not the Crown sought to prove the appellant’s involvement in the whole conspiracy, or, only part of it could not have affected any decision as to whether he would be called to give evidence. The appellant admitted that he had done the later acts but denied knowledge of the conspiracy at that time. He denied any involvement before that time. 
     
      
    32 It is important to appreciate that following discussion of the matter and before counsel addressed the jury, his Honour ruled that the Crown could submit to the jury that the appellant’s involvement in the later events was sufficient to convict him. His Honour also made plain that, if, following final addresses and before his Honour summed up, difficulties remained, his Honour would consider any further application. No application was made that the jury should be discharged and it was not suggested that by reason of the fact that the appellant had given evidence the trial had miscarried. 
     
      
    33 In this Court it was suggested that the evidence revealed latent duplicity in the Crown case. I have already considered the appellant’s submissions that the Crown alleged two conspiracies. However, that submission was the foundation for a submission that the trial was unfair. It was submitted that: 
     
      
       
        
        “The unfairness resulted from the scope of the conspiracy not being properly defined, with the co-conspirators unknown, the sums of money not properly particularised and the dates of the conspiracy spanning over a five year period, even on the alternative case. Fraudulent acts relied upon in the period prior to Ms Holcombe meeting with the appellant on 17 April 2003, namely Ms Holcombe handing over her money was distinctly different from the giving of the cheque at the April meeting. The breadth of the indictment was such that the prosecution failed to distinguish between the primary conspiracy to defraud Ms Holcombe of sums of money and consequential conspiracies to effect other particular frauds.” 
        
       
      
    34 The appellant relied upon the decision of this Court in R v Mok (1987) 27 A Crim R 438. In that case the appellant had been charged with conspiracy to supply a quantity of heroin. He was charged jointly with one other and the conspiracy charged against him was tried together with a charge against a third person of importing the relevant heroin. Mok was convicted but the other two were acquitted. 
     
      
    35 The indictment pleaded the conspiracy as one between the appellant, a named person, Sam and other persons. The way in which the Crown case was ultimately put to the jury by the trial judge was that the conspiracy to supply was one between the appellant, a person by the name of Uncle Hung and the person Sam. It was submitted, and this court accepted that the way the conspiracy was ultimately left to the jury was not how the case was opened by the Crown Prosecutor. The conspiracy which was opened was one between the appellant and Sam only and was confined to facts falling within a narrower compass. 
     
      
    36 It was only during the early part of the trial judge’s directions to the jury that it was determined that the jury would be informed that the conspiracy which they were required to consider was one which extended to involve Uncle Hung. In these circumstances this Court held that the trial had been fought without the accused being fully apprised of the Crown case, the overt acts which constituted the conspiracy and the legal nature of the charge against him and the particular act, matter or thing alleged as the foundation of the charge. 
     
      
    37 Hunt J said at p 441-442: 
     
      
       
        
        “In a conspiracy case, each accused is entitled to precise particulars of the persons with whom it is going to be alleged that he conspired and as to the specific scope of the conspiracy alleged. 
         
         
        … 
         
         
        [the Crown Prosecutor is] not entitled simply to open the overt acts of which particulars which have been given, leaving it to the end of the evidence to select from that evidence the conspiracy which seems to be the strongest. The trial judge and the accused are left in an impossible position if the precise nature of the Crown case is not made clear from the beginning of the trial.” 
        
       
      
    38 Counsel for the appellant submitted that the present case was similar to Mok. I am satisfied that this submission cannot be accepted. In the present case the conspiracy alleged by the Crown was one continuing over many years, involving a number of people, by which Ms Holcombe was defrauded on many occasions of a very significant total sum of money. The Crown opened on the basis that the appellant, who was known to Ms Holcombe as Tony, had been involved in the conspiracy throughout. The defence case was that the appellant knew nothing of the conspiracy and, although he admitted the events of 17 April 2003 and the sequence of telephone calls which followed, he was not aware of the conspiracy and had played no part in it. To this proposition the Crown responded by submitting that even if the jury was not satisfied that the appellant had been involved before 17 April 2003, they should conclude that from that day he became involved with knowledge of the events which had previously led to Ms Holcombe being defrauded. Unlike Mok the Crown did not allege a different conspiracy, merely that the jury could find the appellant to have either been involved throughout or to have joined it at the later date.  
     
      
    39 In my opinion both grounds of appeal 1 and 2 fail. 
     
      
       
      Ground 3: The trial miscarried as a result of the directions to the jury on the elements of the offence of conspiracy to defraud on the case as left in the alternative being incorrect, inadequate or both. 
       
      
    40 The trial judge directed the jury that the fraud was evidenced by the false pretences to Ms Holcombe by which she was persuaded to part with her money. His Honour told the jury that this pretence was “that as long as she continued to make the payments she was requested to make, there would be an ultimate resolution by way of repayment in the form of the cheque which was continually held out to her as coming sometime in the future.” 
     
      
    41 The appellant’s submission with respect to ground 3 again focussed on what was said to be the “alternative case” left to the jury which was described by the appellant in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “The alternative case was then left as ‘a very important aspect of the Crown case’ and the jury directed that ‘even if there were two Tonys, or even if you have sufficient doubt to leave that possibility open, you might still properly find the accused guilty.’ The case against the appellant in this respect was then described as relying on the phone calls, the appellant must have been ‘already sufficiently aware of what had earlier happened to have, in effect, become part of the conspiracy.’ The case was then put as ‘… even if you disassociate the two Tonys … and you accept only the accused’s involvement from the time he met Ms Holcombe on 17 April 2003 at The Corso and handed her over the cheque for $36,000, that although the evidence only associates him with Ms Holcombe from that point on, that the evidence you have would still persuade you beyond reasonable doubt that he could only have been so involved, and he could only have said what he said on the telephone, if he had been engaged in the conspiracy, that is, that he knew what was underlying the delivery of the $36,000 cheque. He knew that this was a continuation of the history that goes back to late 1998 and that was part of, if you like, a further act of reassurance to keep Ms Holcombe’s hopes alive, that she was going to get her money and he was now playing his part in that act of fraud.” 
        
       
      
    42 The appellant submitted that there was a difficulty in leaving the case to the jury in this manner. That difficulty was said to be that giving Ms Holcombe a cheque for $36,000, with the intention that she retain $9,000 for herself, “was not a dishonest means to obtain her money. Dishonest means to obtain the money from the Chamberlains was not the subject of the charge. This opened the way for the conviction of the appellant on the alternative case of a conspiracy based on knowledge that a prior conspiracy had occurred and an act that could not have been in furtherance of that conspiracy as it was neither dishonest means nor dishonest means to obtain sums of money from her.” 
     
      
    43 The appellant’s submission is based upon the misconception of the Crown case to which I have already referred. The Crown did not allege that the handing over of the cheque for $36,000 and the subsequent events were a separate conspiracy. Rather those actions, admittedly committed by the appellant, were said to be part of the overall conspiracy. The difficulties identified by the appellant did not arise. The trial judge made plain the basis upon which the handing over of the cheque and subsequent events could operate to convict the appellant of participating in the alleged conspiracy to defraud Ms Holcombe (see [22] above). It was never described as a separate conspiracy. 
     
      
       
      Ground 4: the verdict of the jury is unreasonable 
       
      
    44 Ms Holcombe gave evidence at the trial in which she said that although she had spoken to the man called George on the telephone her meetings were with men called Tony and Paul. She said that she had first met Tony after George had contacted her by telephone and told her that he was sending a man around to her place to give her the refund cheque but in order to get the cheque, she needed to give him $10,000 in $100 notes. She said that shortly thereafter a “young chap” appeared at her door and said that his name was Tony and that he had been sent by George. She described him as being in his thirties, Australian, medium height of slight build and clean shaven. 
     
      
    45 Ms Holcombe did not give the man the money that day but made arrangements to meet him at the fountain at Manly the following day where she gave the man named Tony $10,000. She said she did this “because George said to. To keep the cheque alive.” 
     
      
    46 She gave evidence that she heard from Tony about twenty times about obtaining a refund. She said that “either he or George would ring me up.” She said that she gave most of the money to Tony but also made four payments to Paul who was “clean shaven, in his thirties, rather fat, and medium height.” 
     
      
    47 Ms Holcombe said that on the occasion when she received the cheque for $36,000 Tony had a goatee beard. She said that she had not seen him like that before. Nevertheless she said that she recognised the Tony with the goatee beard as being the same person as the clean shaven Tony she had previously dealt with. 
     
      
    48 The defence attacked Ms Holcombe’s evidence in which she identified the appellant as the Tony to whom she had given money before 17 April 2003. The appellant’s case was that he had always had a beard (although he had shaved it off for the trial) and accordingly, Ms Holcombe was mistaken in thinking that she had had dealings with the appellant before 17 April 2003. 
     
      
    49 His Honour took the jury to the relevant evidence in the summing up and said that he wished to say something about the question of facial hair. He then said: 
     
      
       
        
        “It was a matter that was given a considerable amount of attention in the course of the evidence in both the evidence of Ms Holcombe and ultimately in the evidence of the accused. What I want to say about it is this. I do not propose, as I have already refrained from doing in the context of a number of other schedules which have been compiled with regard to other aspects of the case, take you painstakingly through date by date. Can I encourage you to examine, critically examine, the photographic evidence? You have a number of exhibits, showing photographs taken of the accused from time to time. As to those photographs taken from the early part of 2003, they are not likely to assist you a great deal because there is no real dispute about the fact that some time prior to May of 2003 and indeed prior to April 2003, and whatever else happened before that, the accused was wearing a beard of the kind described and continued to do so until he shaved it off, on his evidence for the purpose of appearing more neat and tidy in these proceedings. So there is no dispute about what he looked like in 2003. The crucial question is what did he look like from the end of 1998 until the beginning of that year, that is 2003. Was he clean shaven as Ms Holcombe would say, and has said, on all of the occasions he collected money from her, that is of course provided the connection is made that has to be made? The difficulty about it I would suggest to you, is, and this is really in the end what Mr King said and I do not understand the Crown to have suggested anything different, that the photographic evidence and any other history of what he looked like is not conclusive either way for the very reason as Mr King said ‘we do not have a photograph of him every day from November 1998, or December 1998, until January 2003.’ That would be the only conclusive evidence. Anything short of that leaves room for some doubt and of course the doubt becomes more and more pervasive the less we have. The one piece of evidence which I would suggest needs to be carefully scrutinised in this regard is the photograph in Exhibit EE, the photograph used for the purpose of acquiring a New South Wales Driver’s licence at that time. I remind you that February of 2002 was a month, and I am not here getting down to the particular day but was a month in which one of the withdrawals was made and on which you might reasonably infer was passed on by way of a cash delivery to the man calling himself Tony. The accused when shown that photograph said that it looked to him as though there was a week to ten days growth. He certainly would not describe the person as clean shaven. Again I leave it to your judgment as to the degree of growth. I also ask you to look very carefully at the photograph in order to satisfy yourselves whether if there is facial growth overall or there is a sufficient differentiation between growth in the areas where the beard would normally appear and where it would not normally appear. That would be a relevant consideration to whether, even if the accused had not shaved for a while, he was still sporting a beard. But having said that, I would suggest to you that the only likely assistance that that evidence is going to provide is assistance going to the credit of the accused. That is, if, having looked at the photograph yourselves, you find it difficult to accept his assertion that the person in the photograph had a week to ten days growth. But it really does not take the evidence very far with regard to the Tony who appeared on these various occasions to collect money from Ms Holcombe, because it does not connect a clean shaven accused with any visit to the Corso. I will mention in that context one other photograph in the evidence and that is the photograph which was taken on 7 May 2001 and became Exhibit 5, the photograph at the wedding. That was one day before one of the withdrawals and deliveries of money. You are certainly entitled to ask yourselves whether it is likely that having sported a beard at the wedding, the accused shaved it off the next day to meet Ms Holcombe. The Crown would have you come to that conclusion. You will remember the Crown put to you that you are entitled to come to the conclusion if you are satisfied on the rest of the evidence that in fact it was a part of the deception in which the accused was directly involved that, irrespective of his usual habit and his customary appearance, to shave when he saw Ms Holcombe, so that he did in fact present as a demonstrably different looking person from the person he normally was. I suggest you might ask yourselves one question before you take that any further and that is, if that was the case why did he appear with the $36,000 cheque wearing the beard that he had so meticulously shaved off on every other occasion? You might say well that was because he wanted to look like a different Tony. I would suggest if you get to that stage that you are starting on guessing and speculation that I warned you against earlier in the judgment and what this brings me back to is this. The overall evidence with regard to the facial appearance of the accused over the years that is relevant to this case does support to a degree his evidence that that is what he always looked like. Just about all of the photographs were representative of what he looked like all the time and that would exclude the possibility that on thirty eight occasions he turned up clean shaven to collect money from Ms Holcombe. Again, without reiterating everything I have said, and I do remind you that you cannot take any specific observation I made in a vacuum, it is all in the broad context of all the evidence and if that evidence is sufficient to raise a reasonable doubt in your mind then I remind you that you again of where that leads you.” 
        
       
      
    50 After his Honour had invited the jury to retire and consider its verdict Ms Holcombe’s identification of the appellant was again discussed by his Honour with counsel. Counsel for the appellant drew his Honour’s attention to the fact that when he cross-examined Ms Holcombe he said to her “you told the jury a little while ago when my friend asked you this question would you agree with him that the man that you spoke to leading up to you receiving the cheque that the man you spoke to and the man from whom you got the cheque were different and you said: “it is possible.” Ms Holcombe had agreed that it was possible. 
     
      
    51 When his Honour was asked to give a further direction about this matter his Honour said “Well Mr King I think the best I can do is to remind them that you drew attention to these matters and that they are relevant, that they are to be considered as part of the careful scrutiny that I’ve already indicated they must undertake.” Counsel indicated that he was content with that approach. 
     
      
    52 His Honour then gave further directions to the jury. Those directions included a reference to Ms Holcombe’s evidence identifying the appellant. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The two other matters, touch upon matters that were addressed in Mr King’s final address to you but about which I did not have anything specifically to say. I certainly do not want you for that reason to think that you should pay no attention to them. First of all the fact that apart from the evidence of Ms Holcombe, to which I did refer you, namely that when she was asked to put a figure on her level of certainty about the identification in photograph she put it at twenty per cent, there was other evidence she gave, for example, when a question was put to her whether it was possible there were two Tonys she said it was possible. The words she used at the very outset of the photo identification process were to the effect ‘I am not sure about that one’ and you remember she put photograph number eight aside. They are further indications of a measure of uncertainty and, as I have stressed over and over again, not only in the context of identification but also in the context of Ms Holcombe’s evidence as a whole, are matters that along with all of her evidence you have to scrutinise and evaluate with particular care and attention. 
         
         
        Finally, the comment I made about the accent. You remember I suggested that the fact that Ms Holcombe, you might decide, was not very good at identifying or labelling accents did not necessarily mean that she could not identify a voice. I just want to remind you that part of the case put by Mr King was precisely that. Mr King’s submission was that in fact her evidence, when you consider it overall, was sufficient to indicate that she was not very good at making a consistent voice identification even when you put the accent aside. That is a matter that you need to give particular attention to. What you decide about it is of course ultimately for you.” 
        
       
      
    53 In these circumstances the question of whether or not Ms Holcombe’s evidence could be relied upon to identify the appellant as being the Tony to whom she gave money was clearly raised. The jury were told that Ms Holcombe’s account was crucial to the Crown case and that they should carefully scrutinise and evaluate her evidence. Furthermore, they were told that if her evidence was comprehensively unreliable the appellant must be acquitted. They were also told that each problem identified by Mr King had to be considered and discarded before they could convict. The jury were also given careful directions in relation to identification evidence which incorporated the usual caution. 
     
      
    54 I have myself viewed the photographic evidence and carefully considered the evidence of Ms Holcombe. If this was the only evidence implicating the appellant in the conspiracy I would not have been satisfied that the Crown had proved the charge. It would seem that the appellant not infrequently had a “goatee” beard and Ms Holcombe ultimately expressed a reservation as to whether the appellant had been involved throughout.  
     
      
    55 However, the events of 17 April 2003 and the telephone conversations which took place afterwards satisfy me that the appellant was party to the conspiracy. He used a false name Tony which, coincidentally is admitted to be the name used by one of the conspirators who had been involved throughout the conspiracy. The content of the calls and, in particular, those portions to which I have earlier referred leave me in no doubt that the appellant both knew Ms Holcombe and more importantly knew that his actions were part of an ongoing conspiracy to defraud her. His suggestion that the phone calls were made at George’s instigation and that he was prompted by him throughout them is difficult to accept when the transcript is reviewed. It is impossible to believe when the tapes are reviewed. The conversation is spontaneous, the appellant speaking in a familiar manner, clearly giving the impression that he knew all about the previous dealings with Ms Holcombe including the expectation the conspirators had engendered in her that she would ultimately be repaid her money. 
     
      
    56 To my mind it was clearly open to the jury to be satisfied that these conversations were between two people who were quite familiar with each other, leading inevitably to the inference that it was the appellant with whom arrangements had been made and meetings held. 
     
      
    57 It is correct, as the appellant pointed out, that there were some inconsistencies in Ms Holcombe’s evidence. This is not surprising. The events had occurred over a number of years. The appellant pointed to some inconsistencies between Ms Holcombe’s account of the money she gave to Tony and her bank records. She was also unsure as to whether it was George or the appellant who had told her that $27,000 of the $36,000 cheque was to be repaid. There were also occasions when monies were paid on which the appellant was outside Australia. Ms Holcombe recalled the appellant as having an Australian accent when in fact his accent is English. 
     
      
    58 The appellant drew attention to the fact that Ms Holcombe said she was contacted at a later point in time by a person calling himself “Steve Karma” who also requested money following which Ms Holcombe said “Tony” contacted her and requested $10,000. It was submitted that this suggested the possibility of a further conspiracy which did not involve the appellant or George. It was submitted that if the jury were considering “the alternative case” and had rejected the “one Tony theory” it may be that the Tony who allegedly spoke to Ms Holcombe after George was “out of the picture and at a time when “Steve Karma was involved” was the appellant and not some other Tony.” This submission suggests that there was a third Tony involved in defrauding Ms Holcombe. 
     
      
    59 To my mind, although these various matters leave some issues unresolved, it is not necessary to determine them to be satisfied of the appellant’s guilt. The appellant’s admission that he dealt with Ms Holcombe on 17 April 2003 and made the later phone calls and the content of those calls establishes his guilt to the requisite standard. 
     
      
       
      Application for leave to appeal against sentence 
       
      
    60 The appellant was sentenced to a non-parole period of 2 years and 6 months (less 5 days) with an overall term of 5 years. 
     
      
    61 The appellant advanced three grounds of appeal with respect to his sentence. It was firstly submitted that the trial judge erred in failing to exclude “the alternative basis for conviction prior to determining the applicant’s culpability.” It was further submitted that the sentencing discretion miscarried by virtue of the trial judge taking into account as overt acts of the conspiracy involving the applicant the amount of $397,500 to elevate the criminality of the applicant. 
     
      
    62 The appellant correctly identified the fact that the trial judge in his remarks on sentence did not refer to “the alternative case.” His Honour found as in my view was inevitable, that the appellant had been involved in the conspiracy throughout. It was submitted that because the alternative case had been left to the jury “it was necessary for the learned judge to refer to, consider and exclude this as a reasonable possibility prior to finding adversely to the applicant on sentence.” Cheung v The Queen (2001) 209 CLR 1; Olbrich v the Queen (1999) 199 CLR 270. Accordingly, it was submitted that by failing to proceed in this manner the sentencing discretion miscarried and this Court should resentence.  
     
      
    63 With respect to the second ground the applicant submitted that Ms Holcombe gave evidence that she could not recall the amounts she had given to Tony and Paul on around 24 occasions. The bank records in evidence refer to 42 separate withdrawals. Ms Holcombe believed that she had lost an amount of over $200,000. There was also evidence that the bank account continued to operate after January 2003 and that she was not “left with nothing” as the trial judge found. 
     
      
    64 The appellant submitted that he should be sentenced for his part in the agreement to defraud and not for the overt acts. It was submitted that there was no evidence that he had profited from those acts and that his Honour erred in so finding. Furthermore, it was submitted that “where a court, imposing a penalty for conspiracy takes into account the overt acts of the conspiracy, it would be wrong to impose a further penalty in respect of those acts”: R v Hoar (1981) 148 CLR 32 at 38. 
     
      
    65 The appellant accepted that it was proper to take into account Ms Holcombe’s vulnerability and that substantial financial losses had been inflicted upon her but submitted that it was an error to find that the full amount specified and the complete depletion of Ms Holcombe’s finances had been proved beyond reasonable doubt. 
     
      
    66 Finally, the appellant submitted that the sentence was manifestly excessive. His counsel emphasised that the Crown had submitted to the trial judge that guidance as to the appropriate sentence could be obtained by reference to the offence of obtaining money by deception found in s 178BA of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) where the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 5 years. It was submitted that measured by this yardstick the sentence imposed on the appellant was manifestly excessive. 
     
      
       
      Decision on sentence 
       
      
    67 I have already indicated my view that if the evidence had been confined to Ms Holcombe’s belief that it was the appellant who had on many occasions prior to 17 April 2003 taken money from her, the Crown may have had a difficult case. However, it was not so confined. Although the later events point unequivocally to the appellant’s involvement at that time, they also confirm his knowledge of the whole conspiracy. In my opinion, although it was not proven that he was the architect of the conspiracy, his Honour was entitled to sentence him as being “a necessary and … significant part of the conspiracy.” He was clearly at least one of the ‘front men’ even if it was not proven that he was the only ‘front man’. 
     
      
    68 It was apparent at the trial that Ms Holcombe’s memory for specific transactions had faded. This is not surprising. The evidence at the trial independent of Ms Holcombe supported a finding that she had lost $397,500. His Honour concluded that notwithstanding Ms Holcombe’s difficulties the bank records speak for themselves. It was not the appellant’s participation in the overt acts which attracted the criminal sanction but the conspiracy evidenced by the acts done in furtherance of the agreement. That matter was informed by the fact that a lady living on her own was tricked into giving up, if not the whole, a very large proportion of her savings. When evaluating the criminality of the offence, the fact that the deception was repeated on many occasions and the extent of the total monies lost were relevant. The trial judge was correct to consider the amount taken when determining the appropriate sentence. 
     
      
    69 In my opinion the crime committed by these conspirators was deserving of a significant term of imprisonment. This was not a crime of impulse or passion or an isolated incident of aberrant behaviour. Ms Holcombe was a vulnerable woman living on her own. She was callously exploited and her monies taken by a number of people in a most calculated manner. The appellant suggested that some assistance might be obtained from s 178BA of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). However, his Honour was not bound to use this section as a yardstick. The sentence imposed on the appellant was required not only to punish the appellant and deter him from similar conduct but importantly was required to send a message to others who might be considering acting in a similar manner. 
     
      
    70 In my opinion the sentence which his Honour imposed was completely justified. 
     
      
       
      Orders 
       
      
    71 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      1. Appeal against conviction dismissed. 
       
      2. Leave to appeal against sentence granted but the appeal dismissed.

    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with Hislop J. 
     
      
    2 HISLOP J: The applicant pleaded guilty to the offence of supplying not less than the indictable quantity of the prohibited drug 3, 4 – methylenedioxyamphetamine (ecstasy) contrary to the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 s 25(1) (“the Act”). The maximum penalty for such an offence is 15 years imprisonment and/or 2,000 penalty units. 
     
      
    3 On 29 September 2006 the applicant was sentenced for that offence in the District Court to imprisonment by way of a non parole period of 12 months commencing on 29 September 2006 and expiring on 28 September 2007 and a parole period of 1 year 3 months commencing on 29 September 2007 and expiring on 28 December 2008. 
     
      
    4 The applicant has sought leave to appeal against sentence on the grounds that: 
     
      
       
        
        (1) His Honour erred in finding that the applicant’s mental capacity was of no relevance;  
         
         
        (2) The sentence was manifestly excessive. 
        
       
      
    5 The facts may be summarised as follows. On 28 April 2006 police conducted a drug dog operation at the Beverly Hills Hotel. Intelligence which had been received by the police stated that a male bearing the applicant’s description was involved in drug supply at the hotel. Police arrived at the hotel prior to the execution of the drug dog operation and there spoke to the applicant. He told them he had walked to the hotel. Police noticed the applicant’s car nearby. A drug detection dog searched the interior of the vehicle and indicated the presence of drugs. Police searched the vehicle by hand and found a packet of Tic Tacs secreted inside it. The packet contained 62 small white coloured ecstasy tablets. The tablets weighed 12.7 grams and had a purity of 38%. While police were searching the car the applicant received a message on his mobile phone “If at pub, fuck off, cops.” The applicant was arrested and conveyed to Hurstville Police Station. Whilst there another message was received on his mobile phone which read “Can you get it now, need six.” Police were of the opinion that the sender was placing an order for six tablets of ecstasy. 
     
      
    6 The applicant, in a record of interview, told the police that he had been given money by a group of 20 – 30 friends which he had used to purchase the tablets (at $30 each) with the intention they be used at a birthday party which was to be held in the following week. The applicant was not called to give evidence and requested the sentencing Judge accept as accurate his self serving statements to the police, probation officer and psychologist. 7 His Honour did not accept the applicant’s account of how he came to be in possession of the drugs, how they were financed or how they were to be distributed. He believed the applicant lied to police in this regard and also that the second mobile phone message was placing an order for 6 tablets of ecstasy. 
     
      
    8 His Honour, in sentencing the applicant referred to the following subjective factors: 
     
      
       
        
        (a) the applicant was born on 6 March 1961. He was the sole carer of his 21 year old daughter and two sons aged 13 and 14 and had been so for some 10 years. His Honour accepted the applicant was a caring parent who had endeavoured to ensure his children had a good upbringing. His Honour was acutely aware that incarceration would impact upon the children; 
        
       
       
        
        (b) the applicant had engaged in various forms of paid employment including work as a storeman, trades assistant, labourer, courier and, after an apprenticeship, panel beater, before retiring from the workforce to care for his children. In mid 2006 he returned to the workforce obtaining part time employment as a welder; 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (c) the applicant had exerted considerable efforts and sacrificed his own time to coach and encourage children in sporting pursuits; 
        
       
       
        
        (d) the applicant had a criminal history involving minor offences with regards to drugs in 1985 and 1987. His Honour did not regard that history as being of significance for present purposes. Imprisonment for this offence would represent his first time in custody; 
        
       
       
        
        (f) the psychologist, Mr Taylor, reported that the applicant had a low likelihood of recidivism and that he had an IQ of 75; 
        
       
       
        
        (g) the applicant had entered a plea of guilty at the earliest opportunity and was entitled to a discount of 25 percent for the utilitarian value of the plea. 
        
       
      
    9 His Honour found special circumstances by reason of the applicant’s prospects of rehabilitation and the fact it would be his first time in custody. 
     
      
    10 His Honour also had regard to the objective facts of the offence, that the applicant had approximately 10 times the indictable quantity of ecstasy, that the use of drugs had devastating consequences for many users, that the community had a rightful expectation that a person supplying drugs would be subjected to an appropriate penalty to reflect the community’s disapprobation of such conduct and that, though the applicant could not be regarded as a major drug supplier, nevertheless any conduct involving the supply of drugs reflects really serious criminal conduct and must be deterred. His Honour concluded that a full time custodial sentence was the only appropriate penalty in this matter. 
     
      
      Ground One – His Honour erred in finding that the applicant’s mental capacity was of no relevance. 
       
      
    11 His Honour in his Remarks on Sentence said: 
     
      
       
        
        Mr Taylor refers to his I.Q. when he has stated “His full scale I.Q. of seventy five is better than that for only approximately five percent of the people of his age. Mr Carrion’s assessed current level of intellectual functioning is at the upper end of the mildly intellectually handicapped range”.  
         
         
        I do not regard this assessment as being of relevance when considering the question of deterrence. This man had ample intellectual capacity to know exactly what he was doing and to realise the criminality of it. 
        
       
      
    12 The applicant submitted that his Honour erred: 
     
      
       
        
        (a) in finding that the applicant’s impaired level of intellectual functioning was not relevant when considering the question of general deterrence; and 
         
         
        (b) in affording no moderation at all in the consideration of general deterrence. 
        
       
      
    13 It is well accepted that in some cases of an offender suffering from a mental disorder or disability general deterrence is a consideration to which less weight should be given – R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346 at [253] - [254]. The rationale for this conclusion is that such an offender may not be an appropriate medium for making an example to others – R v Scognamiglio (1991) 56 A Crim R 81 at 86. However the significance of the offender’s mental incapacity is to be weighed and evaluated in the light of the particular facts and circumstances of the individual case – R v Bus (NSWCCA unreported 3 November 1995). There is no general principle that a reduced intellectual capacity requires that less weight be given to considerations of general deterrence – R v Elchami (NSWCCA unreported 15 December 1995). 
     
      
    14 In this case there was no evidence that the applicant was suffering from a mental illness or disorder. He had engaged in employment in the community, was in the process of bringing up his 3 children and had involved himself in coaching and assisting local sporting teams. His Honour concluded the applicant had ample intellectual capacity to know exactly what he was doing and to realise the criminality of it. He was fully aware of the gravity of supplying prohibited drugs. As in Elchami “the relevance of the IQ to the mental capacity of the applicant so far as relevant to the commission of the present crime” was not accepted. 
     
      
    15 In my opinion his Honour’s findings were open to him and justified him affording no moderation in the consideration of general deterrence. I reject this ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      Ground Two – The sentence was manifestly excessive 
       
      
    16 The applicant submitted that given the nature of the offence, the applicant’s mental condition, the situation regarding the applicant’s family, the applicable sentencing statistics and the applicant’s antecedents, the sentence was manifestly excessive and, as such, some lesser sentence was warranted at law. 
     
      
    17 The applicant referred to Judicial Commission of NSW statistics which revealed that 75 percent of offenders under s 25(1) of the Act who had supplied less than the commercial quantity of ecstasy were not sentenced to full time imprisonment. It was submitted that as the applicant had 12.7 grams of ecstasy and s 25(1) included a supply of up to 125 grams the applicant was not within the worst 25 percent of cases. It was further submitted that 83 percent of offenders who were charged with only one count to which they pleaded guilty did not receive a full time custodial sentence. 
     
      
    18 In evaluating a sentence the Court may have regard to statistics such as those provided by the Judicial Commission of New South Wales. However, as the sentence to be imposed depends on the facts of each case, bald statistics are of limited use – R v Bloomfield (1998) 44 NSWLR 734 at 739. Greater assistance may be afforded by reference to decided cases, which enable some regard to be had to the details of the specific circumstances. 
     
      
    19 Thus, in the present case, the Crown referred the Court below to R v Chong [2003] NSWCCA 274. In that case this Court reduced a sentence to 3 years with a non parole period of 18 months in circumstances where the offender had 92 ecstasy tablets weighing 27.8 grams, where he was aged 55 years had pleaded guilty promptly and gave full assistance to the authorities, had a history of drug use, a good employment history, was of prior good character, this was his first time in custody and there was a need for supervision and rehabilitation. The offender told police he had purchased the tablets from funds supplied by friends who were to use the drugs at a party. He did not give evidence at the sentence hearing and the sentencing Judge did not accept the accuracy of his explanation to the police.  
     
      
    20 In Markarian v R (2005) 215 ALR 213 at [27] the High Court said:  
     
      
       
        
        [27] The judgment is a discretionary judgment and, as the bases for appellate review reveal, what is required is that the sentencer must take into account all relevant considerations (and only relevant considerations) in forming the conclusion reached. As has now been pointed out more than once, there is no single correct sentence. And Judges at first instance are to be allowed as much flexibility in sentencing as is consonant with consistency of approach and as accords with the statutory regime that applies. 
         
         
        [28] It [is] necessary for [the applicant] to show error in the sentence passed below - either specific error or manifest [excessiveness] … a court of criminal appeal may not substitute its own opinion for that of the sentencing judge merely because the appellate court would have exercised its discretion in a manner different from the manner in which the sentencing judge exercised his or her discretion. 
        
       
      
    21 In this case the applicant asserts that the sentence was manifestly excessive. He must establish upon the facts that the sentence was “unreasonable or plainly unjust” – Dinsdale v The Queen (2000) 202 CLR 321 at 325. 
     
      
    22 In my opinion his Honour took into account all relevant considerations in reaching his conclusion as to the appropriate sentence. That conclusion, in my opinion, was open to him in the proper exercise of his sentencing discretion. It properly reflected the objective and subjective features of the case. It was consistent with the factually similar case of Chong. The sentence was neither unreasonable nor plainly unjust. 
     
      
    23 In my opinion the applicant has not demonstrated error on the part of the sentencing Judge or that the sentence was manifestly excessive and such that some other sentence, less severe, was warranted in law and should have been passed. 
     
      
    24 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
        
        (1) Leave to appeal granted; 
         
         
        (2) Appeal dismissed. 
        
       
      
    25 SMART AJ: The facts are summarised in the judgment of Hislop J. The applicant’s account in his record of interview as to how he came to have 62 ecstasy tablets in his possession defies belief. It could be safely inferred that the offence was not an isolated one and that the applicant was running a small ecstasy tablet supply business from a local hotel and elsewhere to supplement his limited income from the Centrelink Parenting Payment. 
     
      
    26 The applicant was the sole carer for his 21 year old daughter and his two sons who were aged 14 and 13 in September 2006. It is unlikely that the parenting payment would continue while the applicant was in custody and reasonably obvious that these children would have to try and survive on the daughter’s income and any limited payments received for her two younger brothers from the Government. 
     
      
    27 Notwithstanding the number of tablets, they weighed 12.7 grams in total. 
     
      
    28 The first ground of appeal challenges this passage in the sentencing judge’s remarks: 
     
      
       
        
         
          
          “Mr Taylor (the psychologist) refers to his IQ when he has stated ’His full scale IQ of seventy five is better than that for only approximately five per cent of the people of his age. Mr Carrion’s assessed current level of intellectual functioning is at the upper end of the mildly intellectually handicapped range.’ I do not regard this assessment as being of relevance when considering the question of deterrence. This man had ample intellectual capacity to know exactly what he was doing and to realise the criminality of it.” 
          
         
        
       
       
        
       
      
    29 The applicant submits that the judge erred when he held that this assessment was not of relevance when considering the question of deterrence. The judge explained that he took this view because, in his opinion the applicant had ample intellectual capacity to know exactly what he was doing and to realise the criminality of it. 
     
      
    30 In Bus & AS (CCA unrep 3/11/95) Hunt CJ at CL with whom Grove and Allen JJ agreed, held that when sentencing an offenders it was relevant to take into account limited intellectual capacity, little insight into the offending behaviour and little judgment or impulse control. The offender’s shortcomings need not amount to a mental disorder or abnormality. The significance of the offender’s mental incapacity is to be weighed and evaluated in the light of the particular facts and circumstances of the individual case. Hunt CJ at CL said: 
     
      
       
        
         
          
          “The full understanding of the authority and requirements of the law which is attributed to the ordinary individual of adult intellectual capacities cannot be expected of a person whose intellectual functioning is insufficient to have that understanding. The means by which the courts give effect to that principle (as an instrument of social administration) is to moderate the consideration of general deterrence to the circumstances of the particular case. But, if the offender acts with knowledge of what he is doing and with knowledge of the gravity of his actions, the moderation need not be great.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    31 There was evidence from which the judge could infer that the applicant knew that selling or supplying ecstasy tablets was wrong. This is a case where the moderation of the sentence should be small because of the applicant’s limited intellectual capacity, namely “at the upper end of the mildly intellectually handicapped range.” However, in my opinion, it was incorrect for the judge to hold that the applicant’s intellectual handicap was not of relevance when considering the question of deterrence. Such a handicap is likely to affect the offender’s assessment of his conduct. 
     
      
    32 I would also uphold the second ground of appeal on which the sentence is challenged, namely, that it was manifestly excessive. In my opinion, the sentence imposed was unreasonable. 
     
      
    33 The offence was a reasonably serious one but the sentence imposed does not give effect to the strong subjective features of the applicant and is out of line with the general pattern of sentencing in this State for like offences. The NSW Judicial Commission Statistics reveal that 75 per cent of offenders under s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (the Act) who had supplied less than the commercial quantity of ecstasy (125 grams) were not sentenced to full time imprisonment. As the applicant had 12.7 grams of ecstasy it is unlikely that he was within the worst 25 per cent of cases. Further, 83 per cent of offenders who were charged with but one count to which they pleaded guilty did not receive a full time custodial sentence. While the Court does not have the facts of the particular cases and these are of major importance, the sentence imposed in the present case involves a departure from the pattern and level of sentencing in cases for offences under s 25(1) of the Act. 
     
      
    34 The subjective features include: 
     
      
       
        
        (a) The applicant pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity. The judge held that he was entitled to the full discount of 25 per cent. 
        
       
      
     (b) The applicant had never been to prison before. 
     
      
       
        
        (c) He had no relevant prior convictions. The applicant had one recent conviction and that was for a driving offence (PCA – low level). Correctly, the judge did not take into account some old convictions and the driving offence. 
        
       
       
        
        (d) The applicant had over the previous ten years devoted himself to bring up his three children as their sole carer. The two boys were of an age where they needed their father. 
        
       
       
        
        (e) The applicant had assisted with the sports training of his and other children. 
        
       
      
    35 In my opinion the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive. 
     
      
    36 This is not a case where no other sentence was warranted in law. 
     
      
    37 I agree with the judge that there were special circumstances. There are at least reasonable prospects of rehabilitation and with the applicant’s limited intellectual capacity he will benefit from extended supervision. 
     
      
    38 The applicant should be re-sentenced. I take into account the affidavit of 11 May 2007 of the applicant and that of 15 May 2007 of his daughter. The applicant works in the kitchen of the gaol where he is being held. He has completed some life management courses and is in courses teaching job skills. His personal development has been assessed as very good and his industry performance as good. He needs and accepts direction and works well under supervision; he takes pride in his work. He works well as part of a team. While he found work as a cook hard, he did not quit. He requested to return to the plating room. The applicant’s need of supervision is probably a reflection of his limited intellectual capacity. 
     
      
    39 The applicant’s daughter has been the sole carer for her two younger brothers since the applicant’s gaoling. She has a full time her starting hours ranging from 8am to noon and her latest shift finishing at 8pm. She has not been able to obtain help from any of the many welfare agencies she has approached. She says that being the “new” parent has taken its toll on her. She suffers from depression and is sick from stress to the point where she cannot work or is in bed for days at a time. She suffers insomnia. Dr H Basta has referred her to a psychologist for counselling, noting that she  
     
      
       
        
         
          
          “is suffering from insomnia and has been stressed out looking after 2 younger brothers” 
          
         
        
       
      
    40 The daughter has had to defer some studies. No details were supplied. While there must be sympathy for the daughter’s plight the matters mentioned while amounting to hardship probably do not amount to exceptional hardship. 
     
      
    41 Having regard to the objective seriousness of the offence and the applicant’s subjective features he should be re-sentenced. I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
        
        1. Leave to appeal against sentence granted. 
        
       
      
     2. Appeal against sentence allowed. Sentence quashed. 
     
      
       
        
        3. In lieu of the sentence imposed the applicant is sentenced to a non-parole period of 9 months commencing on 29 September 2006 and ending on 28 June 2007 and a balance of term of 9 months commencing on 29 June 2007 and ending on 28 March 2008. Direct that the applicant be released on parole on 29 June 2007. The conditions of parole should provide for the applicant’s supervision by the Probation and Parole Service and for the applicant to comply with the reasonable directions of that Service.

     RONALD JAMES THORNTON v REGINA 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 THE COURT: On 7 March 2005 the appellant was indicted before his Honour Judge Goldring and a jury of 12 in the Campbelltown District Court on the following charges relating to offences committed in the early hours of 11 January 2003: 
     
      
    (a) One count of enter dwelling with intent to commit a serious indictable offence, namely, sexual intercourse without consent contrary to s 111(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (Count 1); 
     
      
    (b) Fourteen counts of sexual intercourse without consent contrary to s 61I of the Crimes Act 1900 (Counts 2, 4-10, 12-17); 
     
      
    (c) One count of attempt to choke with intent to commit a serious indictable offence, namely, sexual intercourse without consent contrary to s 37 of the Crimes Act 1900 (Count 3); 
     
      
    (d) One count of attempt sexual intercourse without consent contrary to ss 61I and 344A of the Crimes Act  900 (Count 11); and 
     
      
    (e) One count of indecent assault contrary to s 61L of the Crimes Act 1900 (Count 18). 
     
      
    2 The appellant pleaded not guilty to each count. On 14 March 2005 the jury returned verdicts of guilty on all counts other than Counts 5, 7, 10 and 14, all of which charged the appellant with sexual intercourse without consent. It follows that the jury returned a verdict of guilty on ten of the fourteen counts charging that offence. Of those ten charges, two (Counts 8 and 15) were particularised as the act of cunnilingus and two (Counts 12 and 16) as the act of fellatio. The remaining six counts of sexual intercourse without consent in respect of which the jury returned a verdict of guilty (Counts 2, 4, 6, 9, 13 and 17) were particularised as the act of the appellant digitally penetrating the complainant’s vagina. Of the four counts in respect of which the jury returned a verdict of not guilty (Counts 5, 7, 10 and 14), each was particularised as the act of the appellant digitally penetrating the complainant’s anus.  
     
      
    3 Of particular significance to the issue raised on the appeal is that Counts 4 and 5, 6 and 7, 9 and 10, 13 and 14 could be said to have arisen out of the same incidents in that Counts 4, 6, 9 and 13 (upon each of which the appellant was found guilty) related to the appellant’s digital penetration of the complainant’s vagina and were simultaneous to Counts 5, 7, 10 and 14 (upon each of which the appellant was found not guilty) of alleged digital penetration of the complainant’s anus. In other words, Counts 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 13 and 14 alleged the appellant’s simultaneous digital penetration of the complainant’s vagina and anus. 
     
      
    4 On 6 September 2005 the appellant was sentenced by the primary judge to the following terms of imprisonment: 
     
      
    (a) On the charge of enter dwelling with intent (Count 1) to a non-parole period of 5 years commencing 14 March 2005 and expiring on 13 March 2010, a total term of 6 years and 3 months expiring on 13 June 2011; 
     
      
    (b) On each of the ten charges of sexual intercourse without consent (Counts 2, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 13, 15, 16 and 17) and the charge of attempted sexual intercourse without consent (Count 11), to a non-parole period of 7 years commencing 14 March 2006 and expiring on 13 March 2013, a total term of 8 years 9 months expiring on 13 December 2014; 
     
      
    (c) On the charge of indecent assault (Count 18), to a fixed term of 3 years and 6 months commencing on 14 March 2006 and expiring on 13 September 2009; 
     
      
    (d) On the charge of attempting to choke (Count 3), to a non-parole period of 8 years commencing 14 March 2007 and expiring 13 March 2015, a total term of 10 years and 6 months expiring on 13 September 2017. 
     
      
    5 His Honour found special circumstances arose from the accumulation of sentences and the principle of totality allowing a variation in the statutory proportion between the non-parole period and the total sentence. The resultant overall sentence of imprisonment was one of 12½ years with a non-parole period of 10 years. The appellant appeals against his conviction and seeks leave of this Court to appeal against the alleged severity of his sentence.  
     
      
       
      The appeal against conviction 
       
      
    6 The only ground of appeal ultimately advanced by the appellant against his conviction was that the jury’s verdicts were inconsistent insofar as he was found to be not guilty on those counts which charged him with sexual intercourse without consent, particularised as the digital penetration of the complainant’s anus, simultaneously with those charges upon which he was found guilty of the same offence, particularised as his digital penetration of the complainant’s vagina. It was therefore submitted that the verdicts of guilty on 14 out of the 18 charges were unsafe and unsatisfactory, as logically they could not stand with the not guilty verdicts on the remaining four charges. 
     
      
    7 Accordingly, the appellant submitted that the verdicts of guilty should be set aside pursuant to s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 on the grounds that they were unreasonable or could not be supported. 
     
      
    8 The appropriate test for determining whether a verdict is unreasonable or unsupportable within the meaning of s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, was authoritatively stated by the High Court in MFA v The Queen (2002) 213 CLR 606; [2002] HCA 53 at 614 [25] and 634 [97]. In so doing the justices accepted that that test was as formulated in the following terms by the majority of the High Court in M v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487 at 493 (and applied by that Court in Jones v The Queen (1997) 191 CLR 439 at 452): 
     
      
       
        
        ""Where, notwithstanding that as a matter of law there is evidence to sustain a verdict, the court of criminal appeal is asked to conclude that the verdict is unsafe or unsatisfactory, the question which the court must ask itself is whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty. But in answering that question the court must not disregard or discount either the consideration that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence or the consideration that the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses. On the contrary, the court must pay full regard to those considerations."" 
        
       
      
    9 In MFA the High Court approved a number of principles enunciated in MacKenzie v The Queen (1996) 190 CLR 348; [1996] HCA 35 at 366–368 in respect of the application of the test in circumstances where the unreasonableness is said to lie in factually inconsistent verdicts of the jury. Thus, Gleeson CJ, Hayne and Callinan JJ stated the following (at 617 [34]): 
     
      
       
        
         
          
          ""Since the ultimate question concerns the reasonableness of the jury's decision, the significance of verdicts of not guilty on some counts in an indictment must necessarily be considered in the light of the facts and circumstances of the particular case. Furthermore, it must be considered in the context of the system within which juries function, and of their role in that system. A number of features of that context were emphasised in  
          MacKenzie 
          . They include the following. First, as in the present case, where an indictment contains multiple counts, the jury will ordinarily be directed to give separate consideration to each count. This will often be accompanied by a specific instruction that the evidence of a witness may be accepted in whole or in part. Secondly, emphasis will invariably be placed upon the onus of proof borne by the prosecution. In jurisdictions where unanimity is required, such as New South Wales, every juror must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of every element in the offence.  
          In the case of sexual offences, of which there may be no objective evidence, some, or all, of the members of a jury may require some supporting evidence before they are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt on the word of a complainant. This may not be unreasonable. It does not necessarily involve a rejection of the complainant's evidence. A juror might consider it more probable than not that a complainant is telling the truth but require something additional before reaching a conclusion beyond reasonable doubt. The criminal trial procedure is designed to reinforce, in jurors, a sense of the seriousness of their task, and of the heavy burden of proof undertaken by the prosecution. A verdict of not guilty does not necessarily imply that a complainant has been disbelieved, or a want of confidence in the complainant. It may simply reflect a cautious approach to the discharge of a heavy responsibility. 
           In addition to want of supporting evidence, other factors that might cause a jury to draw back from reaching a conclusion beyond reasonable doubt in relation to some aspects of a complainant's evidence might be that the complainant has shown some uncertainty as to matters of detail, or has been shown to have a faulty recollection of some matters, or has been shown otherwise to be more reliable about some parts of his or her evidence than about others.  
          Thirdly, there is the consideration stated by King CJ in  
          R v Kirkman 
          , and referred to in later cases: it may appear to a jury, that, although a number of offences have been alleged, justice is met by convicting an accused of some only 
          . And there may be an interaction between this consideration and the two matters earlier discussed."" (Emphasis added) 
          
         
        
       
      
    10 Their Honours then went on (at 617–618 [35]) to reject as erroneous the proposition that where multiple offences are alleged involving the one complainant then verdicts of not guilty on some counts necessarily reflect a view that the complainant was untruthful or unreliable, and that an appellate court should consider the reasonableness of guilty verdicts on the basis that the complainant is a person of damaged credibility. Their Honours thus emphasised (at 618 [36]) that the test established by s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 is unreasonableness, not inconsistency. 
     
      
    11 In their joint judgment in MFA, McHugh, Gummow and Kirby JJ also referred to the principles in MacKenzie noting that the instant case was not one of “legal technical inconsistency” or where ""logic and reasonableness"" necessarily dictated a common approach to the several verdicts concerned. At 630-631 [85] they continued in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        ""In judging suggested inconsistency, this Court said in  
        MacKenzie 
         that 'if there is a proper way by which the appellate court may reconcile the verdicts allowing it to conclude that the jury performed their functions as required, that conclusion will generally be accepted'. The Court cited with approval the remarks of King CJ in  
        R v Kirkman 
         to the effect that juries may not always act 'in accordance with strictly logical considerations' or even 'in accordance with the strict principles of the law which are explained to them'. Juries sometimes give effect to 'their innate sense of fairness and justice' as well as to their sense of proportion and compassion."" 
        
       
      
    12 Their Honours acknowledged (at 631 [86]) that cases did arise where different verdicts returned by a jury represent ""an affront to logic and common sense"" and suggested a compromise in the performance of the jury's duty. However, for the reasons to which we shall refer, we do not consider that the jury's conviction of the appellant on Count 1 can be described this way. We will also explain why we consider that the jury's acquittal of the appellant on Counts 5,7,10 and 14 was not necessarily related to any disbelief of the complainant's evidence. So far as the other counts on which the appellant was found guilty are concerned, as we will demonstrate, the remarks of the Gleeson CJ, Hayne and Callinan JJ which we have emphasised in [9] above are apposite to the present case.  
     
      
    13 Relevant also to the test of whether a jury verdict is “unreasonable, or cannot be supported” within the meaning of s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act is the following passage from the joint judgment of the High Court in M (at 494):  
     
      
       
        
        ""In most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced. It is only where a jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a court of criminal appeal that the court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred. That is to say, where the evidence lacks credibility for reasons which are not explained by the manner in which it was given, a reasonable doubt experienced by the court is a doubt which a reasonable jury ought to have experienced. If the evidence, upon the record itself, contains discrepancies, displays inadequacies, is tainted or otherwise lacks probative force in such a way as to lead the court of criminal appeal to conclude that, even making full allowance for the advantages enjoyed by the jury, there is a significant possibility that an innocent person has been convicted, then the court is bound to act and to set aside a verdict based upon that evidence. In doing so, the court is not substituting trial by a court of appeal for trial by jury, for the ultimate question must always be whether the court thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty."" 
        
       
      
    14 The appellant relied in particular upon the following passages from the judgment of McHugh J in Osland v The Queen (1998) 197 CLR 316; [1998] HCA 75 at 357-358 [120]-[122]: 
     
      
       
        
        ""When there is no legal and technical inconsistency in the verdicts, a conviction can only be set aside where the inconsistency in the verdicts demonstrates that no reasonable jury who had applied their minds to the evidence could have arrived at the two different verdicts. In such a case, the Court of Criminal Appeal sets aside the conviction because it is unsafe or unsatisfactory. In determining whether the inconsistency points to an unsatisfactory conviction, the appellate Court must consider the evidence, the issues and the directions which the jury were given … an examination of the directions, issues and evidence may confirm that apparently inconsistent verdicts are in fact inconsistent and demonstrate that the conviction is unsafe. Just as frequently, however, examination of the issues evidence and directions may show that apparently inconsistent verdicts are not inconsistent and that there has been no failure in the reasoning process of the jury."" 
        
       
      
    15 The appellant submitted that the inconsistency between the verdicts of guilty on the charges of sexual intercourse without consent particularised as the digital penetration of the complainant’s vagina, were so inconsistent with the verdicts of not guilty on the same charges particularised as the simultaneous digital penetration of the claimant’s anus as to demonstrate that no reasonable jury, in applying their minds to the evidence, could have arrived at such different verdicts. This was so, it was contended, given that both the Crown and the defence had conducted the trial upon the basis that the Crown’s case was, to all intents and purposes, totally reliant upon the jury’s acceptance of the reliability and credibility of the complainant’s evidence which could not stand if the appellant’s evidence was accepted or the jury thought it reasonably capable of acceptance. This was because the appellant’s case, in which he acknowledged that he was in the complainant’s house for some 10 minutes but during which she consensually performed fellatio on him, was totally at odds with the complainant’s evidence that the appellant broke into her house and assaulted her both physically and sexually in the manner particularised in the 18 counts over a period of two to three hours. Their versions were diametrically opposed. There was no room for mistake. 
     
      
    16 Furthermore, the appellant submitted that as the trial judge had directed the jury in accordance with R v Markuleski (2001) 52 NSWLR 82; [2001] NSWCCA 290 at 121–122 (known as a Markuleski direction), it was illogical for the jury to have accepted as truthful the evidence of the complainant on the counts upon which the appellant was found guilty but to have rejected as truthful her evidence on the four counts upon which he was found not guilty. Of course, this submission assumes (wrongly as we will demonstrate) that the jury’s verdict of not guilty on those four counts is rationally inexplicable except on the basis that the jury had rejected the complainant’s evidence relating to them as credible or truthful. 
     
      
    17 Thus, from the appellant’s point of view, the high point of the trial judge’s summing up was as follows (S/U –28-29): 
     
      
       
        
        ""One other thing I should tell you is here there are eighteen counts and the evidence of [the complainant] is crucial in respect of each of them. You must scrutinise and examine it very carefully before you find Mr Thornton guilty because, as I have said to you, it is the only evidence in relation to a number of matters that the Crown must prove beyond reasonable doubt before you can be satisfied of the essential ingredients of the charge. 
        
       
       
        
        I have told you at the beginning of the trial that you must consider each of the charges separately, and you must do that. If you are not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that [the complainant’s] evidence is reliable in respect of an essential ingredient of any one of the charges of sexual intercourse without consent, then you may find that it is unreliable in respect of the essential ingredients or one or more of the other charges. It is a matter for you. It may be difficult for you to see how in the circumstances of this case you could not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt in respect of one charge and yet accept it in respect of the others."" 
        
       
      
    18 The appellant pointed to the complainant’s evidence relating to each of the counts which alleged simultaneous digital penetration of her vagina and anus. The relevant exchanges were in the complainant’s evidence in chief. Her evidence relating to Counts 4 and 5 was as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. When he did that, what position were you in? 
        
       
       
        
        A. By this stage I’d pulled my legs up in front of me so I was sort of still crouched on the floor but he was able to put his hand out and have it inside me and he still had a hand over my mouth. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Was he in front of you or behind you? 
        
       
       
        
        A. he was more to the side of me. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Was he standing or -- 
        
       
       
        
        A. No he was crouching down. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And he had a hand over your mouth? 
        
       
       
        
        A. He had one hand over my mouth. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And the other hand? 
        
       
       
        
        A. The other hand he managed to get inside my pants. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Then you said he took you around the throat? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Yes, because when he put his hand in my vagina I jumped with upset the whole thing and I was still trying to scream and put his finger around my throat and I was just found really trouble – I couldn’t breathe, I was gasping for air. I said ‘Don’t do this, I’m a mother’ and that was the last thing that I remember saying. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Why is that, that’s your last memory? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Because I must have passed out because when I came too I was in a completely different position. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Which position were you in when you came to? 
        
       
       
        
        A. My head was facing the front door and my body was along, beside the TV unit. So I was lying like this and the TV was on that side of me. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Looking at the plan, where was your head and where were your feet? 
        
       
       
        
        A. My head was near the word (sic) past TV and my feet were down past the unit. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. So your head up, legs down? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Mm. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. As shown here, and was Mr Thornton still there when you came to? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Yes, he was crouched over me and he had his finger in my vagina and in my anus. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. At the same time? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did he say anything to you whilst he was doing that? 
        
       
       
        
        A. ‘If you don’t do as you are told you may not wake up’. I can’t remember the exact words, I just remember him saying ‘next time you might not wake up’. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. How long did he have his fingers in your vagina and your anus? 
        
       
       
        
        A. While he was talking to me I noted that he had no pressure on me so I pulled my legs up towards me."" 
        
       
      
    19 The complainant’s evidence with respect to Counts 6 and 7 was as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. You told us that he – you came to, to find that his fingers were inside your vagina and your anus, did that happen again after your track suit pants came off? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Yes, he put his finger back in there again when I had pulled my legs up. I pulled my legs up and I remember him grabbing my leg and pulling it back out and that’s when my pants come off me. I remember him putting his finger in me again. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Into your vagina and your anus? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Yes, and I pulled away, he then spread my legs and started to lick me, I started citing off the Our Father."" 
        
       
      
    20 As to the complainant’s evidence with respect to Counts 9 and 10, the relevant exchange was as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. You said he started to lick you, where did he lick you? 
        
       
       
        
        A. In my vagina. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You started praying? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Yes. He told me that wouldn’t help me. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you say anything to him about sex? 
        
       
       
        
        A. I hate sex, why do you think my husband left me. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You told him ‘you hate sex’? 
        
       
       
        
        A. I was trying everything to get him to go away. He said ‘I’m not going anywhere until you come’. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did he put his fingers in your vagina and anus again after he licked you? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Where were you when he did it again? 
        
       
       
        
        A. I’d moved closer, I was not at any angle, my head was probably more closer to the second lounge chair and I was getting closer to the lounge. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. So that’s the third time he did it? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. That is put his fingers in your vagina and anus? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Mm."" 
        
       
      
    21 Finally, the following was the complainant’s evidence in support of Counts 13 and 14: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. What did he do then? 
        
       
       
        
        A. I said ‘No you’ve got children’, he then pulled me down again and put his fingers in my anus and vagina, I wriggled, he then – he licked me again because I remember citing off the ‘Our Father’ and getting it all – I said the whole ‘Our Father’ because I was about to start it again when I realised there was no more pressure on me. And I moved, I moved – pulled myself away. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You told us there was an earlier point at which his penis was making contact with your vagina? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did his penis make contact with any part of you? 
        
       
       
        
        A. He – when he realised that he wasn’t – couldn’t put it in – he didn’t put it inside me, he said ‘You can suck it’. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And what happened then? 
        
       
       
        
        A. I told him I’d bite it off and he said ‘No you won’t’ and he put his thumb to my throat and held me and he stuck it in my mouth. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. His penis. For how long was his penis in your mouth? 
        
       
       
        
        A. I don’t know how long. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You mentioned a moment ago in evidence that there was a fourth occasion he put his fingers in your vagina and anus? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Uh huh. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Was that fourth occasion before or after he placed his penis in your mouth? 
        
       
       
        
        A. It was before."" 
         
        
       
      
    22 The complainant was not cross-examined on this evidence in that it was never put to her, for instance, that the appellant only digitally penetrated her vagina and not her anus. Of course, since the appellant denied that he had penetrated her at all, it was not surprising there was no cross-examination of this kind. 
     
      
    23 After the appellant had left the complainant’s house she immediately complained to a number of persons that she had just been raped by the appellant. One of those complaints was made to a Ms Taplin, who was a Senior Police Constable and with whom she had a conversation at 6am on the morning of 11 January 2003. Ms Taplin made notes of the conversation immediately after it. They relevantly recorded that the complaint said “He didn’t penetrate me, he just put his finger in.” In another part of the conversation, the complainant is recorded as having said to Ms Taplin: 
     
      
       
        
        ""I said to him [the appellant], when he had his fingers in, can’t you come by doing that, because I was so angry, and that’s when he came all over me."" 
        
       
       
      She also called 000 at 6.13am informing the police operator that: 
       
       
        
        ""…he kept fingering me, both holes."" 
        
       
      
    24 When the police arrived between 6am and 6.30am, she was asked whether she was injured. She replied: 
     
      
       
        
        ""He didn’t go inside me except with his fingers."" 
        
       
       
      According to the admitted statement of the ambulance officer who attended the complainant at 6.29am, the complainant said 
       
       
        
        ""that he had penetrated her vagina and anus with his fingers and had attempted to perform oral sex."" 
        
       
      
    25 The point made by the appellant with respect to the evidence which we have recorded above was that it left no room for the jury to find that the complainant had made a mistake when she swore that the appellant had on four occasions digitally penetrated her anus. This being so, it was submitted that the jury must therefore have disbelieved the complainant’s evidence with respect to those four counts. If it had, it must also have had at least a reasonable doubt as to the credibility of her evidence generally and, in particular, with respect to the offences alleged in the other 14 counts. 
     
      
    26 However, as against that possibility is the evidence of Dr Spencer who, on 11 January 2003, was employed at the Liverpool/Fairfield Sexual Service and who examined the complainant on her admission to the Liverpool Sexual Assault Centre at about 9.30am. She gave detailed evidence of the emotional state of the complainant and of the injuries allegedly inflicted upon her during the course of her struggles with the appellant. Relevant to the present issue, she referred to her examination of the complainant to detect the presence of any tenderness, saying that she was able to ascertain the presence of tenderness when the patient reacted to the application of force. In the course of her evidence in chief, the following exchange occurred: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. Did you examine the genital area of [the complainant]? 
        
       
       
        
        A. There was no evidence of any – there was only tenderness, there were no acute lesions in the genital area. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What do you mean by ‘acute lesions’? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Any superficial abrasions or any bleeding or any rupture of the skin in any area. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. But were you able to form the opinion that she was tender in that area, is that right? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Well again you know when I was examining her she was moving as if it was hurting. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you make an examination of her anus? 
        
       
       
        
        A. There was no evidence of any acute lesions in that area at all. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Again no tearing or bleeding or anything like that? 
        
       
       
        
        A. No, nothing like that, it was all normal."" 
        
       
      
    27 In cross-examination, the following exchange took place: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. You examined [the complainant’s] genital area is that right? 
        
       
       
        
        A. That’s true. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And that is typically done during the course of sexual assault allegation examination is that right? 
        
       
       
        
        A. That’s right, yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And indeed the sexual assault kit requires you to go through that process does it not? 
        
       
       
        
        A. That’s right yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. There [w]as a complaint of tenderness to her vaginal area, is that right? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. But you saw no damage whatsoever? 
        
       
       
        
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You observed no damage whatsoever in relation to her anal area, is that right? 
        
       
       
        
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. No reddening? 
        
       
       
        
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. No erythema? 
        
       
       
        
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. No fissures? 
        
       
       
        
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Which are small cracks? 
        
       
       
        
        A. No, nothing. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Or small tears is that right? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Nothing. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. No bruising? 
        
       
       
        
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And certainly no bruising to vaginal area is that right? 
        
       
       
        
        A. No."" 
        
       
      
    28 What is of particular significance in the evidence of Dr Spencer is that she found tenderness in the complainant’s genital or vagina area, but did not suggest that any tenderness was present in her anal area. That fact would, in our opinion, have justified the jury in declining to find the appellant guilty on the four counts relating to the alleged digital penetration of the complainant’s anus, not because she was mistaken in her evidence as to what the appellant was doing to her, but because, notwithstanding that they considered that the complainant was telling the truth, they required (to adopt the observations in the joint judgment of Gleeson CJ, Hayne and Callinan JJ in MFA which I have emphasised in [9] above) something additional before reaching a conclusion beyond reasonable doubt. That “something additional” was corroborative evidence from Dr Spencer as the complainant’s examining medical officer.  
     
      
    29 In this respect Dr Spencer’s evidence of tenderness in the complainant’s genital or vaginal area was supportive of her vagina having been subjected to digital penetration on six occasions, whereas her evidence with respect to the physical injuries visible upon examination of the complainant’s person was supportive of Count 3 which charged the appellant with attempting to choke the complainant. The fact that the jury also found the appellant guilty of the charges preferred in Counts 8, 11, 12, 15 and 16 (fellatio and cunnilingus and attempted sexual intercourse), none of which would have manifested itself in any physical signs on the complainant’s person, was indicative of the fact that the jury considered the complainant generally to be a witness of truth, that is, she was not lying when she claimed to have been sexually assaulted by the appellant on multiple occasions over several hours.. 
     
      
    30 It is also of some relevance that in his final address to the jury, the learned Crown Prosecutor when dealing with the injuries sustained by the complainant as described in Dr Spencer’s evidence, particularly in the context of Count 3 which alleged an attempt to choke the complainant, made the following statement to the jury: 
     
      
       
        
        ""It might have been a bruise depending on how long she was held around the throat. But she was held for long enough to faint and the mark is there to prove it. Perhaps it will be suggested to you and I detected this during the cross-examination of Dr Spencer, ‘Well there is no tearing or bleeding to her vagina or anus’. Well you have heard what it was that Mr Thornton did to her and  
        you will remember that Dr Spencer when she examined [the complainant] found that there was tenderness to the vaginal area 
        . 
        
       
       
        
        The [complainant] isn’t saying to you ‘He raped me by inserting his penis into my vagina’. She is not walking into the witness box and telling you that. She’s telling you that it was with his fingers. That’s bad enough. …"" (Emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    31 This is the only passage in the Crown Prosecutor’s address that specifically referred to the detail of the digital penetration counts. It will be noted that he confined his remarks to the complainant’s vaginal area where Dr Spencer detected tenderness. The jury may well have considered that it was the digital penetration of the complainant’s vagina which was the gravamen of the appellant’s conduct rather than the simultaneous digital penetration of her anus that did not, as far as the evidence went, produce any tenderness in that area.  
     
      
    32 As we have observed, the appellant submitted that on the basis of the manner in which the trial was conducted and in the absence of any room for mistake on the part of the complainant, there could be no explanation for the four not guilty verdicts other than that the jury found the complainant’s evidence unreliable. Accordingly, they could not have logically found her evidence unreliable on the four counts upon which they returned a verdict of not guilty without finding her evidence generally unreliable with respect to the counts upon which they found the appellant guilty. 
     
      
    33 In our opinion the proposition encapsulated in the above submission is far too broad a generalisation as to attract acceptance. In particular, it fails to take account of the following factors:(a) With respect to the digital penetration counts, those alleging digital penetration of the complainant’s vagina were corroborated by the objective evidence of tenderness in that area given by Dr Spencer, whereas there was no objective evidence of tenderness with respect to the complainant’s anal area;(b) The jury may therefore have required something additional before reaching a conclusion upon the counts alleging digital penetration of the complainant’s anus over and above their general acceptance of the complainant’s evidence;(c) Given that the four counts upon which the jury found the appellant not guilty related to alleged digital penetration of the complainant’s anus simultaneous with digital penetration of her vagina, the jury may well have considered that justice was met by convicting the appellant of the vaginal penetration counts and not the simultaneous anal penetration counts. 
     
      
       
        
       
      
    34 It is true that a reading of the complainant’s evidence set out above indicates that she was precise in the detailed manner in which she recounted the various acts of the appellant upon her. Moreover, she did not falter under cross-examination. But as the High Court in the passages to which we have referred above has made patently clear, there are many factors which might cause a jury where there is a multiplicity of offences charged to draw back from reaching a conclusion beyond reasonable doubt in relation to some counts which simply reflects the cautious approach by the jury to the discharge of its responsibilities and which in no way reflects upon their view, evidenced by their findings of guilty on other counts, that the complainant was both a truthful and reliable witness.  
     
      
    35 Equally, notwithstanding the trial judge’s Markuleski direction, the jury were not bound to reject the whole of the complainant’s evidence merely because in respect of the anal digital penetration counts they were not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was guilty of them.  
     
      
    36 Thus there were a number of rational bases upon which the jury could find the appellant not guilty of those counts and yet find him guilty of the balance of the charges preferred against him. It follows that no proper basis has been demonstrated that would justify the setting aside of all (and not just some) of the guilty verdicts on the ground that they were unreasonable or cannot be supported within the meaning of s 6(11) of the Criminal Appeal Act. We would therefore reject the appellant’s challenge to his conviction and dismiss the appeal with respect thereto. 
     
      
       
      The appeal against sentence 
       
      
    37 The appellant’s appeal against the severity of the sentence imposed upon him was ultimately confined to the aggregate non-parole period and the aggregate head sentence. A number of subjective features were highlighted by the written submissions in support of this ground, namely, the appellant’s age at the time of sentence (40), the fact that he had the care and custody of his two young children and was by all accounts a loving and responsible father, the fact that he had and no convictions for sexual offences and had not offended at all since August 1997, the fact that he was in employment and the fact that the offences occurred “as part of a single episode of activity”. 
     
      
    38 There is nothing to suggest that his Honour overlooked any part of the appellant’s subjective case. The “single episode of activity” was accepted by the jury and his Honour to have extended over a period of two to three hours. His Honour rightly remarked that “this was a vicious, violent series of offences which degraded the victim and caused her serious and permanent harm”. There was no remorse and nothing in the way of mitigating circumstances. 
     
      
    39 However, his Honour’s approach to the question of special circumstances is not altogether clear from the remarks on sentence. He said: 
     
      
       
        
        ""I do not understand Mr Conomos who appeared on the last occasion to have urged on me that  
        apart from the requirements of the principle of totality  
        there are any special circumstances in this case which warrant the fixing of longer additional term after the completion of the non-parole periods in respect of any of the sentences for these offences, and indeed  
        I can find no special circumstances other than the requirement of totality as set out by the CCA in the case of  
        Romano  
        and similar cases. The non-parole period will therefore be at a statutory relationship to the total term except where the principle of totality applies a different ratio 
        ."" (Emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    40 It would appear from the portion of the remarks set out in bold above that his Honour intended each of the individual sentences to reflect the statutory proportion, but that the partial accumulation of those sentences would result in the alteration of that proportion, consistent with a finding of special circumstances on that basis. His honour’s reference to R v Romano [2004] NSWCCA 380 (incidentally, an appeal against the severity of an accumulated sentence imposed by his Honour) is consistent with that meaning, as the following extract from the judgment of Adams J (at [31]) makes clear: 
     
      
       
        
        ""The accumulation of sentences should have been a matter that established special circumstances, if only to ensure that Romano would be eligible for parole after he had served 75 per cent of the total effective sentence. This sentence is thirteen years and nine months. There is no reason to suppose that enabling Romano to be released on parole after he had served 75 per cent of his sentence would lead to an inappropriately short period of imprisonment. Accordingly (assuming the total effective head sentence to be correct), he should have been eligible for parole after a little over ten years and three months, rather than the eleven years which Goldring DCJ imposed. In this respect, the attack on the non-parole period has been made good."" 
        
       
      
    41 His Honour then proceeded to sentence the appellant on each individual offence. On Count 1, the non-parole period imposed was four months more than the statutory proportion. On Counts 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 13, 15, 16 and 17 the non-parole period imposed was slightly les than the statutory proportion. When his Honour came to accumulate these sentences, despite his stated intention to find special circumstances, the aggregate non-parole period represented 80% of the aggregate head sentence. 
     
      
    42 Accordingly, some adjustment ought to be made to carry into effect the finding of special circumstances. That said, the criminality of the sustained and brutal assault upon the complainant in the sanctity of her own home warrants, in our view, nothing less than an aggregate non-parole period of 9 years. To achieve this outcome we would quash the sentence on Count 3 and impose in lieu thereof a sentence of 10 years and 6 months imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 7 years. 
     
      
    43 Accordingly, the orders of the Court are: 
     
      
    (a) Appeal against conviction dismissed. 
     
      
    (b) Grant leave to appeal against sentence. 
     
      
    (c) Appeal against sentence allowed in part. 
     
      
    (d) Quash the sentence imposed on Count 3 and in lieu impose a sentence of 10 years 6 months imprisonment to date from 14 March 2007, with a non-parole period of 7 years, expiring 13 March 2014. The appellant is eligible for release to parole on 14 March 2014.

     JAMES DUNCAN SMITH v REGINA 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 BASTEN JA: The sole ground on which the verdict was challenged in the present proceedings was that there had been a miscarriage of justice in that the verdict was unreasonable and could not be supported having regard to the evidence: Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), s 6(1). This ground requires that the Court undertake its own independent assessment of the evidence, to determine whether, even if there were evidence on which the jury could, as a matter of law, convict, it would none the less be dangerous to allow the verdict to stand: see M v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487 at 492-493. As this ground is not based on a question of law alone, leave is required pursuant to s 5(1)(b). No point was taken by the Respondent in that regard and the Court should assume that leave is not opposed. Accordingly, there should be a grant of leave to appeal against conviction. 
     
      
    2 The appeal should be dismissed for the reasons given by Grove J. 
     
      
    3 GROVE J: This appeal challenges the conviction of the appellant on a count of indecent assault on a child of eleven years following trial before Knight DCJ and a jury at Penrith District Court. His Honour sentenced the appellant to imprisonment for a total term of two years with a non parole period of twelve months directing his release at the expiry of the latter on 8 August 2007. The appeal came before this Court on 4 June 2007 pursuant to a notice of appeal dated 25 January 2007.  
     
      
    4 The indictment charged aggravated sexual intercourse without consent in the first count and, alternatively, in the second count indecent assault. The appellant was found not guilty by the jury on the first count. The sexual intercourse charged in the first count was based upon an allegation of digital penetration. It is noted that the Crown Prosecutor, in his address to the jury, stated that they needed to be satisfied that the complainant’s vagina had been penetrated in order to sustain the first count. His Honour’s charge to the jury was to similar effect in relation to that element of proof. The offence is complete upon proof of penetration to any degree of female genitalia and the direction was erroneous but obviously operated to the advantage of the appellant. It was recognized that therein lay a plausible explanation for the verdict on the first count and it was not contended that this verdict was inconsistent with the verdict of guilty on the second count: Mackenzie v The Queen (1996) 190 CLR 348. 
     
      
    5 The appellant relies upon a single ground of appeal asserting that the verdict amounted to a miscarriage of justice in that it was unreasonable and could not be supported having regard to the evidence. The attention to evidence and the approach to determination which this Court must take when such a ground is advanced does not require recapitulation: see M v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487. 
     
      
    6 The Crown case was critically dependent upon the testimony of the complainant. She was aged fourteen by the time the trial took place in May 2006. Her evidence in chief was given by the playing of two video recorded interviews with police made on 29 December 2003 and 25 July 2005 respectively. 
     
      
    7 She had been a friend of the daughter of the appellant. On a weekend in October 2003 she slept over at his house in the lounge room. On the second night of her stay, she said that the appellant came into the room where she was sleeping, pulled down her pants and touched her. She said that she was half asleep and frightened but he just left and on the following morning said to her that she would be in trouble if she told her parents or anyone else about what had happened. 
     
      
    8 There were a number of matters including incidents of the weekend which were canvassed as reference occurrences. The complainant noted her own father’s birthday as 12 October, which in that year was on a Sunday and she located the incident as having occurred on the night of Saturday 11 October. There were explorations of what had happened during her stay including visits for ice skating and to the Ripples swimming pool complex. 
     
      
    9 The appellant gave evidence that he entered the lounge room where the complainant was sleeping and observed that she appeared to be uncomfortable with her legs appearing twisted. He said that he stood next to her and bent down to straighten a sheet and also pulled her t-shirt down because it had ridden up some way on her body. The complainant was lying on a mattress on the floor. He agreed that at the time he gave her a pat on the “tummy” but said this was on top of the sheet. In the second police interview the complainant had described the appellant’s left hand being placed on her “belly”. The appellant denied that he had touched the complainant in any improper way. 
     
      
    10 The appellant’s wife gave evidence that she came into the lounge room and saw him kneeling (as distinct from standing) beside the complainant and was apparently talking to her. In response to her enquiry as to whether everything was “okay”, he nodded affirmatively. She saw nothing untoward. 
     
      
    11 Each of the appellant and his wife disagreed with the complainant’s evidence that she had stayed at their home for two successive nights and they testified that she had stayed overnight for a single night on two occasions separated by about four weeks. The complainant’s evidence was that there was an original intention to stay one night but she asked her mother’s permission to stay another night so that she could participate in some activity with the Smith family, in particular going to the Ripples complex. 
     
      
    12 The complainant’s mother’s evidence was: 
     
      
       
        
        “(the complainant) just asked me that if she could spend the night at (the appellant’s daughter’s) house, which I agreed to. She slept there the first night. That was fine and then the next day when I was supposed to come and pick her up she rang me again and asked me could she sleep a second night, which I agreed to as well because she’s told me that she was going to Ripples the next day in the morning.” 
        
       
       
      And in cross-examination: 
       
       
        
        “Q. How many sleepovers do you say that your daughter had at (the appellant’s daughter’s) house? 
        
       
       
        
        A. On one occasion, two nights. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Well if you were asked to estimate the number of sleepovers, what would you say – one or two? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Two. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And you – I have to suggest to you that in fact there were in fact two separate sleepovers about four weeks apart, each for one night. What do you say about that? 
        
       
       
        
        A. That’s untrue.” 
        
       
      
    13 The submissions of the appellant in support of the ground focussed upon three broad areas of contention. First, it was submitted that the acquittal on the first count meant that “the jury must have had a reasonable doubt as to the credit of the complainant so far as she claimed that there was digital penetration.” It was open to the jury to reach its verdict on this count on the basis that, although they accepted her evidence as to the indecent assault, the trauma of such an incident may have had an effect upon the accuracy of her memory of the precise detail of what occurred. It is significant that they had been directed that proof beyond reasonable doubt was required of penetration of the vagina as distinct from what should have been directed that proof of penetration to any degree of genitalia including externals could complete the offence. 
     
      
    14 It is true that in the complainant’s evidence both on police video interview and in cross-examination she spoke of “touching” her vagina and the appellant’s fingers “inside”. However in the earlier interview, more proximate to the event, she offered a description that he was touching “the sides of it like ….in it but the sides of it.” 
     
      
    15 The complainant also said that she could “see” the appellant’s fingers and making understandable allowance for the descriptive abilities of a young child it does not follow that the jury rejected her credit because they were not prepared to find beyond reasonable doubt that there had been the degree of penetration that they had wrongly been directed was necessary to support conviction on the first count. 
     
      
    16 The second area of contention was based upon an analysis of the complainant’s evidence as to the sequence of events, in particular the trip to Ripples swimming complex. In the initial police interview the complainant was recorded as saying that the appellant warned her not to tell anyone about what happened at a time when the car was being packed for the excursion to Ripples.  
     
      
    17 That conversation, if the jury found that it occurred, would have provided an explanation for the two months’ delay in complaining of the incident to her mother and would have constituted some evidence of consciousness of misconduct on the part of the appellant. 
     
      
    18 In testimony at the trial and when cross-examined she said that the assault occurred after that excursion and she was asked to confirm it in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Is that your recollection now? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Yes.” 
        
       
      
    19 There could hardly have been any threat before the occurrence and by the time of cross-examination, two and half years later the complainant then aged fourteen would no doubt have appreciated this. The cross-examiner returned to the issue and this evidence then emerged: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Well, what’s your best recollection right now? Was the threat made to you before Ripples? 
        
       
       
        
        A. I’m not sure.” 
        
       
      
    20 The third area focussed upon the complainant telling her mother about what had happened on 12 December 2003. At the time that they spoke, the mother gave evidence in chief that her daughter was hysterical and could hardly speak but, as a result of what she did say, the mother rang the police. In cross-examination it was elicited that she later made a note of what her daughter had told her which was to this effect: 
     
      
       
        
        “(M’s dad) touched me. I’m sorry it took so long to tell you because I had to get it right in my mind first because I don’t know if I was dreaming or not.”  
        
       
       
      She agreed that she responded to this by saying: 
       
       
        
         “You weren’t dreaming.”  
        
       
      
    21 I interpolate that this description “touched me” may well have contributed to the jury not being satisfied to the requisite standard that there had been digital penetration to the extent that they had been directed was necessary. 
     
      
    22 It was argued that the mother’s response may have significantly influenced the eleven year old child. This argument was for jury assessment and it is recalled that the complainant raised the matter after, as she said, she got it “right” in her mind. It would be unsurprising if the jury assessed the mother’s remark as words of comfort rather than influence. 
     
      
    23 The strength of these arguments needs to be weighed in the context of the undisputed circumstance that the appellant was in the lounge room and taking some action in the vicinity of the child bedded down on the mattress. The jury manifestly rejected the appellant’s version that he was innocently adjusting the bedding and the complainant’s clothing. His credibility was as much an issue for the jury as was the complainant’s, although it was, of course, necessary to apply the onus of proof. No complaint is made of his Honour’s directions in those regards.  
     
      
    24 I recognize that the evidence of the complainant revealed confusion as to the sequence of events. It is to be recalled that she was a fourteen year old girl giving evidence of what had occurred when she was eleven. Such confusion is no novelty. The observations of McHugh J in M v The Queen at p 534 (although his Honour was in dissent in the result of that appeal) are pertinent: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is the everyday experience of the courts that honest witnesses are frequently in error about the details of events. The more accounts that they are asked to give the greater is the chance that there will be discrepancies about details and even inconsistencies in the various accounts. Of course, it is legitimate to test the honesty or accuracy of a witness’s evidence by analysing the discrepancies and inconsistencies in his or her accounts of an incident. In a case where accuracy of recollection is vital – such as the account of a conversation in a fraud case or the description of a person where identity is the issue – discrepancies and inconsistencies in the witness’s account may make it impossible to accept that person’s evidence, no matter how honest he or she appears to be. But in other cases, discrepancies and inconsistencies may be of far less importance if the honesty of the witness, as opposed to the accuracy of the detail, is the crucial issue. If a jury thinks that the demeanour of the witness or the probability of occurrence of the witness’s general account is persuasive, they may reasonably think that discrepancies or even inconsistencies concerning details are of little moment.” 
        
       
      
    25 As is requisite, I have, without the jury’s advantages, considered the evidence and I am unpersuaded that it was such as to lead to a conclusion that the jury ought to have had a doubt about the guilt of the appellant on the count upon which he was convicted. 
     
      
    26 I propose that the appeal be dismissed.

    JUDGMENT1 HIS HONOUR: This appellant appeals from a sentence of eighteen months with a nine month non-parole, to commence on 23 November 2006 and to expire, so far as the non-parole period is concerned, on 22 August 2007. That sentence was imposed by the Taree Local Court on 10 April 2007 for the offence of breaking and entering and stealing property, namely a packet of Winfield cigarettes, which were the property of Deborah Cox. That offence occurred on 23 November 2006, which is the date on which the offender’s sentence began, so he must have been arrested at that time.2 The facts before me were that he and the complainant, Sarah Whitehead, had been involved off and on in a defacto relationship for the past three and a half years. Ms Whitehead was living at 16 Kanangra Drive in Taree with Deborah Cox and her children. At about 7am on Thursday 23 November, the appellant was pounding on the bedroom window of the complainant, then it would seem, at least as best I can tell, annoying the complainant. 3 At 8.30 he walked to the back door, came into the house, an argument between he and the complainant occurred in the kitchen and he ended up leaving by the front door. She followed him to the front door, pushed the wooden door closed and locked it. 4 The appellant then walked to the complainant’s bedroom window and began to yell at her, “What are you going to fucking hide from me now, Sarah?” She said to him, “Go away Chuck, I’m scared of you.” And she was crouching down. Shortly thereafter there was a big bang at the front door and the door was flung open. The door was opened by virtue of the appellant using his leg to kick the door as though he were someone in a two bit cheap film.  5 He came in, lent over the complainant and said, “Have you got any pot?” She replied, “No I don’t”. Ms Cox said, “That’s it, fuck you Chuck, I’m calling the cops”. She grabbed her mobile. He began to yell, “I didn’t kick your door in Deborah. Fuck I’m going to gaol, just give me a stick.” She said, “If you go now, you're not going to gaol.” 6 On the facts before me the appellant then pulled the complainant from a crouched position, holding onto her with one hand, he took a packet of Winfield blue cigarettes from the fridge, tucked them into his underwear. She said, “They’re not even mine, they’re Deborah’s.” 7 The appellant then pushed her into a lounge chair where he let her go, began to feel around her clothing for money, she moved away and crouched on the ground again. He was arrested and brought to Taree station and thereafter has been in custody.8 An analysis of that behaviour would show that it is the height of immaturity. So what we have here is, in a big body, strong body, somebody who is prepared to behave like an eight year old spoilt brat. Just a reading of it would say to anybody, that this is pitiful behaviour. But the trouble is, not only is it pitiful, it became criminal, probably before, but certainly by the time, you decided to knock the door down like some two bit hero in a two bit western. 9 Clearly there is need for anger management counselling. Clearly there is a need for relationship counselling and it would seem, from your record, there is clearly a need for drug counselling. Indeed one of the comments from you in the course of the facts that I have just recited was a dependence upon drugs and a need for ‘a stick’, which I understand to be a stick of cannabis. 10 When you were giving evidence, I indicated that I was willing to give you an opportunity, the one, to do something about your rehabilitation. That I would be prepared to let you go to the Bridge program at Maitland, which I know to be a very good program and adjourn these proceedings to give you an opportunity to see whether I ought to do anything about the sentence or not. If you continue to be the eight year old tantrum throwing child in the body of an adult, who also happens to be drug dependent, then you can be sure you will be left in gaol to see if that can help you mature. On the other hand, if you rehabilitate, get yourself together, then I am willing to deal with you so that you will not go back into custody. But it may well be that I would suspend the balance of the sentence, depending how good your rehabilitation is.11 Your counsel has made available to me, and now formally tenders, a notice dated 13 June, from the Salvation Army Lake Macquarie Recovery Services, indicating that you have been assessed favourably to attend their ten month Bridge program. You are to be admitted no later than Monday the 18th. It would seem that the Chaplain, Des Cox, of the Mid North Coast Correctional Centre has agreed to transport you to that centre on 18 June 2007, pending your release to the Bridge program.  12 The way in which I propose to do that is to adjourn these proceedings and to give you bail, which may be entered before the Governor of the gaol. The section 11 bail will be conditional and I will have this attached to your warrant, but it will be conditional upon you:(1)Going directly from the gaol, which is Kempsey, Mid North Coast Correctional Centre, to the Salvation Army Lake Macquarie Recovery Services.(2)Bail is not to be granted before Monday 18 June.(3)The appellant is to reside at the Salvation Army Lake Macquarie Recovery Services Centre for the duration of the bail, to obey all reasonable directions of the Director of the centre, or his delegate.(4)Is to comply with all drug testing demands made by the centre. Failure to comply or dirty test is deemed a breach of these bail conditions.(5)The appellant is to accept supervision of Probation and Parole and obey all reasonable directions of the Probation and Parole Service.(6)The appellant is to give progress report to me at the District Court on 26 October next at Newcastle. A further progress report on 15 February 2008 at court to be notified. Matter to be finalised Friday 13 June 2008, at court to be advised.

     NORVENSKA v DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC PROSECUTIONS (CTH) 
     
     
      
    The Applicant, Peter Klaus Norvenska, was the manager of a medical practice in Sydney. Between 1 January 1997 and 28 February 1998, he altered Medicare assignment forms in order to claim higher benefits from the Health Insurance Commission. He was charged with defrauding a public authority under the Commonwealth, pursuant to s 29D Crimes Act 1914 (Cth).At the commencement of the trial on 27 March 2006, the Applicant was represented and pleaded not guilty. Two days later the proceedings were adjourned due to the service of additional material by the prosecution. An additional witness statement was subsequently served on the Applicant in support of the prosecution’s case. On the morning that the proceedings were to recommence, the Applicant had a meeting with his legal counsel, after which he changed his plea to guilty. Prior to the hearing on sentence, the Applicant indicated to his counsel that he wished to change his plea. The Applicant’s counsel withdrew. On 4 August, a notice of motion was filed seeking leave to withdraw the plea of guilty. On 20 October 2006 the motion was heard by Finnane DCJ, who refused the application.The Applicant sought an extension of time in which to appeal from the refusal of leave to withdraw his plea of guilty. Before the Court of Criminal Appeal, the application for extension of time was heard concurrently with the application for leave to appeal and the substantive appeal.The central issue on appeal was whether the Applicant had received inadequate legal advice as to the element of intention in the offence, with the result that his plea of guilty had been entered on the basis of a misunderstanding of the offence.The Court, in granting the extension of time, granting leave to appeal and dismissing the appeal, held:(per Basten JA, Grove and Howie JJ agreeing)1. As counsel for the Director did not address the delay in filing the notice of motion and did not seek to resist a grant of leave, the extension of time and leave to appeal were granted: [10]2. An appeal against an interlocutory judgment, pursuant to s 5F Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), is an appeal by way of rehearing and additional evidence may only be adduced with leave: [12]

    3. Where the accused is represented, a guilty plea may be withdrawn if it can be established that he or she was inappropriately advised and did not appreciate the nature of the charge or did not intend to admit guilt: [27]. The Applicant did not establish that he had received inappropriate legal advice or that he misunderstood the elements of the offence. Accordingly, the appeal should be dismissed: [39]

     NORVENSKA v DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC PROSECUTIONS (CTH) 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 BASTEN JA: On 27 March 2006 the applicant was put on trial before Finnane DCJ in the District Court on an indictment containing one charge. The charge alleged that the applicant - 
     
      
       
        
        “Between about 1 January 1997 and about 28 February 1998 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales did defraud a public authority under the Commonwealth, namely the Health Insurance Commission (commonly known as ‘Medicare’), by dishonest means that is, causing claims for assigned benefits to be submitted to and paid by Medicare in the names of medical practitioners who did not claim those benefits.” 
        
       
      
    2 The applicant entered a plea of not guilty and a trial commenced before a jury, which was ultimately discharged without delivering a verdict, on 29 March 2006. The proceedings were then adjourned to Monday, 3 April 2006. Late in the last week of March, the prosecution served a statement by a Ms Julieanne Hammill, a former Medicare investigator, who had taken steps to investigate a complaint in relation to the alleged alteration of items entered by a doctor on Medicare assignment forms at a location known as City Doctor’s Practice, at 70 Pitt Street, Sydney. The applicant was the manager of the medical practice. The thrust of Ms Hammill’s evidence was that she had met the applicant on 7 August 1997 to discuss changes in the itemised consultations billed through the practice. Her report of the meeting stated that the applicant “agreed that there appeared to a rather large anomaly between the number of hours the Doctor worked and the number of Item 54 consultations claimed”. 
     
      
    3 It will be necessary to return to the significance of this evidence in relation to the charge laid against the applicant, and in the context of other evidence. 
     
      
    4 Counsel then appearing for the applicant, Mr Maurice Gelbert, having received the statement of Ms Hammill took the view that it was new material “of particular significance” to the applicant’s case. He tried to contact the applicant over the weekend, but was unable to speak to him about the material until the applicant arrived in his chambers on the morning of Monday, 3 April. What transpired on that morning became the centre of attention later in the proceedings. Put shortly, following a conference with counsel and a telephone conversation with his solicitor, the applicant attended Court around midday and entered a plea of guilty. The trial judge stood the matter over for sentence to Friday, 19 May 2006 and directed that a pre-sentence report be obtained. Bail was continued. 
     
      
    5 In an affidavit dated 21 July 2006, the applicant stated that he had a further meeting with Mr Gelbert “a few weeks later” (that is a few weeks after Monday, 3 April) at which he stated that he would be changing his plea. The date of that meeting was not identified, but it is common ground that the meeting took place. On 17 May 2006 Mr Gelbert appeared before the trial judge and was granted leave to withdraw. On 22 May other counsel appeared for the applicant and advised the Court that he wished to seek leave to withdraw his plea of guilty. Finnane DCJ gave directions for the filing of a notice of motion and affidavit by 21 July 2006 and listed the motion for hearing on 4 August 2006. The application was eventually heard on 20 October 2006. 
     
      
    6 On 9 March 2007 his Honour delivered judgment rejecting the application: Judgment at [27]. 
     
      
    7 On 27 April 2007 the applicant filed a notice seeking an extension of time within which to appeal from the refusal of leave to withdraw his plea of guilty. It is that application, an application for leave to appeal and the substantive question raised by the appeal, which are now before the Court. 
     
      
       
      Jurisdiction 
      
    8 There was a degree of uncertainty as to whether a conviction was entered on the plea of guilty. The transcript does not record that the applicant was convicted, nor was there any evidence that his conviction was noted on the back of the indictment. Had he been convicted, his right of appeal (subject to the extension of time) would have arisen under s 5 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) and the exercise of this Court’s jurisdiction would be governed by s 6. If, on the other hand, the application was as stated in the notice of motion, an interlocutory application to withdraw a plea, the present appeal would be against an interlocutory judgment, pursuant to s 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act. As the trial judge appears to have proceeded on the motion on the basis that no conviction had been recorded, and as the parties are content to adopt the same course, the matter should be dealt with by this Court on the basis that it is an appeal against the refusal by the trial judge to exercise the discretionary power to grant leave to withdraw a plea. 
     
      
    9 At the hearing on 20 October 2006, the applicant relied upon his own evidence as to what had occurred on the morning of 3 April. The Director relied on affidavits supplied by the applicant’s former counsel (Mr Gelbert), his former solicitor (Mr Gregory Meakin) and a junior solicitor working with Mr Meakin (Mr David O’Connor); it was Mr O’Connor who bore the principal responsibility for preparation of the case with counsel and who attended the meeting in counsel’s chambers on the morning of 3 April. There was also an affidavit from Ms Drennan, then a solicitor with the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions, Sydney office, who had the conduct and carriage of the matter on behalf of the Director. Apart from Ms Drennan, each of the witnesses gave oral evidence, as did another barrister, Ms Elizabeth Cohen. Ms Cohen gave evidence of a conversation with the applicant late on the afternoon of 3 April 2006. 
     
      
    10 In addition to the requirement for an extension of time within which to file the application, the applicant required leave to appeal: Criminal Appeal Act s 5F(3)(a). Counsel for the Director did not address the delay (which was in any event less than an additional 28 days) and did not seek to resist a grant of leave. Accordingly, the application should be considered on the basis that both orders should be made. 
     
      
    11 Section 5F(4) provides that an appeal under that section is to be determined on the evidence given in the proceedings to which the appeal relates, unless, by leave, fresh, additional or substituted evidence is adduced. Such provisions have, in cases involving civil jurisdiction, been relied upon in support of the conclusion that the nature of the appeal is by way of rehearing: see, eg, CDJ v VAJ (1998) 197 CLR 172 at [95]-[101] and Allesch v Maunz (2000) 203 CLR 172 at [22]. As Mr Game SC for the applicant noted, there is a suggestion in the judgment of Hunt CJ at CL in BWM (1997) 91 A Crim R 260 at 265-267, that an appeal pursuant to s 5F “is not by way of rehearing”: at p 265. However, neither Gleeson CJ nor Hidden J joined in his Honour’s comments in that respect. Hunt CJ at CL referred (at p 267) to Alexandroaia (1995) 81 A Crim R 286 at 290, as authority that an appeal pursuant to s 5F was not by way of rehearing. However, the discussion in Alexandroaia at p 290 is to the effect that an exercise of discretion is only reviewable on the grounds identified in House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 499 at 504-505. As Gleeson CJ noted in BWM, at p 261, that is not the same question. What Hunt CJ at CL appears to have meant by an appeal “by way of rehearing” is to be understood by reference to his summary of the applicant’s argument in BWM that “an appeal pursuant to s 5F is by way of rehearing, and that it is for this Court to determine for itself whether the Crown should have leave to withdraw its acceptance of the plea, without first concerning itself with the issue as to whether error had been demonstrated …”: pp 264-5. 
     
      
    12 His Honour also relied, by way of comparison with the terms of s 5F, on the express reference to a “rehearing” in s 5AA(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act. That subsection was repealed by the Courts Legislation Amendment Act 2000 (NSW), Schedule 3, [1]. The explanatory note to the amendment stated that it “removes the requirement that any such appeal is to be by way of a rehearing of the original evidence”. This, however, is not standard use of the terminology. As explained in Coal and Allied Operations Pty Ltd v Australian Industrial Relations Commission (2000) 203 CLR 194 at [13]-[14]: 
     
      
       
        
        “If an appellate tribunal can receive further evidence and its powers are not restricted to making the decision that should have been made at first instance, the appeal is usually and conveniently described as an appeal by way of rehearing. Although further evidence may be admitted on an appeal of that kind, the appeal is usually conducted by reference to the evidence given at first instance and is to be contrasted with an appeal by way of a hearing de novo. In the case of a hearing de novo, the matter is heard afresh and a decision is given on the evidence presented at that hearing. 
        
       
       
        
        Ordinarily, if there has been no further evidence admitted and if there has been no relevant change in the law, a court or tribunal entertaining an appeal by way of rehearing can exercise its appellate powers only if satisfied that there was error on the part of the primary decision-maker. That is because statutory provisions conferring appellate powers, even in the case of an appeal by way of rehearing, are construed on the basis that, unless there is something to indicate otherwise, the power is to be exercised for the correction of error. However, the conferral of a right of appeal by way of a hearing de novo is construed as a proceeding in which the appellate body is required to exercise its powers whether or not there was error at first instance.” 
        
       
      
    Accordingly, adopting the orthodox use of the terminology, an appeal pursuant to s 5F is an appeal by way of rehearing. 
     
      
    13 Such a description of the nature of the appeal does not provide a full indication of the powers of the Court and the limitations on those powers. In an appeal under s 5F, unlike an appeal against conviction following a jury trial, this Court may have the benefit of reasons given by the trial judge, as it did in this case. On the other hand, it does not have the benefit of having seen the witnesses give evidence and respond to cross-examination, which constrains the ability of the Court to interfere with findings as to credibility. In the present case, a significant feature of the applicant’s case for withdrawal of his plea was that he had been subjected to inappropriate pressure to change his plea to guilty, on the morning of 3 April. In his affidavit, he asserted that counsel had told him that he had to plead guilty, that his lawyers were shouting at him and that they would not defend him. These allegations were denied by each of the lawyers and his Honour concluded that no undue pressure had been placed upon him. That factual finding was, understandably, not challenged on appeal.  
     
      
       
      Inadequate or inappropriate legal advice 
      
    14 The focus of the challenge on the appeal was that the applicant had been given inadequate legal advice as to the critical element of intention in relation to the charge, with the result that he had entered a plea on the basis of a misunderstanding as to the law. This issue was not addressed, it was contended, in his Honour’s judgment. 
     
      
    15 At the hearing before Finnane DCJ, counsel then appearing for the applicant put the matter in the following terms (Tcpt, 20/10/06, p 50): 
     
      
       
        
        “At the end of the day, the question is whether or not you are satisfied that he didn’t understand that his knowledge or intention or the dishonest intent was an element of the offence, and as he has said, all he thought he had to do was fill out the documents and that was enough, that it was more or less an offence of absolute liability. 
        
       
       
        
        … There’s no discussion or no evidence that it was explained to him that what he was pleading guilty to was knowing that or that he had to have a dishonest intention, he had to know that it was dishonest to alter the statements.” 
        
       
      
    16 The reasons given by the trial judge for rejecting the application to withdraw the plea were not expansive, nor did they need to be. They dealt in substance with three issues raised on behalf of the applicant, which were whether he understood the charge to which he was pleading, whether undue pressure was placed on him to plead guilty and whether the failure to allow a further change of plea would result in a possible miscarriage of justice. As already noted, he rejected the claim of undue pressure as not having been established on the facts. In relation to the third element, he considered that there was no possible miscarriage of justice because the prosecution case was “overwhelming”: Judgment at [27]. This conclusion may be put to one side for the present. 
     
      
    17 In relation to the advice given, the trial judge accepted the evidence of Mr Gelbert: Judgment at [16]. He then stated at [17]: 
     
      
       
        
        “Mr Gelbert gave advice that the applicant should consider pleading guilty because, in his opinion, he was likely to be convicted, since he had filled in all the incorrect forms and he knew that to do so was wrong.” 
        
       
      
    He also stated that the applicant “made the choice [to plead] after appropriate advice”: at [19]. 
     
      
    18 A two page document was prepared on 3 April 2006, headed “Instructions”. The document constituted an acknowledgment by the applicant that he had conferred with Mr Gelbert and Mr O’Connor, that he had received advice as to a plea of guilty and as to the consequences of such a plea on sentence. 
     
      
    19 The document referred to the applicant’s practice of changing the Medicare forms to ascribe a different item number because he had been advised that “the doctors were allocating the wrong item numbers to the service hence undercharging Medicare”. He also agreed that, during the period referred to in the indictment, the practice was running on an overdraft which was at all times near the limit. He further stated that in altering the vouchers, he adopted no “particular system” but that the alterations were done “on an ad hoc basis”. The document continued: 
     
      
       
        
        “I realize that my actions were without any particular foundation as to how to make the alterations. Even though I felt I was justified in doing what I did I realize that my actions were dishonest in that I was unable to justify the particular entitlement to the $133,563.35. Accordingly I admit my guilt to defraud the HIC (Medicare) by dishonest means. 
        
       
       
        
        During my conference with Maurice Gelbert he has strongly advised me that he feels that I have no prospects of success at trial. He advised me to plead guilty.” 
        
       
      
    20 In the course of the appeal, Mr Game SC sought to establish either that the document (and other evidence) demonstrated that wrong advice had been given, or that the advice had been misunderstood. Before considering those contentions, it is convenient to identify briefly the legal principles relevant to the determination of the application. 
     
      
       
      Legal principles: withdrawal of plea 
      
    21 A plea of guilty to a criminal charge is undoubtedly a serious matter. Nowadays it is accepted as a basic requirement of a fair system of criminal justice that, at least in serious cases, and wherever reasonably practicable, an accused person should have access to legal advice before entering a plea. Nevertheless, the bulk of cases are dealt with on a plea of guilty and it is likely that the system would cease to operate in a timely fashion, were that to change. No doubt many people plead guilty without legal advice. 
     
      
    22 Where advice is obtained, it will often be accepted, although sometimes with reluctance. There are two cases where guilty pleas may eventuate despite a difference of view between lawyer and client. In one category, the accused insists on pleading guilty, despite the advice of the lawyer that he or she is likely to be acquitted if the matter proceeds to a trial. The other category is where the lawyer is convinced that the client is unlikely to be acquitted and that it is in the client’s best interest to plead guilty, but the advice is not accepted. Whatever the circumstances, the person charged may later seek to change a plea. 
     
      
    23 It has long been established that, even after conviction, a plea may be changed and the conviction set aside if it be established that the appellant “did not appreciate the nature of the charge or did not intend to admit he was guilty of it”: see R v Forde [1923] 2 KB 400 at 403, discussed in R v Murphy [1965] VR 187 at 188. Where the accused is legally represented, the court will usually be entitled to rely upon a plea as having been given with an appreciation of the nature of the charge and with an understanding of what was being done. But there may be evidence which contradicts that presumption. 
     
      
    24 The circumstances in which a plea of guilty may be withdrawn were considered in Maxwell v The Queen (1995) 184 CLR 501, but in a context where the primary issue was the right of the trial judge to reject a plea to a lesser offence than that charged. At 510-511, Dawson and McHugh JJ stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “An accused is entitled to plead guilty to an offence with which he is charged and, if he does so, the plea will constitute an admission of all the essential elements of the offence. Of course, if the trial judge forms the view that the evidence does not support the charge or that for any other reason the charge is not supportable, he should advise the accused to withdraw his plea and plead not guilty. But he cannot compel an accused to do so and if the accused refuses, the plea must be considered final, subject only to the discretion of the judge to grant leave to change the plea to one of not guilty at any time before the matter is disposed of by sentence or otherwise. 
        
       
       
        
        The plea of guilty must however be unequivocal and not made in circumstances suggesting that it is not a true admission of guilt. Those circumstances include ignorance, fear, duress, mistake or even the desire to gain a technical advantage. The plea may be accompanied by a qualification indicating that the accused is unaware of its significance. If it appears to the trial judge, for whatever reason, that a plea of guilty is not genuine, he or she must (and it is not a matter of discretion) obtain an unequivocal plea of guilty or direct that a plea of not guilty be entered. But otherwise an accused may insist upon pleading guilty.” 
        
       
      
    25 Read in context, it may be seen that these principles were expressed in relation to the power of the trial judge to reject a plea, rather than as to the circumstances in which an accused may withdraw a plea. The latter point was more directly addressed in the joint judgment of Gaudron and Gummow JJ at 531, in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “There is more to the grant of leave to withdraw a plea than alteration of the record. Ordinarily, it involves a consideration of the circumstances in which the plea was made, with leave being granted if it resulted from a mistake of fact or a misunderstanding of the law, inability to obtain legal representation or if the interests of justice otherwise require.” 
        
       
      
    26 As may be seen from the summary of cases set out by Spigelman CJ in Hura (2001) 121 A Crim R 472 at [32] and [33] and Howie J in Wong v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) (2005) 155 A Crim R 37 at [15], these principles have been stated from time to time in differing language. However, it is not necessary to address the variations in expression. Many of the cases involved an appeal from conviction based on a guilty plea where the statutory test is whether a miscarriage of justice has arisen from the fact that the court acted upon the plea. In principle, no stricter test should be applied to an application before conviction: see R v Middap (1989) 43 A Crim R 362 at 364 (CCA, Vic) and R v Parkes [2004] NSWCCA 377 at [49] (Hodgson JA). 
     
      
    27 It is also common to note the “principles of restraint” identified by Kirby P (Grove and Newman JJ agreeing) in Liberti (1991) 55 A Crim R 120 at 122: 
     
      
       
        
        “For good reasons, courts approach attempts at trial or on appeal in effect to change a plea of guilty or to assert a want of understanding of what was involved in such a plea with caution bordering on circumspection. This attitude rests on the high public interest in the finality of legal proceedings and upon the principle that a plea of guilty by a person in possession of all relevant facts is normally taken to be an admission by that person of the necessary legal ingredients of the offence … .” 
        
       
      
    In some circumstances, the circumspection may be based upon a concern that changes in plea may involve an attempt to manipulate the system to delay a feared conviction and sentence. However, no such issue arose in the present case and the matter should be approached on the basis that if the trial judge should have been satisfied by the applicant that he had been inappropriately advised and did not understand the charge, a miscarriage might well eventuate from an insistence on adherence to the plea. 
     
      
    28 A case in which a change of plea should have been allowed, as held by this Court, was Wilkes (2001) 122 A Crim R 310. In that case the appellant had pleaded guilty in the course of his trial, following the advice of counsel. The advice was given following what was seen to be damning evidence by the accused’s brother, stating that he had seen the accused hitting the deceased with a wooden paling. In summarising the circumstances, Wood CJ at CL, with whom Giles JA and Simpson J agreed stated at [35]: 
     
      
       
        
        “In his second affidavit, counsel [for the accused at the trial] said that upon reflection, he had become concerned that he had not given the appellant any real choice as to whether he should plead or not, and that the appellant had not given him any instructions acknowledging that he had committed the offence. Moreover, it had occurred to him that there were a number of matters he could have put to [the brother] in cross-examination … . He added that there was also an opportunity, which he now saw, for cross-examination the various civilian eyewitnesses, some of whose recollections may have been affected by the alcohol that they, and others present at the caravan park, appear to have been consuming that day.” 
        
       
      
    29 After considering other aspects of possible cross-examination, his Honour continued at [39] and [40]: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is evident from the terms of the exchange deposed to by counsel that the appellant did not acknowledge his guilt and, if anything, was protesting his innocence. The clear inferences that he was suggesting were that it may well have been his brother John Wilkes and Mr Payne who had been responsible for the killing, that they could be putting their heads together to attribute the blame to him … . 
        
       
       
        
        Although no evidence was given by the appellant to us expressly asserting his innocence, the inference to be drawn from the entirety of the evidence before us is that the plea of guilty was entered solely because of the advice which he had received as to the likely outcome of the trial. That advice, as I have observed, counsel now regards as having been incorrect and imprudent. Moreover, if the facts are as has been stated, then it must be accepted that the plea was not one attributable to a genuine consciousness of guilt.” 
        
       
      
    30 His Honour then considered the suggested forms of challenge to the prosecution witnesses and concluded that, whilst the prosecution case appeared to be relatively strong, it could not be said that “questions of the kind mentioned could not genuinely arise which should be determined by a jury”: at [46]. His Honour continued at [47]: 
     
      
       
        
        “This Court should, in my view, be reluctant to dismiss the confession by an experienced public defender that he made a mistake in his assessment of the merits of the case and in the advice given.” 
        
       
      
    The conviction was set aside and a new trial ordered. 
     
      
    31 More recently this Court upheld an appeal against conviction based on a plea of guilty in circumstances where the appellant pleaded on the basis of advice which was legally erroneous: R v Hawker [2005] NSWCCA 118 (Grove, Howie and Hall JJ). The Court was also referred to Regina v Almirol [2006] NSWSC 898 (James J) in which an application for leave to withdraw a plea was granted, despite the accused receiving proper advice from a solicitor, in the case of an accused who was from the Philippines, whose mother tongue was not English and who was not familiar with the legal system in New South Wales and in respect of a charge of murder as to which he had consistently maintained his innocence of involvement in the actual killing and where the basis of the plea was that “by [his] presence, words and encouragement” he had assisted the man who killed the deceased. Both of these cases turned on their own facts, rather than on any issue of principle. 
     
      
       
      Application of principles 
      
    32 On the appeal, Mr Game SC focused in the evidence of Mr Gelbert and in the statement of instructions which he prepared for the applicant to sign, upon references to a defence of honest and reasonable mistake of fact. Thus, in the instructions the following passage appeared: 
     
      
       
        
        “I acknowledge that that statement and the evidence of that witness would have been damning for any defence I proposed to mount about an honest belief that I had the right to alter the forms as I did.” 
        
       
      
    33 To similar effect, in his affidavit, Mr Gelbert had stated that in conference on 3 April: 
     
      
       
        
        “I explained to Mr Norvenska that I thought that this material was potentially damaging and could well serve to suggest that he had [been] put on notice for such improper alterations and that such warning by Ms Hamill [sic] had been ignored. Mr Norvenska in previous instructions had admitted to me that he had solely made out all alterations and accordingly this prior warning would serve to eliminate any defence of honest and reasonable mistake in relation to his present trial.” 
        
       
      
    This language was, as Mr Game contended, reminiscent of the defence discussed in Proudman v Dayman (1941) 67 CLR 536, as an exculpatory defence to a statutory offence which did not require a specific state of mind as an ingredient of the offence. Such an approach would have been inappropriate in this case, as it was necessary for the prosecution to establish that the applicant had intentionally created a situation in which the Commonwealth was deprived of its money in circumstances where the applicant knew that he had no entitlement to claim that money: see Peters v The Queen (1998) 192 CLR 493 at [30] (Toohey and Gaudron JJ), quoted with approval in Macleod v The Queen (2003) 214 CLR 230 at [35]. 
     
      
    34 It was also suggested that, unless Mr Gelbert had misunderstood and misexplained the relevant elements of the offence in this way, he would not have thought the evidence of Ms Hammill to have great significance. He referred to the passage in Mr Gelbert’s evidence where he explained that matter in answer to a question from the trial judge (Tcpt, 20/10/06, p 6): 
     
      
       
        
        “HIS HONOUR: And his defence is … that he was doing what he thought he was … entitled to because he was just fixing up a situation where incompetent doctors weren’t charging properly for the amount of time they were spending? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Well more so your Honour, he … was proposing to present before the jury that he felt that he had the authority to make the alterations. That was his honest and reasonable belief, whereas apparently the way in which [Hammill] became involved in … the first investigation was that there was supposedly some complaint made by a doctor at the same practice about alterations.” 
        
       
      
    35 At the heart of this contention is the proposition that Mr Gelbert had given advice on the basis of a fundamental error as to the nature of the elements of the charge. An alternative view is that he was seeking to describe, as a practical matter, how the jury would be likely to view the evidence and what they might infer from the evidence likely to have been presented, as to the applicant’s state of mind. The question for the jury would have been whether the conduct of the applicant “was dishonest according to ordinary notions” which are to be decided “by the standards of ordinary, decent people”: Peters, 192 CLR 493 at [18]. The indictment pleaded defrauding Medicare “by dishonest means”. The dishonesty was said to lie in the seeking of benefits in the names of medical practitioners “who did not claim those benefits”. There was evidence that at least one doctor had not claimed such benefits and had not intended to. Ms Hammill’s evidence would suggest that the applicant was aware of that fact and yet continued to make alterations to the Medicare forms for several months after being made aware of that circumstance. There was also evidence of a memorandum circulated by the applicant to the practitioners headed “Future Survival Procedures in the Bulk-Billing Medical Industry”. It set out the financial problem faced by the practice which, it was said, “simply revolves around the basic fact that the income per session per hour is too small”. 
     
      
    36 Further, the relevant context included the fact that his solicitor, Mr Gregory Meakin, had had “numerous conferences, telephone discussions and meetings with [the applicant] and with his previous pro bono counsel, Ms Elizabeth Cohen”: Affidavit, 18 August 2006. Mr Meakin also noted: 
     
      
       
        
        “There was a particular conference in my office which lasted for some hours well prior to Counsel being briefed when the ‘defence’ was discussed. All aspects of my client’s instructions were examined in the course of that conference and I formed a view generally as to the prospects of success and the difficulties of the matter particularly – ‘the defence’. 
        
       
      
    37 Although Mr Gelbert was not the first counsel briefed in the matter he stated in his affidavit that he had been briefed ‘approximately two weeks’ before the commencement of the trial on 27 March 2006 and had ‘had numerous conferences with’ the applicant. Mr Meakin also gave evidence, on which he was not cross-examined, that at the time the plea was being considered, on the morning of 3 April, the following exchange occurred during his telephone conversation with the applicant: 
     
      
       
        
        “I recall that I said words to the effect: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘Peter, you only plead guilty if you accept your [sic] guilty of all the elements of the charge or charges’. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        He said words to the effect:- 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘Yes thank you. I understand.’ 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        Throughout the course of this conversation I did not detect any stress or unusual emotion in Mr Norvenska’s voice.” 
        
       
      
    38 This material gives some context and content to the statement in the signed instructions that the applicant felt he was “justified” in doing what he did, but that he realised that his actions were “dishonest” in that he was “unable to justify the particular entitlement” the subject of the charge. This statement was in accordance with the elements of the charge and, to the extent that he said he signed the document without understanding it or because of pressure applied by his barrister, the trial judge rejected his evidence. It follows that, however the mental element may have been expressed in the evidence, it was a reasonable encapsulation in a phrase of what, as a factual matter, the evidence of the applicant would have had to establish. It said nothing about the legal test or the onus of proof. It was adequately acknowledged by the applicant in writing in appropriate terms, which both explained and justified the plea of guilty. 
     
      
    39 In these circumstances, the applicant has not established that he was ignorant of the elements of the offence nor that Mr Gelbert advised him on a mistaken basis as to the law. In truth, the legal elements were few and straightforward and guilt or innocence would have turned at a trial on the jury’s appreciation of the facts, and particularly the applicant’s state of mind. It has not been established that his Honour was in error in concluding that the applicant made a choice after receiving “appropriate advice” and that he was given “properly considered legal advice” by his lawyers, who “satisfied themselves that he understood this advice”. Accordingly, his Honour did not err in declining to grant leave to withdraw the plea of guilty. 
     
      
    40 The applicant should be granted an extension of time for a further 28 days so that the application was filed in a timely fashion. The applicant should be granted leave under s 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act. However, the appeal should be dismissed.

     R (Cth) v Michael John POYNDER 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 JAMES J: This is an appeal by the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions pursuant to s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act against sentences imposed on the respondent Michael John Poynder by his Honour Judge Norrish in the District Court on 7 December 2006. For each of two offences under s 474.26 of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth) (“the Criminal Code”), to which the respondent had pleaded guilty, Judge Norrish imposed a sentence of imprisonment for three years commencing on 15 June 2006, the date on which the respondent had been taken into custody, and made a recognizance release order that the respondent be released at the expiration of one year three months of the term of imprisonment, that is on 14 September 2007, upon his entering into a recognizance, subject to conditions including that the respondent be of good behaviour for a period of three years from that date and accept the supervision and guidance of officers of the New South Wales Probation and Parole Service for a period of two years after his release. In sentencing the respondent Judge Norrish took into account, pursuant to s 16BA of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth), two offences under s 474.17 of the Criminal Code.  
     
      
    2 Part 10.6 of the Criminal Code — “telecommunication services” was inserted in the Criminal Code by Act 127 of 2004 and came into effect on 1 March 2005.  
     
      
    3 Section 474.26(1) of Pt 10.6 of the Criminal Code provides:- 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) A person (the sender 
          
        ) commits an offence if:  
        
       
       
        
        (a) the sender uses a carriage service to transmit a communication to another person (the recipient 
          
        ); and  
         
        (b) the sender does this with the intention of procuring the recipient to engage in, or submit to, sexual activity with the sender; and  
         
        (c) the recipient is someone who is, or who the sender believes to be, under 16 years of age; and  
         
        (d) the sender is at least 18 years of age.  
         
         
        Penalty: Imprisonment for 15 years. “ 
        
       
      
    4 Section 474.17 in Pt 10.6 of the Criminal Code provides, so far as is relevant:- 
     
      
       
        
        “A person is guilty of an offence if: 
        
       
       
        
        a) a person uses a carriage service; and  
        
       
       
        
        b) a person does so in a way (whether by the method of use were the content of a communication, or both) that reasonable persons would regard as being, in all the circumstances,…offensive. 
        
       
       
        
        Penalty: Imprisonment for 3 years” 
        
       
      
    5 The maximum penalty under s 85ZE of the Crimes Act, which was in somewhat similar terms to, and was replaced by, s 474.17 of the Criminal Code, was imprisonment for 12 months.  
     
      
    6 It was common ground in the proceedings on sentence and on this appeal that, for the purposes of the Criminal Code, “carriage service” includes a telephone service. 
     
      
    7 The Crown appeal against the sentences imposed by Judge Norrish was brought on 22 December 2006. A notice of an application by the respondent for leave to appeal against the sentences was filed but was not proceeded with.  
     
      
       
      Facts of the offences 
       
      
    8 A lengthy statement of the facts of the offences was admitted, without objection, in the proceedings on sentence and formed the basis of Judge Norrish’s statement of the facts of the offences in his remarks on sentence. In the Crown’s written submissions on this appeal it was accepted by the Crown that the facts of the offences (and also the circumstances of the respondent) were accurately and fully summarised by his Honour in his remarks on sentence. 
     
      
    9 I will now set out Judge Norrish’s statement of the facts of the two offences under s 474.26. The parts of the statement which I have placed in brackets do not appear in the statement of facts which was an exhibit in the proceedings on sentence and are comments added by Judge Norrish. 
     
      
       
        
        “A strike force was formed in April 2006 to investigate an allegation by a female informant, who was a prostitute, that the prisoner was intending to commit sexual assaults upon children. The woman told police she met the prisoner when he attended a massage parlour as a client. He discussed with her committing sexual acts on young girls and left his mobile phone number with her for her to make further contact with him. The woman was disturbed by this conversation and contacted the police, [which is much to her credit]. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Subsequently a listening device was attached to her whilst she conducted conversations with the prisoner and telephone intercept warrants were obtained in relation to two telephone services used by him, his mobile number supplied by his employer and his home phone number. [It should be fairly said as the facts reveal that many of the conversations he had with the woman were not directed at matters that he intended to complete or perform, but were conducted by him for the purposes of his own sexual gratification.] 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        On 10 May 2006 the female informant in the presence of police telephoned the prisoner on his mobile phone and spoke to him and made arrangements to meet him at a cafe. On 11 May 2006 a meeting took place between the informant, wearing the listening device, and the prisoner. On this occasion the prisoner spoke about the idea of the two of them raping an eleven year old girl whose mother he had met. He also spoke of having raped another child. An arrangement was made for further contact. [There is no evidence that he had in fact raped a child or that he in fact intended raping an eleven year old child, the daughter of a woman that he knew.] 
         
         
        [Certainly the Court could not be satisfied of these matters on the available evidence, however it is clear as I said earlier that these conversations were for his deviant sexual satisfaction.] 
         
         
        On 16 May 2006 the female informant telephoned him on his mobile phone and this phone was recorded. Police investigations have revealed that the prisoner had made numerous phone calls to phone chat services in which he left recorded messages expressing a desire to have sex with children and animals. [He did this for his sexual gratification.] He also entered into live conversations with children and adults regarding these topics, [again for his sexual gratification] and these calls were recorded.  
         
         
        In relation to the first charge in time to which he pleaded guilty, the facts are that the prisoner contacted the Hot Gozzip Chat Service and spoke with a male person who the prisoner believed was under sixteen years of age for the purpose of initiating sexual activity with him. On two occasions the male person told the prisoner that he was fifteen years of age. The prisoner entered into sexual discussions with this person stating things such as, ""Hi, how are you, do you have a nice hard cock"", ""How old are you?"" and, ""I like young boys"". 
         
         
        The male person stated that he liked older men. The prisoner asked if he had ever been ""fucked by older men"" and stated that he ""loves little boys"". The prisoner obtained an address and a phone number from this person and arranged to meet him for sex at the male person's address. The prisoner immediately tried to call the male on the number supplied, however the prisoner had taken down the number incorrectly. The number given by the male was later found to be a disconnected number. [There is no evidence as to whether the male was in fact under sixteen, or not, but the prisoner believed him so to be.] 
         
         
        In relation to the second charge in time to which he pleaded guilty, again the prisoner contacted the same chat service on 15 June 2006 but on this occasion he spoke with a female undercover police operative conducting an operation. She introduced herself and said she was fifteen and wanted to have a talk. The prisoner sent the police operative a message stating that he was willing to pay her $100 if she performed fellatio upon him and $200 [for what I understand to be penile penetration of her vagina.] 
         
         
        After a number of voice messages were received, the undercover police officer stated that she had not performed fellatio before. She told the prisoner again she was fifteen but would only meet when her mother had left for work. She provided the prisoner with a mobile phone number stating the prisoner could call her in about twenty minutes after her mother left for work and twenty minutes later the prisoner called her and entered into further sexual conversations and arranged to meet her at an address in Redfern He told the undercover police operative during this period of time that his name was ""David"" and that he was from Surry Hills. He also asked questions about when the mother would be home. During other intercepted phone calls when the prisoner had arranged to meet adults for sex, he freely gave his true personal details but on this occasion he did not. 
         
         
        He was observed by police to go to the address given by the undercover police operative. He rang the intercom of the address given by the operative, and then rang her on the mobile phone asking where she was. It was at this point he was arrested by detectives attached to what I understand to be a New South Wales Police Service squad and he was taken to the Redfern Police Station. He was found to have in his possession condoms, lubricant and the sum of $236. He also had the address supplied by the operative written down on a piece of paper. He was transferred to the Surry Hills Police Station where he was interviewed. He declined to participate in an interview, as was his right, and he was charged. A search warrant was executed on his home address and a number of items were located.” 
        
       
      
    10 The first offence which was taken into account in the sentencing of the respondent was an offence committed by the respondent on 16 May 2006 in a telephone conversation with the female informant, which was intercepted by police. Judge Norrish in his remarks on sentence rejected some aspects of an account of this conversation by the respondent recorded in a report by a psychiatrist Dr Stephen Allnutt of 30 November 2006. Contrary to what was recorded in Dr Allnutt’s report, Judge Norrish found that there was no suggestion in the conversation of entrapment of the respondent by the informant and that the bulk of the offensive contents of the conversation came from the respondent. Judge Norrish summarised the contents of part of this conversation by saying:- 
     
      
       
        
        “The prisoner discussed with the woman the planning and preparation of the rape of a young child aged five. The prisoner indicated that he had organised a baby sitting job for a five year old girl that night, however the job had fallen through and he would organise a further baby sitting job where, as with the initial plan as discussed with the prostitute, he would tie the mother up and beat her whilst the five year old child was raped.” 
        
       
      
    11 Judge Norrish proceeded to comment:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Of course there is no evidence that the prisoner knew of such persons and it would appear on the evidence available to me I must accept that these conversations were fantasy on the part of the prisoner for his own sexual gratification.” 
        
       
      
    12 Judge Norrish added:- 
     
      
       
        
        “The detail however of the conversation is very disturbing indeed, even if it is an expression of flights of fancy rather than real situations proposed by the prisoner to the prostitute.” 
        
       
      
    13 The second offence which was taken into account in sentencing the respondent consisted of the making by the respondent of a number of telephone calls to the telephone Chat Service. In his remarks on sentence Judge Norrish said, with respect to this second offence to be taken into account:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Police covertly recorded approximately 540 calls on the land line of the accused to that particular service during the seventeen or eighteen day period disclosed in the charge. In these conversations the prisoner talked about sex with children, incest, bestiality, offering money for various forms of sex with children and boasting to his audience in a chat room at large that he was into “wild taboo things such as sex with children, incest, rape, animals” amongst other matters. He made other indecent suggestions to persons who he believed were children with whom he was communicating, both male and female. During some of these conversations he claimed to have had sex with his daughter and sex with his dog named “Rex”. He had neither a daughter nor a dog.” 
        
       
      
    14 His Honour commented about the telephone calls the subject of the second offence to be taken into account that they would be “greatly offensive to ordinary decent people and were the more offensive, if one took into account the age of the respondent and his belief that most of the persons he was speaking to would be under the age of 18 years”.  
     
      
    15 His Honour concluded that the additional offences demonstrated that the respondent’s actions in committing the principal offences were not spontaneous or impulsive.  
     
      
    16 After stating the facts of both the principal offences and the additional offences his Honour said that the commission to the principal offences, unlike the commission of the additional offences, went beyond expressions of fantasy for sexual gratification. In committing the principal offences the respondent had used a carriage service with the intention of actually procuring a person who he believed to be under 16 years of age to engage in sexual activity with him.  
     
      
       
      Subjective circumstances of the respondent 
       
      
    17 The respondent did not himself give evidence in the proceedings on sentence. There was, however, a considerable amount of evidence about the respondent before the sentencing judge, including the report by Dr Allnutt and long letters or statements from a Tasmanian legal practitioner, who is a senior counsel; a partner in a large Sydney firm of solicitors; one of the respondent’s brothers; and the respondent’s former wife.  
     
      
    18 The respondent was born in August 1955 in Tasmania and was accordingly 50 years old at the time of committing the offences.  
     
      
    19 He attended the University of Tasmania and graduated in law shortly before 1980. He worked for a Tasmanian legal firm from 1980 to 1992, being a partner from 1985 onwards. Judge Norrish found that while the respondent was a legal practitioner in Tasmania, he had “applied himself energetically and ethically to his work”. 
     
      
    20 In 1992 the respondent left the Tasmanian firm, of his own volition. He went to New York for a year. After his return from New York, he went to Sydney, where he obtained employment as a solicitor. In Sydney the respondent met a woman with whom he entered into a relationship and whom in about 1995 he married. The respondent and his wife separated in 2001 and early in 2006 the marriage was formally dissolved. Notwithstanding the breakdown of the marriage, the respondent’s former wife has visited him in prison and she wrote a letter to the sentencing judge supportive of the respondent.  
     
      
    21 In 1995 the respondent obtained employment as a solicitor with a large Sydney firm of solicitors. He progressively held positions as a solicitor, a senior associate and as a “special counsel”, although he did not succeed in becoming a partner. He was diligent, hard working and well regarded. While working for the firm, he prepared, on his own initiative, a proposal for indigenous law students to obtain work experience and part-time employment with the firm. After he was arrested, the respondent resigned his position with the firm and wrote a letter to the firm apologising for any embarrassment he had caused the firm.  
     
      
    22 In July 2006 the Legal Services Commissioner initiated complaints against the respondent, in accordance with the Legal Profession Act, that by reason of the conduct with which he had been charged, he was not of good fame and character, was not a fit and proper person to hold a practicing certificate and had brought the legal profession into disrepute. Judge Norrish sentenced the respondent on the basis that these complaints would be pursued and that the respondent would be found not to be a fit and proper person to hold a practicing certificate.  
     
      
    23 Judge Norrish found that in all the material about the respondent’s background from persons who had known him “he has never been observed to conduct himself in an inappropriate way towards friends, professional colleagues, family or children”. However, Judge Norrish found that the respondent was “truly a Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde character” and that “the dark side of the prisoner’s personality was…never shown to those close to him”. 24 The respondent had no previous criminal convictions of any sort.  
     
      
       
      Further parts of the remarks on sentence 
       
      
    25 In further parts of the remarks on sentence the sentencing judge dealt with various matters.  
     
      
    26 His Honour stated that the principal offences were serious, both by reason of their character and by reason of the maximum penalty prescribed. 
     
      
    27 His Honour observed that “issues of general deterrence and personal deterrence loomed large in the sentencing exercise to ensure that persons who engage in this conduct are made an example of to others and to try and prevent further corruption of children and to ensure that the prisoner is prevented and/or deterred from such conduct or even considering such conduct in the future”. 
     
      
    28 His Honour was mindful of the need in sentencing the respondent to comply with the relevant provisions of the Crimes Act, including s 16BA. In taking the additional offences into account in sentencing the respondent for the principal offences, it was necessary to comply with the principles in Attorney General’s Application Under S 37 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (No 1 of 2002) (2002) 56 NSWLR 146. On this appeal it was common ground that those principles applied in the sentencing of Commonwealth offenders.  
     
      
    29 His Honour found that the respondent’s pleas of guilty had been entered at the first reasonable opportunity and that the respondent should receive a discount in penalty of 25 per cent for the utilitarian benefit of those pleas. On this appeal it was not contended by the Crown that it had been inappropriate for his Honour to allow this discount.  
     
      
    30 His Honour found that the respondent had for many years had a sexual addiction, seeking sexual stimulation in a number of ways, including fantasising about taboo sexual conduct, in which he in fact did not participate, and having paid sex with prostitutes. 
     
      
    31 Although his Honour found that some of the history the respondent had given Dr Allnutt was inaccurate, his Honour accepted an opinion formed by Dr Allnutt that the respondent fell within the moderate low risk group for sexual recidivism in the general population and “taking his age into account under statistically validated predictive instruments he falls into the low risk group”. Dr Allnutt considered that the risks of future offending would be lower with appropriate treatment and that there was a high probability that the respondent would apply himself to future treatment programs. The sentencing judge found that the respondent was not now ashamed or unwilling to seek professional assistance and had the self-awareness and intellectual capacity to benefit from professional assistance. The respondent had in fact entered into treatment programs since he was taken into custody. 
     
      
    32 His Honour found special circumstances in the respondent’s need for help after his release in adjusting to living in the community and for an extended period of supervision including counselling and treatment.  
     
      
       
      The Crown’s submissions on the appeal 
       
      
    33 The principal submissions made by the Crown on this appeal can be summarised as follows.  
     
      
    34 It was conceded by the Crown that the facts of the offences and the subjective circumstances of the respondent were accurately and fully summarised in the sentencing judge’s remarks on sentence. It was also conceded by the Crown that the sentencing judge in his remarks on sentence had properly referred to all relevant sentencing considerations. However, it was submitted that the sentences imposed by the sentencing judge were manifestly inadequate, having regard to the objective facts of the offences as found by the sentencing judge and the high maximum penalty of imprisonment for 15 years set by the legislature for an offence under s 474.26 of the Criminal Code. The seriousness of the offence was to be measured by taking into account the objective facts of the offences, the maximum penalty under s 474.26 and by determining where the instant offences lay within the range of conduct coming within the section.  
     
      
    35 It was submitted that the facts of the offences fell squarely within the statutory provision. Aggravating factors were that in the case of both principal offences, and particularly in the case of the second offence, the respondent had taken steps to carry out his intention to procure the recipient of the communication to engage in sexual activity with him. The offer of payment for sexual services was also a factor aggravating the second offence.  
     
      
    36 Counsel referred to the Second Reading Speech made by the responsible Minister, when introducing the Bill which inserted Pt 10.6 into the Criminal Code. The Minister said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “The Bill contains new offences dealing with use of the Internet to access, transmit and make available child pornography and child abuse material, as well as possession or production of such material with intent to place it on the Internet…The new offences will also prohibit the use of a telecommunications service, including by means of the Internet, to procure or ‘groom’ a person who is under 16 years of age, for the purpose of engaging in sexual activity with that person or so that a third person can engage in sexual activity with that person. These offences carry penalties of 12-15 years imprisonment.  
        
       
       
        
        These new offences target adult offenders who exploit the anonymity of telecommunications services (for example, a ‘chat room’ on the Internet) to win the trust of a child as a first step towards the future sexual abuse of that child. This abhorrent practice is known as ‘online grooming’.  
        
       
       
        
        The new ‘procurement’ offences will also target situations where an offender, having won a child’s trust, then uses a telecommunications service to orchestrate a meeting with the child so as to engage in sexual activity. 
        
       
       
        
        These new offences would provide a firm legal basis for proactive AFP policing of this disturbing practice. The underlying rationale for the new offences is to allow law enforcement to intervene before a child is actually abused. A typical investigation may involve an AFP officer, or investigator at the Australian High Tech Crime Centre, assuming the identity of a fictitious child, interacting with potential predatory adults over the Internet, and arresting a predatory adult before they have an opportunity to sexually abuse a real child that they are also ‘grooming’.” 
        
       
      
    37 Counsel also referred to parts of the explanatory memorandum for the Bill.  
     
      
    38 It was pointed out that in sentencing the respondent for the principal offences the sentencing judge had to take into account the additional offences.  
     
      
    39 It was submitted that, although the sentencing judge in his remarks on sentence had referred to the purposes of sentencing of deterrence and denunciation, the sentences imposed by the sentencing judge did not sufficiently fulfil these purposes.  
     
      
    40 Counsel for the Crown referred to a series of Queensland Court of Appeal decisions on appeals against sentences for offences under s 218A(1)(a) of the Queensland Criminal Code, which was in fairly similar terms to s 474.26 of the Criminal Code.  
     
      
    41 Counsel also referred to the only previous decision in which a sentence has been imposed for an offence under s 474.26 of the Criminal Code R v Meehan 21 July 2006 (2007) VCC (Victorian County Court), a decision of Judge Douglas of the Victorian County Court. 
     
      
    42 Counsel also referred to a sentencing decision R v Holmes NSW District Court (Williams DCJ) 19 May 2006.  
     
      
    43 I will consider the decisions on s 218A(1)(a) of the Queensland Criminal Code and the cases of Meehan and Holmes later in this judgment.  
     
      
       
      The Respondent’s submissions on the appeal 
       
      
    44 The principal submissions made by counsel for the respondent can be summarised as follows.  
     
      
    45 Although the principal offences were serious, there were some matters which, at least to some extent, reduced their objective seriousness and distinguished the instant cases from worse cases.  
     
      
    46 As to the first offence, there had been communication by the respondent on one day only with a male person, who said that he was 15 years old. Although the respondent had believed that the person was under 16 years of age, there was no evidence that the person was in fact under 16 years of age. The person had given the respondent a telephone number, which was in fact a disconnected telephone number.  
     
      
    47 As to the second offence, there had been communication by the respondent on one day only with someone who, although believed by the respondent to be a girl of 15, was in fact an adult police officer. The Crown in para 16 of its written submissions conceded that remarks by the Queensland Court of Appeal on appeals against sentences for offences under s 218A(1)(a) of the Queensland Criminal Code, that it was relevant to sentencing that no real child victim was involved, were “apposite” to sentencing for an offence under s 474.26 of the Criminal Code.  
     
      
    48 In both of the offences the respondent had believed that the person he was communicating with was 15 years old. In the Queensland cases the offender had believed that the person he was communicating with was younger.  
     
      
    49 In neither of the offences had there been a process of online “grooming” of a child over a period, which according to the Second Reading Speech and the explanatory memorandum was a practice particularly aimed at by the legislation. 
     
      
    50 As to the additional offences, the sentencing judge had found that in making the calls the respondent was engaging in fantasising, not having done the things he described and not having any intention of doing them.  
     
      
    51 As to the first of the additional offences, the person with whom the respondent was communicating, the informant, was an adult woman whom the respondent had met and with whom the respondent had had consensual sexual relations. 
     
      
    52 The maximum penalty for an offence under s 474.26 was a yardstick in sentencing but had to be balanced with all the other relevant factors. Counsel referred to Markarian v The Queen (2005) 79 ALJR 1048 at 1056 [31]. 
     
      
    53 Counsel referred to favourable subjective features of the respondent, including his pleas of guilty, his contrition and his employment history.  
     
      
    54 The sentencing judge, after carefully considering Dr Allnutt’s report, had accepted Dr Allnutt’s opinion that the respondent fell within the moderate low risk group for sexual recidivism in the general population and, after the respondent’s age was taken into account, within the low risk group.  
     
      
    55 The respondent had suffered severe extra-curial punishment for his offending in the loss of his profession and livelihood. Some allowance could be made in sentencing the respondent for the public humiliation he had undergone.  
     
      
    56 In the Queensland cases referred to by the Crown non-custodial sentences or custodial sentences with only a short period to be actually served in prison had been imposed and, notwithstanding the lower maximum penalty under s 218A(1)(a) of the Queensland Criminal Code, the Queensland cases provided some guidance in the present case.  
     
      
    57 Counsel referred to principles governing appeals against sentence generally and, particularly, principles governing Crown appeals against sentence. 
     
      
       
      Other sentencing decisions 
       
      
    58 As I noted earlier in this judgment counsel for the Crown referred to a series of Queensland Court of Appeal decisions on appeals against sentences for offences under s 218A(1)(a) of the Queensland Criminal Code.  
     
      
    59 Section 218A(1)(a) of the Queensland Criminal Code made it an offence to use the internet to procure a person believed to be under 16 years of age to engage in a sexual act. It was, accordingly, substantially similar to s 474.26 of the Criminal Code. Counsel for the Crown suggested that, although s 218A(1)(a) has not been expressly repealed, it is no longer in effect since the Commonwealth provision came into force. 
     
      
    60 The maximum penalty for an offence under s 218A(1)(a) was imprisonment for 5 years, or for 10 years, if the person communicated with was under 12 years of age or the offender believed that the person was under 12 years of age. The maximum penalty, therefore, was considerably less than the maximum penalty under s 474.26 of the Criminal Code. 
     
      
    61 In R v Kennings [2004] QCA 162 the Queensland Court of Appeal allowed the offender’s appeal against sentence and re-sentenced the offender to imprisonment for 18 months, but suspended the sentence. The offender had communicated over three days with an adult police officer pretending to be a 13 year old girl.  
     
      
    62 In R v Campbell [2004] QCA 342 the Queensland Court of Appeal dismissed an offender’s appeal against a sentence of imprisonment for 18 months, suspended after serving three months. The offender had communicated on five occasions with an adult police officer pretending to be a 13 year old girl. 
     
      
    63 In R v Burdon [2005] QCA 147, [2005] 153 A Crim R 104 the Queensland Court of Appeal dismissed a Crown appeal against a sentence of imprisonment for 18 months, which was wholly suspended. As in the other Queensland cases, the offender had communicated with an adult police officer who pretended to be a 13 year old girl. The offender had spoken in sexual terms and had sent sexually explicit photographs. In dismissing the Crown appeal the Court took into account the delays which had occurred in the Court proceedings and the extent to which the offender had been shamed in his local community through media interest. 
     
      
    64 In R v McGrath [2005] QCA 463 the offender appealed against sentences for a number of offences, including two offences under s 218A(1)(a) of the Queensland Criminal Code. The offender had communicated with two persons who he believed to be 13 years old but were in fact adult police officers. The Court of Appeal allowed the offender’s appeal against those sentences and ordered that the sentences of four months imprisonment imposed by the sentencing judge be suspended after six days. 
     
      
    65 In R v Hayes [2006] QCA 20 the Court of Appeal dismissed an offender’s appeal against sentences for two offences under s 218A(1)(a) of imprisonment for 18 months, suspended after three months. On each occasion the offender had communicated with the same adult police officer pretending to be a 13 year old girl. 
     
      
    66 In the present appeal the Crown did not accept that the sentences in the Queensland cases were, necessarily, appropriate sentences under the Queensland Criminal Code. It was submitted that, in any event, “the sentences imposed in the Queensland cases are not indicative of what the appropriate range of sentences for an offence against s 474.26 should be, mainly because of the significantly lower maximum penalty under the Queensland Criminal Code”. 
     
      
    67 It is clear that, in considering the Queensland decisions, the much greater penalty under the Commonwealth Criminal Code must be borne in mind. Nevertheless, it is noteworthy that the sentences imposed were much less than the sentences imposed in the present case by Judge Norrish and, where a sentence of imprisonment was imposed, the sentence was wholly or very largely suspended. 
     
      
    68 As noted earlier in this judgment, the only previous decision in which a sentence has been imposed for an offence under s 474.26 of the Criminal Code is R v Meehan 21 July 2006 (2007) VCC. 
     
      
    69 The facts in Meehan were very different from the facts in the present case. Over a period of about two months the offender, who lived in Melbourne, communicated, not with an undercover police officer, but with a girl living in Canberra who turned 15 during the period of the communication. The offender was seeking to foster what was described as a “romantic sexual relationship”. The offender and the girl had a meeting in Canberra. The girl’s mother became suspicious and the offender was apprehended. The offender had generally favourable subjective circumstances. 
     
      
    70 The offender was sentenced to imprisonment for two years but to be released after serving three months upon entering into a recognizance.  
     
      
    71 No appeal was brought, either by the offender or by the Crown, against the sentence imposed by the sentencing judge. However, on this appeal counsel for the Crown said that the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions regarded the sentence as inadequate. 
     
      
    72 Counsel for the Crown also referred to R v Holmes. Holmes was sentenced, not for any offence under s 474.26 of the Criminal Code, but for a number of other offences, including an offence of using a carriage service to “groom” a person under 16 years of age, an offence under s 474.27 of the Criminal Code. 
     
      
    73 Under s 474.27 it is an offence to use a carriage service to transmit a communication to another person which is indecent, with the intention of making it easier to procure the recipient to engage in sexual activity with the sender, where the recipient is or is believed by the sender to be under 16 years of age and the sender is at least 18 years of age. The maximum penalty for the offence is imprisonment for 12 years.  
     
      
    74 The sentence imposed by the District Court judge for the offence of grooming, to which Holmes had pleaded guilty, was a term of imprisonment of two years nine months, with a non-parole period of one year eight months. 
     
      
    75 Holmes had communicated with a person in the United Kingdom, who purported to be an 11 year old girl “Lucy” but who was in fact an adult male, who, according to the sentencing judge’s remarks on sentence, was being investigated by authorities in the United Kingdom.  
     
      
    76 Holmes transmitted images of child pornography, suggesting that the recipient could do similar things with him. Holmes, who was a flight attendant for an airline, proposed a meeting in London for sexual activity, including anal sex. Holmes said that if “Lucy” became pregnant and gave birth, the child could be tied up and subjected to obscene criminal acts.  
     
      
        
      
    77 Holmes was also sentenced for offences of possession of child pornography, using a carriage service to transmit child pornography and importing child pornography. 
     
      
    78 No appeal was brought by either the offender or the Crown from the sentences imposed in the District Court. On the present appeal counsel for the Crown said that the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions regarded the sentences as inadequate. 
     
      
       
      General principles on Crown appeals against sentences 
       
      
    79 The principles to be applied on Crown appeals against sentence are set out in para 70 of the judgment of Wood CJ at CL in R v Wall [2002] NSWCCA 42. His Honour said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “(a) The normal restriction upon appellate review of the exercise of a discretion, as set out in House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 499, applies to Crown appeals against sentence: Dinsdale v The Queen (2000) 202 CLR 321; with the result that this Court cannot merely substitute its opinion, as to the appropriate sentence, for that of the sentencing judge: Lowndes v The Queen (1999) 195 CLR 665 at 671; rather, it may interfere only where error either latent or patent is shown; R v Tait (1979) 46 FLR 386 at 388; and Wong and Leung v The Queen (2001) 76 ALJR 79 at para58 and para109. 
         
         
        (b) Appeals by the Crown should generally be rare; Malvaso v The Queen (1989) 168 CLR 227 at 234, and unless there is a clear error of principle identified, it would be exceptional for the Court to interfere: R v Baker [2000] NSWCCA 85. 
         
         
        (c) A Crown appeal against sentence is concerned with establishing matters of principle ""for the governance and guidance of courts having the duty of sentencing convicted persons"": per Barwick CJ in Griffiths v The Queen (1977) 137 CLR 293 but this power extends to doing what is necessary to avoid manifest inadequacy or inconsistency in sentencing, that is, where the sentence is definitely outside the appropriate range for the case in hand: Everett v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 295 at 299; Dinsdale v The Queen (2000) 202 CLR 32, at para61 and para62, and Wong & Leung v The Queen at para109. 
         
         
        (d) The Court has a lively discretion to refuse to intervene even if error has been shown, and in deciding whether to exercise that discretion, it should have regard to the double jeopardy that a convicted person faces as a result of a Crown appeal: R v Allpass (1993) 72 A Crim R 561, R v Papazis (1991) 51 A Crim R 242 at 247, and Wong and Leung v The Queen at para110. 
         
         
        (e) A sentence which is imposed as a consequence of a successful Crown appeal will generally be less than that which should have been imposed by the sentencing court: R v Holder and Johnston (1983) 3 NSWLR 245 at 256, and will generally be towards the lower end of the available range of sentence: Dinsdale v The Queen at para62.” 
         
        
       
      
    80 In para (b) Wood CJ at CL referred to R v Baker, in which Spigelman CJ said at paras [12] and [19]:- 
     
      
       
        
        “[12] This is one of those cases in which the Court is asked to infer a legal error from the mere inadequacy of the sentence. The Appellant's submissions did not direct attention to any part of the conduct of the proceedings, or of her Honour's reasons on sentence, which disclosed any form of legal error. 
        
       
       
        
        [19] 
          
        In my opinion there is no warrant for this Court to interfere with the sentencing discretion by her Honour. The authorities make it clear that Crown appeals should be rare. It may be that present practice does not reflect that restriction, nevertheless, successful Crown appeals should be rare. This is particularly so with respect to that category of appeals in which no particular error can be identified in the sentencing process and the Crown must rely on an assertion of manifest inadequacy as a basis for a conclusion that some error of principle must have occurred.” 
         
        
       
       
      Decision 
       
      
    81 As already stated earlier in this judgment, it was conceded by counsel for the Crown on this appeal that the facts of the offences and the subjective circumstances of the respondent were accurately and fully set forth in the sentencing judge’s remarks on sentence and it was further conceded by the Crown that the sentencing judge in his remarks on sentence had properly referred to all sentencing considerations. His Honour referred appropriately in his remarks on sentence to all the purposes of sentencing, including deterrence and denunciation.  
     
      
    82 In such circumstances, in accordance with the principles stated in Baker and Wall, a successful Crown appeal will be rare. In order for the Crown to succeed on an appeal, the Crown is required to show that legal error can be inferred merely from the length of the sentence. Legal error must be established, not merely that this Court, if it had been the original sentencing court, might or would have imposed a longer sentence. 
     
      
    83 The offences committed by the respondent were objectively serious. However, the objective seriousness of the respondent’s offences could be distinguished from the objective seriousness of more serious cases, in the way stated by the sentencing judge in his remarks on sentence which I have summarised earlier in this judgment and in the ways submitted by counsel for the respondent in his submissions which I have also summarised earlier in this judgment. 
     
      
    84 Counsel for the Crown relied particularly on the high maximum penalty for an offence under s 474.26 of the Criminal Code. The maximum penalty for an offence is a yardstick and an important yardstick but nevertheless remains “a yardstick…(to be) taken and balanced with all of the other relevant factors” (see Markarian v The Queen at 1056 [31]). In the present case the sentencing judge was clearly mindful of the maximum penalty. 
     
      
    85 The respondent pleaded guilty and was allowed a discount in penalty of 25 per cent for his plea of guilty. 
     
      
    86 Some allowance could properly be made for the severe extra-curial punishment the respondent had suffered and would suffer, including the virtually certain loss of his profession of 25 years and his livelihood. Some allowance, albeit only limited, could be made for the public humiliation the respondent had suffered. 
     
      
    87 The sentencing judge could also take into account favourable subjective features of the respondent’s, including contrition and Dr Allnutt’s opinion, which the sentencing judge accepted, that, when regard was had to all factors, the risk of the respondent re-offending was low.  
     
      
    88 It is true that the maximum penalty for an offence under s 474.26 of the Criminal Code is much higher than was the maximum penalty for an offence under s 218A(1)(a) of the Queensland Criminal Code. However, the sentence imposed on the respondent was higher than any of the sentences imposed on any of the Queensland offenders and, as regards the time required to be actually served in prison, much higher. 
     
      
    89 The conclusion I have come to is that the present appeal is not one of those rare Crown appeals in which the appeal should be allowed, notwithstanding that the Crown cannot point to any specific error in the sentencing process, and I would, accordingly, dismiss the appeal. As should be clear from what I have written, I have reached this result by an application of the principles governing Crown appeals against sentence. 
     
      
    90 ROTHMAN J: I have had the advantage of reading the reasons in draft of James J. I agree with his Honour’s reasons and the orders he proposes. The following comments do not detract from the force of those reasons.  
     
      
    91 The relevant jurisdiction conferred on the Court of Criminal Appeal is to correct error. In the case of Crown appeals there is a live discretion exercised by the Court not to interfere even when error is shown and the requirements of section 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) have been satisfied.  
     
      
    92 In the current appeal, there is no error of fact. The Crown so concedes. Nor can the Crown identify any error of principle or law. The Crown therefore relies on manifest error; i.e. an error that is manifest from the result even though it is unclear or unknown how the error occurred: House v R (1936) 55 CLR 499 at 505.  
     
      
    93 It is usual, in those circumstances, in a Crown appeal, for the Crown to seek to show that the sentence imposed is not only less than is warranted but so much less as to be outside the range of available sentences. In this appeal, the Crown has quite properly conceded that the sentence imposed by his Honour Judge Norrish QC was, if there be a range, above it. Such a comparison with the range is analysed by James J.  
     
      
    94 The gravamen of the Crown appeal is that with the alterations to the offence and maximum sentence, the sentences being imposed (not necessarily that of Judge Norrish QC) are too lenient. If one were examining the sentences previously imposed for this or like offences in Victoria and Queensland, and measuring same against the current maximum sentence, there is much force in the Crown submission. But that is not our task. Our task is to examine only the sentence imposed by Judge Norrish QC and determine whether it displays error.  
     
      
    95 The offence in question is a legislative attempt to regulate and prohibit the use of modern technology in the abuse of children. The fact, if it be the fact, that the perpetrator is not intending to act on her/his statements, because she/he is indulging in a fantasy, may be relevant to sentence, but is not the most relevant feature.  
     
      
    96 The legislature, with this provision, is seeking to implement society’s abhorrence of the practice of inducing children to engage in inappropriate sexual behaviour. That process includes not only the direct and physical abuse of children but the “grooming” of children to accept more readily inappropriate sexual activity. Even though a perpetrator of an offence of this kind may have no intention of acting out the fantasy or fantasies in which she/he is indulging, the conduct has a significant deleterious impact upon any child participating in it.  
     
      
    97 In the particular instance with which Judge Norrish QC was dealing, the offender was committing the offence on a telephone service which overtly encouraged sexual discussion and fantasy, if not more. That fact is, it seems to me, far more relevant as one of the criteria by which a sentencing judge would determine the criminal culpability of the offender. If, for example, the offence were committed on persons who were not voluntarily engaged in sexual discussions, the criminal culpability would be much worse.  
     
      
    98 The respondent offender has particular subjective features all of which have been described by James J and were factors considered by Norrish DCJ. Sentencing, as earlier stated, is an intuitive synthesis of the conflicting goals in order to derive an appropriate result: Markarian, supra. Judge Norrish QC is a most experienced sentencing judge who, in this case, imposed a sentence, quite deliberately, to take account of all of the relevant factors, and no others. Even though, given the increased penalty applicable under the amended provision, this sentence would be at or near the bottom of the range, it is not, in the circumstances, below it. 
     
      
    99 I agree with the reasons of James J and the orders proposed by his Honour.  
     
      
    100 HARRISON J: I agree with James J.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 GILES JA: The appellant was tried before J B Phelan DCJ and a jury on ten charges of sexual assault alleged to have occurred in the period August 1998 – April 2001. The complainant was aged from five and a half years to eight years at the time of the alleged offences. Seven charges were of aggravated indecent assault, the aggravation lying in the complainant’s age (Crimes Act 1900, s 61M(2)); two were of sexual intercourse with a person under ten (s 66A); and one was of aggravated indecency (s 61O(2)). The appellant was found guilty on all charges, and was sentenced to terms of imprisonment for an overall non-parole period of six years and an additional period of two years. He appealed against conviction and applied for leave to appeal against sentence. 
     
      
    2 The grounds of appeal against conviction as filed were - 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        (A) Miscarriage of justice 
        
       
       
        
        The trial in this matter miscarried due to one, more or a combination of some or all of the following grounds: 
        
       
       
        
        Ground 1: “Complaint” 
        
       
       
        
        That all aspects of the issue of complaint including: 
        
       
       
        
        (a) The first statement made by the complainant; 
        
       
       
        
        (b) The initial denial of the complainant in relation to the appellant; 
         
         
        (c) The leading nature of the complaint arising from the mother of the complainant; 
         
         
        (d) And, ultimately, the retracting of same by the Trial Judge from the jury; 
        
       
       
        
        are erroneous and have unfairly prejudiced the appellant. 
        
       
       
        
        Ground 2: 
         [abandoned] 
        
       
       
        
        Ground 3: “Admissions” 
        
       
       
        
        That the letters of the accused sent to the complainant’s mother, although designated as merely establishing the relationship between the complainant and the appellant, created such a prejudice to the appellant that it far outweighed any probative value it may have had. 
        
       
       
        
        Ground 4: “Confession” 
        
       
       
        
        That the so-called confession by the appellant to the Christian Minister, used to establish the said relationship, in reality must have been viewed as an ‘admission’ to the specific counts alleged, to which the appellant could not fairly defend himself. 
        
       
       
        
        Ground 5: “Silence” 
        
       
       
        
        That in the particular circumstances of this case and especially the above grounds, the failure to call evidence from the accused himself, plus the comments made thereon, caused the appellant to lose any chance of acquittal whatsoever. 
        
       
       
        
        (B) Verdicts Unreasonable 
        
       
       
        
        The 10 verdicts of the jury, based predominantly on the evidence and therefore credit of the complainant were unreasonable in that they were unsafe and unsatisfactory, for one or some or all of the following reasons: 
        
       
       
        
        Ground 6: “Inconsistencies of Opportunity” 
        
       
       
        
        That inconsistencies as to the opportunities for committing the offences were not properly considered; otherwise reasonable doubt as to guilt should have been made out and reflected in the verdicts. 
        
       
       
        
        Ground 7: “Lack of Corroboration” 
        
       
       
        
        The specific evidence of the complainant is so uncorroborated by any admissible and supporting evidence, that the jury should have been instructed that it  
        must 
         be dangerous, as distinct from ‘may’, to convict in such a situation. 
        
       
       
        
        Ground 8: “Lies of Complainant” 
        
       
       
        
        That the self-confessed lies and imaginary-type explanations in telling same by the complainant should have caused reasonable doubt as to her credit. 
        
       
       
        
        Ground 9: “Motives of Mother” 
        
       
       
        
        That the possible motives of the complainant’s mother in influencing the complainant should have created, if properly considered, sufficient apprehension as to cause reasonable doubt. 
        
       
       
        
        Ground 10: “Influence of Pornography” 
        
       
       
        
        That the uncontested existence of pornographic videos, and at least some viewing by the complainant, should have created reasonable apprehension as to the credit of the complainant and the reliability of the mother with regard to the sexual knowledge of the complainant in such matters. 
        
       
       
        
        Ground 11: “Whole of Evidence” 
        
       
       
        
        That the whole of the evidence as it unfolded and presented in the course and conduct of the trial and in the context of the verdicts delivered was such as it could not be open to a jury to find guilt beyond reasonable doubt.” 
        
       
       
      
    3 At the hearing there was added a ground of appeal, which I will call ground 11A, effectively as amplification of ground 5 - 
     
      
       
        
        “Due to counsel’s advice in the trial to the appellant that he should not give evidence and the acceptance of that advice by the appellant, the appellant was denied the opportunity of explaining matters without which explanation cost him the chance of an acquittal and caused a miscarriage of justice.” 
        
       
      
    4 The grounds of appeal against sentence as filed were - 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        Ground 12: “Overall Sentence” 
        
       
       
        
        That the overall head sentence imposed of 8 years is manifestly excessive. 
        
       
       
        
        Ground 13: “Special Circumstances” 
        
       
       
        
        That in all the circumstances of this case, special circumstances do exist and should have been found to reduce the period of non-parole custody.” 
        
       
      
    5 The appeal and application were listed for hearing before this Court, differently constituted, in December 2006. When the appellant reached his submissions on ground 5, he applied for “leave … to explain why he didn’t give evidence”. In the result the hearing was adjourned, with a direction for filing of evidentiary material and any amended ground of appeal; hence ground 11A, although it was only added at the adjourned hearing. When the appeal was re-listed for hearing before the Court as presently constituted the appellant and the Crown agreed that it should not be treated as part-heard before the Court as originally constituted, but that regard should be had to the transcript of the partial hearing in December 2006.  
     
      
       
      Background 
       
      
    6 The complainant was born on 17 February 1993. A younger brother was born on 13 May 1995. Their mother and father separated. The mother commenced a relationship with the appellant in the latter part of 1997, and the mother and the appellant were married in January 1998. 
     
      
    7 In about June 1998 the mother and the appellant moved, with the two children, from Victoria to New South Wales. They lived for a short time in rented premises at Bega, then in a house on a dairy farm at Numbugga. In June 1999 the mother bought a property at Wolumla. At first the family stayed in a shed built on the Wolumla property, a double garage partitioned by furniture into sleeping and living areas with an adjoining tent as a bathing area, while their house was being built. They moved into the house in December 1999. 
     
      
    8 After their mother moved to New South Wales the children’s father saw them monthly (fortnightly for the first six months), and the children spent their school holidays with their father in Victoria.  
     
      
    9 The appellant suffered from a back complaint, and did not work in employment during this time. From December 1998 to June 1999 the mother worked in Bega four days a week from 10 am until 4 pm. She did manual work at the Wolumla property as the house was being built, and after completion of the house worked at night (8 pm – 12 pm) between April and July 2000. Over the whole period the appellant left, as a result of arguments with the mother, on five occasions each for some days or weeks. On 11 April 2001, following another argument, he left and did not return.  
     
      
    10 The complainant first told her mother of the appellant’s conduct on 17 May 2001. The mother then went to the police. 
     
      
       
      The Crown case 
       
      
    11 In chronological order, the charges against the appellant were in summary as follows.  
     
      
       
      Count 1: 
       
       
      At Numbugga, when the complainant was five or six years old, that the appellant took her hand while he was lying on his bed and used it to masturbate him (aggravated indecent assault).  
       
       
      Count 2: 
       
       
      On the same occasion, that after the complainant left the appellant caused her to return and the same occurred (aggravated indecent assault). 
       
       
      Count 3: 
       
       
      In the shed at Wolumla, when the complainant was six years old, that after the complainant had had a bath the appellant put her on the top bunk in the children’s sleeping area and licked her vagina (sexual intercourse). 
       
       
      Count 4: 
       
       
      In the shed at Wolumla, when the complainant was six years old, that the appellant took her onto the master bed and put his penis in her mouth (sexual intercourse). 
       
       
      Count 5: 
       
       
      In the house at Wolumla, when the complainant was six or seven years old, that the appellant took her into the master bedroom and made her rub his penis (aggravated indecent assault). 
       
       
      Count 6: 
       
       
      On the same occasion, that the appellant took the complainant’s clothes off and sat her on top of himself and rubbed his penis along the outside of her vagina (aggravated indecent assault). 
       
       
      Count 7: 
       
       
      On the same occasion, that the appellant masturbated himself in front of the complainant until he ejaculated (aggravated indecency).  
       
       
      Count 8:  
       
       
      In the house at Wolumla, when the complainant was eight years old, that on the couch in the lounge room the appellant took the complainant’s hand and used it to masturbate him (aggravated indecent assault). 
       
       
      Count 9: 
       
       
      In the house at Wolumla, when the complainant was eight years old, that in the kitchen the appellant made the complainant masturbate him until he ejaculated (aggravated indecent assault). 
       
       
      Count 10: 
       
       
      In the house at Wolumla, when the complainant was eight years old, that the appellant pulled the complainant from the floor onto the couch in the lounge room where he made her masturbate him (aggravated indecent assault). 
       
      
    12 The charges in counts 1-7 were not specific as to time, but were in the form of “between 1 August 1998 and 21 June 1999” (count 1). Count 8 charged an offence on or about 20 March 2001, identified from a television programme. Counts 9 and 10 charged offences between 1 and 11 April 2001, identified by proximity to the appellant’s final departure. 
     
      
    13 The Crown case essentially rested on the complainant’s evidence, together with the evidence of an examining doctor who took a sexual assault history and evidence found in letters written by the appellant to the mother and in communications between the appellant and a minister of religion, Mr Ian Weerawardena. 
     
      
    14 The complainant made two recorded interviews with police officers, one on 30 May 2001 and the other on 17 December 2002. At the time of the trial the complainant was aged eleven. The judge was satisfied that she understood the difference between the truth and a lie and her duty to tell the truth, and she gave evidence by closed circuit television (see Pt 4 of the Evidence (Children) Act 1997). The audio tapes of the recorded interviews were admitted and were played to the jury (see Pt 3 of the Evidence (Children) Act). The jury were provided with transcripts as aides memoire. One transcript was of 64 pages, in the form of 531 questions and answers; the other was of 27 pages, 208 questions and answers. There was no objection to any part of the audio tapes or the provision of the transcripts. In evidence in chief the complainant affirmed that, save as to two matters which she corrected, what was said in the recorded interviews was true. It is not necessary to detail the appellant’s conduct described in the recorded interviews; if accepted by the jury, the evidence thus given by the complainant amply made out the charges. Corrections made and particular aspects of the appellant’s conduct as described will, however, be considered later in these reasons. 
     
      
    15 The complainant was medically examined on 29 May 2001. The doctor gave evidence of taking a sexual assault history, which matched although without the detail the nature of the acts later described in the recorded interviews. It is not necessary to recount the history more fully; it was of the appellant making the complainant touch his penis, ejaculating, taking her clothes off and sitting her on top of his penis, and on one occasion licking her vagina. The evidence of the medical examination was essentially neutral; the doctor said that she did not expect, from the history, to see any signs of trauma. There was no objection to the doctor’s evidence. 
     
      
    16 The evidence through the letters was four letters written by the appellant to the complainant’s mother, dated 11, 13 and 17 June 2001 and 1 April 2002. There was no objection to the tender of the letters. In the light of ground 3 of the grounds of appeal, I set out the particularly relevant parts of the letters. 
     
      
    17 The letter of 11 June 2001 included - 
     
      
       
        
        “I am truly very ashamed for what has happened, I do not even have the right to ask you for your forgiveness. I have confessed all to Ian, he wanted to know the what’s but he wouldn’t hear the why’s, he was very angry with me that day.  
         
         
        … 
         
         
        I can only promise to you that things would be so very different and where [the complainant] is concerned all I can say is my promise to God that I have made (no more).” 
        
       
      
    18 “Ian” in this letter was Mr Weerawardena, and it will be seen later in these reasons that what was written is linked with his evidence. 
     
      
    19 The letter of 13 June 2001 included - 
     
      
       
        
        “Firstly, though I must again apologise for what has happened, I told you on the phone this morning how I tried for so long to stop and you only thought that I had something for [the complainant’s brother] when you saw me push [the complainant] away, how could I tell you! You know how she is she would be on your lap and start to gyrate herself; No! My love I’m not finding excuses nor saying [the complainant] is to blame for I alone am at fault in letting it happen and to say how ashamed I am seems such a small word as to how I feel. I am truly so very sorry.” 
        
       
      
    20 The letter of 17 June 2001 included - 
     
      
       
        
        “I know that by this letter I have broken all agreements, you have the ability to send me to prison if you want … I am ashamed of myself for what has happened, but do you not see how easy it is for this sort of thing to happen and me being me, I am so weak as anything sexual is a big thing for me! I could apologise to you all until the day I die and I know that it still will not be enough! I am so very, very sorry.” 
        
       
      
    21 The letter of 1 April 2002 referred more generally to “things have happened that I am deeply ashamed of”.  
     
      
    22 The appellant encountered Mr Weerawardena, a minister of the Assemblies of God Church, shortly after leaving on 11 April 2001. He became a member of Mr Weerawardena’s congregation and was baptised into his church. Mr Weerawardena had some discussions with the complainant’s mother and the appellant concerning the state of their marriage, and then on two occasions had conversations with the appellant on which the Crown relied. Again, in the light of ground 4 of the grounds of appeal I set out the particularly relevant evidence.  
     
      
    23 Mr Weerawardena gave the evidence without objection, which I will call the first Weerawardena evidence - 
     
      
       
        
        “CROWN PROSECUTOR: Q. She [the complainant’s mother] then rang you? 
         
        A. She rang me. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. She said something to you about her daughter? 
         
        A. Exactly, yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. As a result of that telephone call did you contact Mr Rolfe? 
         
        A. Yes, that day we were having lunch and I had this phone call, I called Mark outside where we were having lunch and I asked him ‘Mark, I’ve just got to know that there’s more to your confessions. On the grounds of your confession we accepted you and as a minister we prayed and granted, you know, to that we could grant forgiveness, but before God, you know. But then new issues are coming out which you never confessed to me’, and I asked him that day ‘Have you committed such a thing?’ 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Do you remember what words you actually said? 
         
        A. Yes, I asked him ‘Have you – according to the mother’, I’ve forgotten the name, [mother’s first name], she states that Mark here has abused her daughter, and I asked him ‘Mark, tell me the truth, why did you lie to me’, then he nodded his head. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Sorry, in relation to what question did he nod his head? 
         
        A. That he has abused [mother’s first name’s] daughter.” 
        
       
      
    24 Mr Weerawardena then gave what I will call the second Weerawardena evidence, over the objection that it should be excluded for unfairness under s 90 of the Evidence Act 1995. He said that some months later the appellant came to his church and showed him a document to do with a police charge of child abuse, that in the ensuing conversation he said to the appellant that “all what you said to me I will tell the law”, and - 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Did he say anything to you after you said that to him?  
         
        A. Yes, he said that, yes he said, ‘I did not penetrate’, that’s what he said, yeah. ‘I did not penetrate, it was’, yeah I mentioned yesterday it was all. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Q. Just tell us, you said he said, ‘I did not penetrate’? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did he refer to who or what? 
         
        A. The little girl, yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did he go on to say anything else concerning the girl? 
         
        A. You want me to say what I said yesterday? 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Yes, please just tell us what you recall, sir? 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What he actually said? 
         
        A. What he said, yes. The both of them were in bed together at times and the little girl would creep into the bed (a), and (b) is when sometimes mum goes to work and the girl used to stay around and then he had whatever sexual contact with her.” 
        
       
       
      The appeal against conviction 
       
      
    25 The transcript of the partial hearing in December 2006 reveals that the Court had difficulty in obtaining assistance in the exposition of the grounds of appeal. The difficulty continued at the hearing before the Court as presently constituted. The submissions were diffuse, and in what follows I have sought to encapsulate their substance as I understood it. 
     
      
       
      Ground 1: “Complaint” 
       
      
    26 The appellant submitted in his written submissions that the “handling of the aspects of complaint” at the trial was such as to have brought a miscarriage of justice. I first describe what occurred, and then go to the mis-handling for which the appellant contended.  
     
      
    27 The complainant’s recorded interview of 30 May 2001 included, after the complainant’s description of the events the subject of counts 1 and 2, that the appellant gave the complainant a lollipop and told her not to tell her mother because she would be angry with them both, and that the complainant had not told anyone “Because Mark’s been with us and if I told he would know”. It continued - 
     
      
       
        
        “Q223 So who is the first person you ever told about this? 
         
        A. Mum 
        
       
       
        
        Q224 And do you remember when that was? 
         
        A Two weeks ago in the bathroom. 
        
       
       
        
        Q225 And how come, well, can you tell me what you first said to mum two weeks ago in the bathroom? 
         
        A Well, I was talking about something, I can’t remember what I said … I don’t know what I said. And Mum said, Has Mark ever tried to rape you? And I said, No. And I think it was really in … No, like that. And then she said, [complainant’s name], tell me. Mark’s gone. And then I started crying and told her that I did, that he did.” 
        
       
      
    28 The complainant’s mother made a statement dated 30 May 2001. It included - 
     
      
       
        
        “6. On the 17th May, 2001 during the evening just after [the complainant] had a bath she told me something. We were in the bathroom and I was just putting her towel around her and she made an odd comment to [the complainant’s brother] who was there also. She said, ‘Daddy will rape you.’ She just said that out of the blue, it had nothing to do with whatever she was talking about at the time. I said, ‘[complainant’s name] you shouldn’t say things like that about your dad, you’ll put him in gaol if you say things like that. Your daddy loves you.’ It occurred to me that she wasn’t talking about her daddy, her real daddy [name of complainant’s father] her real dad who lives in Melbourne. She calls Mark, Mark. I said, ‘[complainant’s name] did Mark touch you?’ She said ‘Yes Mama.’ [The complainant] then started crying.” 
        
       
      
    29 The statement continued with what the complainant told her mother, on that occasion and on occasions on the following days, of what the appellant had done.  
     
      
    30 As I have said, the audio tape of the recorded interview was admitted without objection. I will refer to its questions and answers 223-225 as the interview complaint, and to the relevant part of the mother’s statement (which did not go into evidence) as the statement complaint. 
     
      
    31 Early in his cross-examination of the complainant counsel for the appellant obtained her agreement that she first told her mother what had happened to her on about 17 May 2001, in the bathroom in the evening. Plainly cross-examining from the statement complaint, he asked whether she said to her brother “Daddy will rape you”. The complainant said that she thought she said something like that sarcastically, but was not sure; further questions brought that she did not really remember saying it, she might have.  
     
      
    32 The cross-examination continued - 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Didn’t your mum say to you, ‘[complainant’s name] you shouldn’t say things like that about your dad, you’ll put him in gaol if you say things like that. Your daddy loves you’. Didn’t your mum say that to you while you were in the bathroom with [the complainant’s brother]? 
         
        A. Actually I think yes she did say that, I think I might have said that to [the complainant’s brother], I wasn’t really sure. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Do you remember your mum saying that to you? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Have you told anybody else that your dad had touched you in the genital area, do you know what I’m talking about in relation to the genital area? 
         
        A. My dad. 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: Your Honour, this raises a matter that should be discussed in the absence of the jury.” 
        
       
      
    33 It became common ground before the judge (and remains common ground) that by “dad” was meant the complainant’s father, the appellant being known as Mark.  
     
      
    34 The Crown Prosecutor submitted to the judge that “this kind of questioning” was impermissible under s 293 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986, in that it was “putting to this witness a sexual experience with another person other than the accused”. It is convenient at this point to set out s 293 so far as its terms might be material in the appeal - 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        293 Admissibility of evidence relating to sexual experience 
         
         
        (1) This section applies to proceedings in respect of a prescribed sexual offence. 
         
         
        (2) Evidence relating to the sexual reputation of the complainant is inadmissible. 
         
         
        (3) Evidence that discloses or implies:  
         
         
          
          (a) that the complainant has or may have had sexual experience or a lack of sexual experience, or 
           
           
          (b) has or may have taken part or not taken part in any sexual activity, 
          
         
         
         is inadmissible. 
         
         
        (4) Subsection (3) does not apply:  
         
         
          
          (a) if the evidence:  
          
         
         
          
           
            
            (i) is of the complainant’s sexual experience or lack of sexual experience, or of sexual activity or lack of sexual activity taken part in by the complainant, at or about the time of the commission of the alleged prescribed sexual offence, and 
             
             
            (ii) is of events that are alleged to form part of a connected set of circumstances in which the alleged prescribed sexual offence was committed, 
             
            
           
          (b) if the evidence relates to a relationship that was existing or recent at the time of the commission of the alleged prescribed sexual offence, being a relationship between the accused person and the complainant, 
           
           
          … 
           
           
          (f) if the evidence has been given by the complainant in cross-examination by or on behalf of the accused person, being evidence given in answer to a question that may, pursuant to subsection (6), be asked, 
           
           
          and if the probative value of the evidence outweighs any distress, humiliation or embarrassment that the complainant might suffer as a result of its admission. 
          
         
         
        (5) A witness must not be asked:  
         
         
          
          (a) to give evidence that is inadmissible under subsection (2) or (3), or 
           
           
          (b) by or on behalf of the accused person, to give evidence that is or may be admissible under subsection (4) unless the court has previously decided that the evidence would, if given, be admissible. 
          
         
         
        (6) If the court is satisfied:  
         
         
          
          (a) that it has been disclosed or implied in the case for the prosecution against the accused person that the complainant has or may have, during a specified period or without reference to any period:  
          
         
         
          
           
            
            (i) had sexual experience, or a lack of sexual experience, of a general or specified nature, or 
             
             
            (ii) had taken part in, or not taken part in, sexual activity of a general or specified nature, and 
            
           
          
         
         
          
          (b) the accused person might be unfairly prejudiced if the complainant could not be cross-examined by or on behalf of the accused person in relation to the disclosure or implication, 
          
         
         
          
          the complainant may be so cross-examined, but only in relation to the experience or activity of the nature (if any) so specified during the period (if any) so specified. 
          
         
         
        (7) On the trial of a person, any question as to the admissibility of evidence under subsection (2) or (3) or the right to cross-examine under subsection (6) is to be decided by the court in the absence of the jury. 
         
         
        (8) If the court decides that evidence is admissible under subsection (4), the court must, before the evidence is given, record or cause to be recorded in writing the nature and scope of the evidence that is so admissible and the reasons for that decision.” 
        
       
      
    35 The Crown Prosecutor supported his submission with reference to M v R (1993) 67 A Crim R 549 and R v Bernthaler (CCA, 17 December 1993, unreported).  
     
      
    36 The judge called on counsel for the appellant, and - 
     
      
       
        
        “HOENIG: Your Honour, the Crown are going to lead evidence of what I put to the witness from the victim’s mother. It comes straight from her statement that is that the victim said to her brother ‘Daddy will rape you’ and that witness will say she told the victim that ‘You shouldn’t say things like that about your dad, you’ll put him in gaol if you say things like that. Your daddy loves you’, referring to the child’s natural father. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Mr Crown, is that correct, is that evidence -- 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: No, I haven’t led that your Honour. I intended to lead evidence of complaint about the sexual assault by this accused but not that part of it because to do so would be in breach of the section myself and when I opened to the jury I was specifically careful in what I said in relation to that. 
        
       
       
        
        HOENIG: However, the conversation that comprises of the complaint is a series of conversation that commences with that. Because following from that, your Honour, following from that conversation the witness says in her statement, 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘It occurred to me that she wasn’t talking about her daddy, her real daddy [name of the complainant’s father], her real dad, who lives in Melbourne. She calls Mark, Mark. I said ‘[complainant’s name], did Mark touch you?’ She said, ‘Yes mama’. [The complainant] then started crying’. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        Now that’s one transaction conversation that comprises of the complaint. If the Crown wasn’t going to lead all of it I certainly would have put the rest of it in in cross-examination because of the circumstances of that conversation. The child makes an observation that relates to her father. The mother knows that the child refers to her father as daddy and her husband as Mark, then puts a question directly to the child, “[complainant’s name], did Mark touch you?’. It’s one complaint and one series of acts and one series of complaints that would have been in my submission admissible. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Are you saying that the complaint was not a spontaneous or voluntary one but in response to a leading question? 
        
       
       
        
        HOENIG: Yes, yes and the nature of complaint. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Doesn’t that mean I can exclude it if that’s the case? 
        
       
       
        
        HOENIG: One could exclude the complaint? 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Yes, as not being a falling within the ground rules so to speak. 
        
       
       
        
        HOENIG: Yes, but I haven’t frankly objected to it because of the preceding part of it because that is -- 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Mr Crown, don’t these cases really represent material that hasn’t [sic] got this ambiguity of being both potentially breaching the section but also forming the conversation that was the subject of the complaint. 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: No, your Honour what I’d propose -- 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: You can’t very well have your cake and eat it too. 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: Unfortunately your Honour, in fact this very point has been raised before the Court of Criminal Appeal before about this section and its equivalents before it was amended or before it became in the Criminal Procedure Act and the Court of Criminal Appeal’s made it plain that it may appear that sometimes the section works an injustice to the accused in the sense that it restricts their right to cross-examine what would otherwise be fertile and relevant grounds. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: That might be another matter but this is a particular refinement, is it not? 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: Can I indicate to your Honour this? What I propose to do was to lead evidence from the mother that something was said, bearing in mind that the child herself in the interviews does not give evidence of what exactly was said in the complaint. She simply says that she told her mother something. I intended to lead from the mother that something was said and then you asked her a question and she responded to that. 
        
       
       
        
        I raised, your Honour the issue of complaint with my friend before the trial commenced because I wanted to know whether he objected to it and indeed the Crown concedes that had my friend objected to the complaint because it was followed from a leading question, your Honour would be entitled to exclude it but my friend said to me that he didn’t object to the complaint evidence. There was no indication from my friend at that time nor need he give me any indication as to the tactical reasons he wanted to have that but there was no indication, he simply said I don’t object to it. It was never my intention, your Honour to lead evidence of that part because it breaches the section. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Subject to anything further you might have to say it is my view that it should be excluded. 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: In that case, your Honour I would ask it all be excluded. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: That’s what I mean. 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: Yes, but we’re left now with this difficulty, the question that my friend has already put to the witness. The Crown now, your Honour is in this somewhat invidious position that a question has been put, an answer has been given. That then is floating around in the jury’s mind as to what that might mean. Might it mean that the natural father had in fact touched this complainant and not this accused, and now the Crown is unable to lead any evidence from the mother as to the conversation where the child makes it plain that it is the accused. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: I’ll simply direct the jury that they should ignore it. Do you have anything further to put, Mr Hoenig? 
        
       
       
        
        HOENIG: Your Honour, I’m not sure. A conversation, I mean the first question is this. It is suggested that what I actually put from the mother’s statement to the child was inadmissible and is that to be excluded? 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Yes. It seems to me inadmissible on two grounds. Firstly, that it was not spontaneous and secondly it breaches the section but if you have a reasoned argument I’m prepared to listen to it.” 
        
       
      
    37 After further discussion the trial was adjourned to the next day, with counsel to undertake further researches.  
     
      
    38 On the next morning - 
     
      
       
        
        “HOENIG: Your Honour, an objection was taken yesterday afternoon by the learned Crown Prosecutor in relation to a question I asked the witness on the basis that it infringed the prescription [sic] contained within section 293 of the Criminal Procedure Act. The learned Crown Prosecutor relied on the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in M, reported at 67 ACR 549, and Bernthaler, an unreported decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal of 17 December 1993. In that case the Court comprised of his Honour the President, Kirby J, Badgery-Parker J and Ireland J. 
        
       
       
        
        The objection taken by the learned Crown on the basis of those authorities your Honour is well-founded, although in my submission the Court was in error in relation to section 293 of the Criminal Procedure Act in its interpretation. However, the decision of M is binding on your Honour and for that reason I withdraw the question. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: All right. 
        
       
       
        
        HOENIG: And arising from M, the question and answer given by the child in relation to what the child told her brother in the bath, that is, ‘Be careful, daddy will rape you’, that also offends in accordance with the principles of M, section 293, and it is our joint application that that evidence be excluded. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Yes, I make that order. Perhaps that should be mentioned to the jury.” 
         
        
       
      
    39 After discussion of another matter - 
     
      
       
        
         
        “HIS HONOUR: What is it that has to be said to the jury? 
        
       
       
        
        HOENIG: In respect to the evidence that has already been given? 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Yes. Could we have the wording of that just to make sure there is no confusion. 
        
       
       
        
        HOENIG: Yes your Honour, just pardon me. 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: As described in the statement of [the complainant’s mother] of 30 May 2001, emanating from the complainant the words, ‘Daddy will rape you”, said to [the complainant’s brother], and the mother of the complainant saying, “[complainant’s name], you shouldn’t say things like that about your dad, you’ll put him in gaol if you say things like that. Your daddy loves you’. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Just start again, the mother said to [complainant’s name]? 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR. The mother replies to her, ‘[complainant’s name], you shouldn’t say things like that about your dad’. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: ‘You’ll put him in gaol if you say things like that. Your daddy loves you’. And then there was the question that my friend asked and I will leave that to my friend. 
        
       
       
        
        HOENIG: ‘Have you ever complained to anyone else about your dad touching your genitals?’ That was the question that was objected to and that’s the question I withdraw. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: About ‘your dad touching your genitals’? 
        
       
       
        
        HOENIG: Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: So that is withdrawn as well, is it, that first? 
        
       
       
        
        HOENIG: That will require an order from your Honour to exclude that evidence. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: And indeed your Honour the response given too because the portion of the statement of the mother which my friend put to the complainant was in the form of a question, ‘Did you say something like that to your mum?’, and she replied I think, words to the effect of, ‘I think something like that’, or some words like that, or the answer that she gave to my friend in response to that would need to be excluded as well. 
        
       
       
        
        HOENIG: Yes your Honour. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: You mean the question? 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: The question and the answer. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: We had better have it played back just to make sure we have got it right. 
        
       
       
        
        HOENIG: Yes your Honour. 
        
       
       
        
        PLAYBACK 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Rather than go through all of that it might be simpler if I simply say that the evidence on that subject is excluded and they must disregard it. 
        
       
       
        
        HOENIG: Yes your Honour. 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: Yes your Honour. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: That is to say, reference to anything to do with, ‘Daddy will rape you’. 
        
       
       
        
        HOENIG: Yes your Honour. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: All right, we will do it that way. 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: And any comment she might have made – the question relating to having told someone else. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Sorry? 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: The question relating to having told anyone else. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: But that was never replied. 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: No, it wasn’t but still your Honour I would ask that that question be excluded as an improper question. 
        
       
       
        
        HOENIG: That’s a question that I withdraw and I will formally withdraw that when the jury come in. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Yes, all right, do that and then I will exclude the other. 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: Your Honour, just very briefly, your Honour made orders yesterday excluding any evidence of complaint and I will be making no reference or asking no question as to particulars of complaint made.” 
        
       
      
    40 When the jury returned - 
     
      
       
        
        “HIS HONOUR: Members of the jury, it must be puzzling to you, and to a degree frustrating, when you are asked to wait for some time while legal matters are considered. So I appreciate any frustration that you feel. 
        
       
       
        
        I understand Mr Hoenig that you wish to withdraw the last question. 
        
       
       
        
        HOENIG: Yes, the question I asked that’s objected to your Honour, I withdraw that question. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: And that question was? 
        
       
       
        
        HOENIG: The question was to the effect whether she had told anybody else that her dad had touched her in the genital area. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: As a matter of law I am striking from the record any reference to that conversation that emerged in the evidence about, ‘Daddy will rape you’, allegedly said by the witness to [the claimant’s brother]. That reference, all of that evidence is excluded and it must form no part of your considerations.” 
        
       
      
    41 Counsel for the appellant asked no further questions in cross-examination in relation to complaint. When the complainant’s mother was called to give evidence, the Crown Prosecutor relevantly elicited only that she had a conversation with the complainant on 17 May 2001 and as a result went to the police. Counsel for the appellant asked her no questions in cross-examination in relation to complaint. 
     
      
    42 Neither the Crown Prosecutor nor counsel for the appellant referred in his address to the jury to the interview complaint, or said anything in relation to complaint. In his summing-up, however, the judge gave directions concerning complaint as evidence of consistency and the need to consider whether there is good reason for delay in complaint, and in the course of doing so referred to the interview complaint - 
     
      
       
        
        “In this particular case you know from the evidence that these matters came to light in May, not long after the accused left the home for good in April 2001 and that you may remember that in her statement to you the complainant said two weeks before he statement at the end of May that, she was asked when was it she first said anything about these things and said, ‘Two weeks ago in the bathroom’. This is at question 224. Question, ‘How come, well can you tell me what you first said to Mum two weeks ago in the bathroom?’, and her mum asked her, ‘Has Mark ever tried to rape you?’, and she said, ‘No’, and then she said, ‘[the claimant], tell me, Mark’s gone’, and then I started crying and told her that he did’, and it was in the context that he had said to her when the first alleged offence occurred that he said,  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘Never tell Mamma that we did this because she’ll get angry at you. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Q. She’ll get angry at who? 
           
          A. Me and him’. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        She then said,  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘I haven’t told anyone for three years. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Q. Can I ask you how come? 
           
          A. Answer, because Mark’s been with us and if I told he would know’. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        … “ 
        
       
      
    43 Neither the Crown Prosecutor nor counsel for the appellant responded to this by submitting to the judge that the evidence of the interview complaint was not before the jury, or asked for a correction or addition to the summing-up in relation to complaint.  
     
      
    44 I come then to the mis-handling for which the appellant contended. It was not said on appeal that the judge’s directions in relation to complaint were deficient. The appellant submitted that the trial had miscarried because there should have been before the jury either the whole of the material concerning complaint, the interview complaint in the Crown case together with the statement complaint elicited through cross-examination plus the cross-examination on which counsel for the appellant had embarked by his question about telling anyone else of touching by the complainant’s dad in the genital area, or none of it. Instead, according to the thrust of the submissions, the jury was left with the evidence of the interview complaint, to which the judge made specific reference in his summing up, but the appellant had been unable to seek to ameliorate the significance which the jury might have given to that evidence, or more positively to seek to turn the occasion into one on which the complainant was brought to make false allegations against the appellant by cross-examination founded on the statement complaint.  
     
      
    45 As I understand it, the appellant’s submissions came to include that there had been error in that, although the judge ruled that all evidence of complaint should be withdrawn from the jury, there was left before the jury the evidence of the interview complaint.  
     
      
    46 I do not think that is correct. While the judge indicated at one point that “it” should all be excluded, the subject-matter was the statement complaint and “it” was evidence to be led from the complainant’s mother in relation to complaint; not complaint evidence so far as found in the interview complaint. By exclusion of “it”, all that was meant that the Crown should not, as the Crown Prosecutor had proposed, lead evidence from the mother “that something was said and then you asked her a question and she responded to that”, with the response as evidence of complaint to the mother. Hence the Crown Prosecutor said, immediately before the jury returned, that because of exclusion of any evidence of complaint “I will be making no reference or asking no question as to particulars of complaint made”. He was speaking of the evidence to be led from the complainant’s mother. 
     
      
    47 That this is how the position was understood at the time is apparent from the agreement upon what was to be withdrawn from the jury, which was explicitly directed to the “Daddy will rape you” and subsequent matters found in the statement complaint. It would be remarkable if all concerned had overlooked that the evidence before the jury included the interview complaint, when the audio tapes had been played to the jury earlier the same day. Indeed, in the discussion at the time the Crown Prosecutor adverted to the evidence of the interview complaint when he said that “the child herself in the interviews does not give evidence of what exactly was said in the complaint”. It may not have been entirely accurate of the Crown Prosecutor then to say that the complainant “simply says that she told her mother something”, since the complainant told her mother that Mark did try to rape her, but it was correct that the interview complaint did not go into any detail of what the appellant had done. Counsel for the appellant can not have been unaware that evidence of the interview complaint was before the jury. That it was intended that that evidence should remain before the jury is powerfully confirmed by the judge’s reference to it in his summing-up, and the absence of comment or objection by the Crown or counsel for the appellant.  
     
      
    48 The appellant then submitted that, contrary to the position ultimately accepted at the trial, the cross-examination upon which his counsel embarked was not precluded by s 293 of the Criminal Procedure Act; or at least that, so far as it was prohibited by s 293(3), the exception in s 293(6) had been available to him. As has been seen, at the trial no application was made by counsel for the appellant for a ruling that he had a right to cross-examine under s 293(6). 
     
      
    49 In the consideration of this submission it should be noted that the cross-examination put distinct matters to the complainant, namely - 
     
      
       
      (a) that she had said to her brother “Daddy will rape you”; 
       
       
      (b) that her mother had said to her “You shouldn’t say things like that about your dad, you’ll put him in gaol if you say things like that”; and 
       
       
      (c) whether she had told anyone else that her dad had touched her in the genital area. 
       
      
    50 That (a) or (b) would fall within s 293(3) is debateable. The Crown Prosecutor considered that they would, hence he was not going to lead evidence of them from the complainant’s mother. Counsel for the appellant came to agree, specifically as to (a) but less clearly as to (b). It seems that counsel for the appellant considered that (a) implied touching of the complainant by her dad in the genital area – no other basis for counsel moving on to (c) is evident.  
     
      
    51 If it were necessary to decide, I do not think that (a) disclosed or implied that the complainant had or may have had sexual experience or a lack of sexual experience, or had or may have taken part or not taken part in any sexual activity. There was sexual knowledge of rape, and conceivably implication that daddy had raped someone, but the step to implication of rape of the complainant is a large one and I do not think it should be taken. M v R, which was followed in R v Bernthaler, does not in my view require taking the step. The evidence there in question was evidence that the complainant had told the accused that her father and brothers were having sexual intercourse with her. Counsel’s purpose in that case was to establish that the complainant was a “fantasiser”. It was held that the evidence was within the proscription of the then equivalent of s 293(3), and that even if the evidence as a whole would have shown fantasising it was proscribed because it disclosed or implied lack of sexual activity. The evidence in question was much more direct than (a) in the present case. As for (b), it followed on from (a) and did not independently infringe the proscription in s 293. 
     
      
    52 Although at first contending without discrimination that all of (a), (b) and (c) were not caught by s 293, the appellant eventually accepted in the appeal that (c) fell within s 293(3). It plainly did, and if (as may have been the case) counsel for the appellant had intended to suggest that the complainant was fantasising about sexual assault on the part of her father and also on the part of the appellant, it was not open to lay that foundation. But (a), and (b) as a follow-on, were at least arguably caught by s 293, on an available understanding of disclosure or implication, notwithstanding what I have said in the preceding paragraph. It was not irrational that counsel for the appellant came to accept that they were. The judge was not required to rule on the matter. He expressed a view, but he invited further argument from counsel for the appellant. Counsel for the appellant considered the matter and conceded the point; he and the Crown Prosecutor came to a common position and agreed upon its implementation, and there was no occasion for the judge to make a ruling either to establish the position or to impose some other position. 
     
      
    53 Nothing in this “handling of the aspects of complaint” prevented counsel for the appellant from putting to the complainant or in his address to the jury that the interview complaint was in response to a leading question; the interview complaint was no less so than the statement complaint. The further object of counsel for the appellant was not made clear at the time. It was submitted in the appeal that the prejudice to the appellant was inability to bring out how reference to getting the complainant’s dad into trouble might have caused the complainant to fabricate allegations against the appellant, in order to get him into trouble; that does not seem to have been counsel’s purpose, but if there was a basis for putting that the complainant disliked the appellant and wanted to get the appellant into trouble, or was influenced by her mother to want to do so, and so fabricated the allegations against the appellant, that was still open to counsel for the appellant. It may be noted, see later as to ground 9, that no such thing was put to the mother. Putting (c) to the complainant indicates a purpose of suggesting that the complainant fantasised about sexual activity on the part of her dad and did the same as to the allegations against the appellant, but this would effectively be precluded by s 293(3): M v R.  
     
      
    54 There was no miscarriage of justice in counsel for the appellant acting on the correct view that (c) was inadmissible. Where counsel for the appellant came to the view, which can not be regarded as irrational, that s 293 made (a) and (b) inadmissible, and acted on that view in the exclusion of the evidence his questions had brought out and in not pursuing his line of cross-examination, again I do not think that there was a basis for a miscarriage of justice. In the course of the trial it fell to counsel for the appellant to make many decisions, including deciding what matters he could and should object to or pursue in cross-examination of the complainant. He did so in relation to complaint. If fabrication in order to get the appellant into trouble was in his mind, he could have pursued it, but it is understandable that he decided not to pursue it, and decided (correctly) that pursuit of fantasising was effectively precluded, and so left complaint alone rather than highlight it in the jury’s minds. 
     
      
    55 As I have indicated, the appellant’s submissions included that the exception in s 293(6) had been available to him. It is improbable that counsel for the appellant failed to consider s 293(6) at the time. Perhaps counsel thought that the precondition in s 293(6)(a) would not be made out, satisfaction that it had been disclosed or implied in the case for the prosecution that the complainant had or may have had or not had sexual experience, or taken part or not taken part in sexual activity, within the meaning of the paragraph. Save so far as the interview complaint may have done so, in the evidence to the time of cross-examination of the complainant no such disclosure or implication is evident; it is not necessary to reach a final conclusion on whether “in the case for the prosecution” goes beyond the evidence led in the prosecution case, but it would be odd if it extended to (for example) material in statements such as the statement complaint which it came to be known the prosecution did not propose to lead. Perhaps counsel thought that the precondition in s 293(6)(b) would not be made out, satisfaction as to unfair prejudice to the complainant - and it may be noted that the prejudice must be from inability to cross-examine in relation to the disclosure or implication, perhaps indicating that the disclosure or implication was in material deployed in the prosecution case. This is not an occasion to explore the meaning and application of s 293(6), particularly when the appellant did little more than assert its availability. Whether or not to apply for a ruling that he had a right to cross-examine under s 293(6) was another of the decisions to be made by counsel for the appellant. It is understandable that he decided that application should not be made, and again there was not a basis for a miscarriage of justice. 
     
      
    56 Although not so put, the appellant’s submissions could more correctly have been to the effect that there was a miscarriage of justice because, within the principles more fully discussed when I come to grounds 5 and 11A, his counsel so conducted his defence in relation to complaint that a fairly open chance of acquittal was lost. If the submissions had been so put, counsel’s conduct would have lain in the ultimate acceptance that s 293 precluded the cross-examination on which he had embarked, in failure to invoke s 293(6), and permitting the situation of part of the material concerning complaint, rather than all or none of it, being before the jury.  
     
      
    57 Grounds 5 and 11A were confined to the conduct of counsel in relation to the appellant giving evidence. If ground 1 had been presented within the principles there discussed, I do not think there was a miscarriage of justice. The course taken by counsel for the appellant, given the undoubted inadmissibility of (c) and the debateable admissibility of (a) and (b), was on an objective assessment a rational course of avoiding highlighting complaint and concentrating, as counsel did, on inconsistencies and improbabilities in the evidence of a young girl, and I am not satisfied that it resulted in loss of a fairly open chance of acquittal. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2: “Admissions” 
       
      
    58 The appellant submitted that, although the letters were admitted only as relationship evidence, they would have been so prejudicial to him that no matter what directions were given, and without any explanation by him, he had no real chance of acquittal; in particular, it was said, the letters could have detracted from careful analysis of the complainant’s evidence of the specific occasions of sexual assault charged against the appellant. The submission was curious, in that an integer of the prejudice was the appellant’s failure to give evidence explaining the letters, which can hardly be a matter of which the judge could properly take account; however, that can be passed over. It was submitted that, although counsel for the appellant did not object to the letters or ask the judge to exercise an excluding discretion, the letters should have been excluded in the exercise of the discretion in s 138 of the Evidence Act, so identified but plainly enough meaning s 137, because their probative value was outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the appellant.  
     
      
    59 Section 137 provides - 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        137 Exclusion of prejudicial evidence in criminal proceedings 
         
         
        In a criminal proceeding, the court must refuse to admit evidence adduced by the prosecutor if its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant.” 
        
       
      
    60 In contrast with s 135, which provides that a court may refuse to admit evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger (inter alia) that the evidence might be unfairly prejudicial to a party, under s 137 the court must refuse to admit the evidence. In R v Blick [2000] NSWCCA 61 it was pointed out that s 137 did not involve the exercise of a discretion, but rather a weighing exercise as a matter of “opinion based on a variety of circumstances, the evidence, the particulars of the case and the judge’s own trial experience”; although the judgment produced by the process was, for appellate review, analogous to the exercise of a judicial discretion (at [19]-[20]). If the probative value of the evidence is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the accused, however, there is no residual discretion (at [20]). 
     
      
    61 The appellant’s description of the letters as relationship evidence was not controverted, indeed was implicitly accepted, by the Crown. That is an imprecise label, and in order to address exclusion of the letters upon a s 137 judgment it is necessary better to understand the basis for their admission. 
     
      
    62 At common law evidence of uncharged sexual conduct between the accused and the complainant has long been admitted, as evidence relevant to place the offences alleged in their context and enable proper evaluation by the jury, and to show a “guilty passion” (better described as sexual desire or feeling of the accused for the complainant): R v Wickham (CCA, 17 December 1991, unreported); R v Beserick (1993) 30 NSWLR 510 at 515; R v AH (1997) 42 NSWLR 702 at 708. 
     
      
    63 Account must now be taken of the exclusionary rule in ss 97 and 101 of the Evidence Act. Tendency evidence, relevantly evidence of the conduct of a person tending to prove that the person had a tendency to act in a particular way, is (subject to some exceptions) not admissible to prove that tendency if requisite notice has not been given (s 97(1)(a)) or if “the court thinks that the evidence would not, either by itself or having regard to other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the party seeking to adduce the evidence, have significant probative value” (s 97(1)(b)). In criminal proceedings, tendency evidence about a defendant that is adduced by the prosecution cannot be used against the defendant unless - 
     
      
       
        
        “ … the court thinks that the evidence would not, either by itself or having regard to other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the party seeking to adduce the evidence, have significant probative value.” (s 101(2)) 
        
       
      
    64 Evidence of a “guilty passion” has been regarded as tendency evidence, so that where the relationship evidence is not introduced only to provide context and background, but is directed to the accused’s sexual desire or feelings and through them the likelihood that the charged sexual conduct occurred, ss 97 and 101 of the Evidence Act come into play: R v AH at 708-9; R v Greenham [1999] NSWCCA 8 at [23]; Qualtieri v R [2006] NSWCCA 95 at [74].  
     
      
    65 There are difficulties in these bases for the admission of so-called relationship evidence, which has more recently come into question. The matter was discussed in Gipp v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 106. In R v Fraser (10 August 1998, unreported) this Court (Mason P, Wood CJ at CL and Sperling J) analysed the views expressed in Gipp v The Queen, concluding at [29] that a clear ratio could not be extracted and that until the High Court decided otherwise the law as laid down in R v Wickham, R v Beserick and R v AH should continued to be applied. The matter has since arisen in the High Court, see KRM v The Queen (2001) 206 CLR 221 and Tully v The Queen (2006) 81 ALJR 391, but the High Court has not yet decided otherwise. 
     
      
    66 Evidence of uncharged sexual conduct may be given by the complainant. Possibly it could be given by a third party observer, or it could be by way of admission by the accused. In R v Wickham evidence of the accused’s admission to a police officer of earlier sexual activities with the complainant was held to be admissible “for the same reasons as” the complainant’s evidence of uncharged sexual conduct. The evidence will ordinarily be of sexual conduct on particular occasions, necessarily occasions other than those of the charged sexual conduct.  
     
      
    67 Where the evidence is by way of admission by the accused of sexual activities with the complainant, and is not attributed to particular occasions being occasions other than those of the charged sexual conduct, in my view an additional relevance can arise. Such an admission that the accused engaged in sexual conduct with the complainant, whilst non-specific as to the charged sexual conduct and not of itself sufficient to prove that conduct, is relevant not on the bases of context and background and of “guilty passion” earlier mentioned, but because when taken with other evidence the jury could regard it as relating to or at least encompassing the charged sexual conduct and supporting that the charged sexual conduct occurred. If accepted, it could rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the conduct charged against the accused (see Evidence Act, s 55). It will, of course, require an assessment of the admission, understood in its own context; for example, marked generality may mean that the admission can not properly be taken to encompass the charged conduct. 
     
      
    68 This can be illustrated from a case not involving sexual conduct, R v Centraco [2005] NSWCCA 11. Centraco was charged on three counts of obtaining money or a financial advantage by deception, by cashing cheques drawn on her employer’s bank account without authority and receiving payment of cheques drawn on the bank account and other payments deposited into her own bank account without authority. She acknowledged in a statutory declaration owing “approximately $150,000” to her employer, which was a little less than half the amount the subject of the charges, and undertook to pay it back. Was the statutory declaration admissible? 
     
      
    69 Hidden J, with whom Howie and Hislop JJ agreed, said - 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        [15] 
          
        In exchanges with the Bench in the course of argument, several possible bases of admission of the statutory declaration were canvassed. However, in my view, the simple answer to the problem is that argued by the Crown Prosecutor in this Court. In every trial of an accused on a number of counts it is necessary that each count be considered separately, but it is likely that there will be some evidence which is common to some or all of them. In the present case evidence that the appellant acknowledged indebtedness to her employer in the circumstances alleged by the Crown was relevant to all three counts. Particularly was this so given that the Crown case alleged a pattern of dishonesty over an extended period of time, the three counts merely representing the different methods employed. The evidence was available as an admission of a fact relevant to each of the counts although, of course, it could not have been determinative of any of them. Whether the amount of the acknowledged indebtedness corresponded with the amounts the subject of any one or more of the counts is not to the point. In that regard, it should be remembered that, even on the Crown case, the statutory declaration was made out before the appellant's alleged defalcations had been formally investigated, at a time when the full extent of them might not have been known. 
         
         
        [16] 
          
        From the passage of the summing up quoted above it is apparent that this is precisely how the evidence was left to the jury. In particular, his Honour explained that it was relied upon by the Crown as a ""general admission"" in respect of the three charges, that it did not relate to any particular charge and that, of itself, it was incapable of proving any of them. Earlier in the summing up he had given an appropriate, indeed emphatic, direction about the need for separate consideration of each of the three counts. The statutory declaration was admissible for the reasons explained to the jury by his Honour and it does not appear to me that there was any danger of the jury using it impermissibly as tendency evidence.” 
         
        
       
      
    70 In R v Hagarty (2004) 145 A Crim R 138 the complainant’s father gave evidence that the accused admitted to sexual molestation of the complainant. This was treated as relationship evidence led not as tendency evidence, with approval of a direction that the admission could be used “as corroborating or backing up [the complainant’s] evidence that there was an improper sexual relationship between herself and the accused”. In my view, the label of relationship evidence is better avoided, and the evidence had independent relevance for the reasons last described. 
     
      
    71 In the present case the letters were relevant as evidence which, while not determinative of the particular aggravated indecent assault at Numbugga the subject of count 1 or specifically any other of the ten counts, could support the occurrence of the conduct charged in those counts. They were in a different position from evidence of sexual conduct on an occasion other than those charged, tendered to provide context and background or reveal sexual desire or feeling. They could have been tendered for one or other, or both, of those purposes. The appellant’s admissions did more, and could be tendered as what Hidden J described as “a general admission” in respect of all the charges. 
     
      
    72 That appears to have been how the letters were tendered at the trial. The complainant’s evidence of uncharged sexual conduct was tendered as providing context. The letters were tendered, in the Crown Prosecutor’s words to the judge next set out, as “corroborative evidence of the complainant’s testament”. Since a similar question arises as to the Weerawardena evidence, for convenience in the following paragraphs I address the tender of both the letters and the Weerawardena evidence. 
     
      
    73 After the jury was empanelled the Crown Prosecutor informed the judge in their absence - 
     
      
       
        
        “CROWN PROSECUTOR: The Crown case involves two pieces of evidence in particular in addition to the complainant’s interviews. They are, firstly, the evidence of the minister of the Christian Church by the name of Ian Weerawardena from Victoria. That evidence, in a nutshell your Honour, is of the person Mr Weerawardena having a meeting with the accused in June 2001 where he puts to him that he has been informed that [the mother’s] child has been molested by the accused and he wants to know the truth of the matter, to which the accused nods his head in agreement when it is put to him did he molest the child. 
        
       
       
        
        The second area of evidence is a series of four letters that the accused wrote to the mother of [the complainant] in a period stretching from 11 June 2001, in fact starting prior to that but the ones of interest to the Crown are for 11 June 2001 till 1 April 2002. In those letters there are passages which the Crown says amounts to an acknowledgment of sexually improper behaviour and the complainant is referred to in at least one of those letters, or in fact in two of those letters, and the Crown says that that evidence is not admissible as to specific counts but, rather, it is corroborative evidence of the complainant’s testament. 
        
       
       
        
        Again, your Honour, it has been indicated to me by my friend that there is no objection to that evidence and I indicate that on the record your Honour because I intend to open on it. 
        
       
       
        
        They are the matters that I indicate to your Honour at this stage.” 
        
       
      
    74 In his opening address the Crown Prosecutor outlined evidence to be heard from Mr Weerawardena and read passages from the letters. He said that the evidence was important, but did not otherwise explain its relevance. 
     
      
    75 Later in his opening address the Crown Prosecutor said - 
     
      
       
        
        “The final thing I want to tell you about is this, and his Honour will have much more to say to you about it later, you’ll hear when you listen to the tapes of the child’s evidence, or the tapes of her interview with the police, you’ll hear her talk about a number of other things that happened of a sexual nature between her and the accused which, if you look at the indictment, well they don’t appear as charges on the indictment. The prosecution puts that evidence before you as what we call relationship or context, that is these weren’t ten incidents that happened out of the blue, they happened in a context of a relationship in that sense between the accused and [the complainant] where this type of activity was happening very frequently. So it’s lead for you to be able to understand the context in which these particular charges are before you and so you understand how they come about. But you can’t use that evidence as proof if you find it happened, as proof of these individual charges. As I said his Honour will tell you much more and give you directions about that evidence at a later date.”;  
        
       
      
    76 In this opening the letters and the Weerawardena evidence were treated differently from the complainant’s evidence of uncharged sexual conduct. The latter was treated as relationship evidence; the letters and the Weerawardena evidence were not.  
     
      
    77 For such light as it sheds on the tender of the letters and the Weerawardena evidence, in his address to the jury after the conclusion of evidence the Crown Prosecutor also treated separately with the uncharged sexual conduct in the audio tapes and the letters. 
     
      
    78 At an early point the Crown Prosecutor said - 
     
      
       
        
        “Ladies and gentlemen you also heard evidence on those interviews that lots of other things happened. You remember there was touching with the hand alleged. There were many more times according to [the complainant] when incidents such as forcing her to masturbate him occurred, and you remember I said to you at the beginning of this trial about that evidence, it doesn’t relate to any of the charges, and you can’t use, even if you’re satisfied that those other things occurred, you can’t use that material to prove or to be satisfied that he committed these counts on the indictment. What that evidence there is ladies and gentlemen is to show the context in which all of these counts in the indictment happened. 
        
       
       
        
        Let’s suppose ladies and gentlemen that there are only two counts in the indictment and not 10, and this young girl were to say to you that her stepfather had licked her vagina on one occasion and put his penis in her mouth on another occasion. You might be entitled to think my goodness, out of the blue where did this come from? It would seem to you perhaps very odd that these isolated incidents happened. But what this other evidence goes to show ladies and gentlemen is to put into context the 10 charges and to say well look this isn’t all that [the complainant] says happened. They weren’t just 10 isolated incidents that happened, it was a whole context of a whole relationship between them involving numerous episodes of this type of sexual impropriety, and that’s the basis on which that evidence is put before you.” 
        
       
      
    79 Later in his address the Crown Prosecutor said that the complainant’s evidence “doesn’t stand alone”, and a little later that “the real reason in my submission or the real strength in my submission to you that you can accept what [the complainant] says happened comes with Reverend Weerawardena and with the letters, and I now turn to look at those”. 
     
      
    80 The Crown Prosecutor addressed on the Weerawardena evidence, describing it as admissions not of specific charges on the indictment or specific counts but of sexual impropriety with the complainant. He then addressed on the letters, asking the jury to “look carefully at these letters and focus on what the accused particularly says about [the complainant]”, and said - 
     
      
       
        
        “Ladies and gentlemen, in the accused’s own words he admits to [the claimant’s mother] and to you that he’s been engaged in sexual impropriety. If you put what he said to Mr Weerawardena together with what he said in the letters there can be no doubt ladies and gentlemen that he was engaged in a sexual relationship with [the complainant] and had committed sexual impropriety. But that does not prove each of those counts on the indictment. The effect of that evidence ladies and gentlemen is to corroborate or to strengthen, to support the credibility of [the complainant] when she talks to you about there being this context or this relationship of sexual impropriety going on, and in my submission to you helps you in terms of her credit, that is how much you believe her, helps you to assess her as being credible when she talks to you about those individual things that happened as described in the indictment.” 
        
       
      
    81 The appellant did not submit that the letters were irrelevant, or that they were inadmissible apart from exclusion by reason of a s 137 judgment. Nor was it submitted that the judge had erred in his directions to the jury as to the proper use which could be made of the letters, or had failed appropriately to direct the jury that each of the specific occasions of sexual assault had to be proved beyond reasonable doubt. The appellant did not raise an exclusionary rule for tendency evidence, relying only on exclusion under s 137 of the Evidence Act. The Crown’s written submissions expressly asserted that the letters were “not tendered as tendency evidence and therefore did not have to meet the tests of s 97 and s 101 of the Evidence Act”. The appellant did not contend to the contrary.  
     
      
    82 The question under ground 2 was whether there was a miscarriage of justice because the letters were not excluded by reason of a s 137 judgment. In answering the question, relevance as “guilty passion” evidence did not arise at the trial. The letters were admissible because relevant not only to provide context, so far as they did so. They were admissible for their independent relevance as admissions of sexual conduct with the complainant. 
     
      
    83 Rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules provides - 
     
      
       
        
        “4. No direction, omission to direct, or decision as to the admission or rejection of evidence given by the Judge presiding at the trial, shall, without the leave of the Court, be allowed as a ground for appeal or an application for leave to appeal unless objection was taken at the trial to the direction, omission, or decision by the party appealing or applying for leave to appeal.” 
        
       
      
    84 As I have noted, counsel for the appellant did not ask the judge to exclude the letters, and leave is required.  
     
      
    85 In R v Button [2002] NSWCCA 159 (reported but not as to this at (2002) 54 NSWLR 455) Heydon JA, with whom Greg James and Kirby JJ agreed, said - 
     
      
       
        
        “32 In  
        R v Abusafiah  
        (1991) 24 NSWLR 531 at 536 Hunt CJ at CL said:  
         
         
          
          ‘The requirements of r 4 of the  
          Criminal Appeal Rules 
           do not constitute some mere technicality which may simply be brushed aside. One purpose of the requirement that no misdirection or non direction may, without leave, be allowed as a ground of appeal unless objection was taken at the trial is to ensure that the trial judge receives the assistance from counsel to which he or she is entitled in the task of giving appropriate directions to the jury. If a summing-up contains some error which could easily have been cured once the judge’s attention had been drawn to it, and if counsel for the accused to whose detriment the error operates fails to comply with his or her duty to draw the judge’s attention to that error ( 
          R v Knight 
          , Court of Criminal Appeal, 18 December 1990, unreported at 46), any suggestion that such detriment automatically entitles the accused to a new trial does not strike a sympathetic chord in the hearts of those who see the right to a fair trial as operating in favour not only of the accused but also of the Crown, which prosecutes on behalf of the whole community. The  
          Criminal Appeal Act 
           1912 does not exist to enable an accused who has been convicted under one set of issues to have a new trial under a new set of issues which he could and should have raised at the first trial. There are, of course, cases in which the error made is of such a nature that, notwithstanding the failure of counsel for the accused to comply with that duty, leave will be granted to avoid a miscarriage of justice.’ 
           
          
         
        33 In  
        R v Sanderson 
         (CCA, 18 July 1994, unreported, pages 7-8) Gleeson CJ said:  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
          
          ‘This case provides a striking and clear illustration of the reason for the presence in the Criminal Appeal Rules of rule 4. If trial counsel had apprehended that there was any significant risk that the jury might have misunderstood the true nature of their function in relation to this matter of corroboration, then the point was available to be taken by trial counsel. If the point had been taken, and if there really had been a problem, it was a problem that was capable of simple correction. It would ordinarily be quite inappropriate to permit appellants, in such circumstances, to come to the Court of Criminal Appeal and complain that a miscarriage of justice has occurred.’ 
           
          
         
        34 In  
        R v DH 
         [2000] NSWCCA 360 at [115] Stein JA (Smart and Ireland AJJ concurring) referred with approval to what Mahoney JA said in  
        R v Jeffrey  
        (CCA, 16 December 1993). At pages 6-7, Mahoney JA said of the principle embodied in r 4:  
         
         
          
          ‘In my opinion, this principle plays an important part in the criminal trial process. It is important that any objection to the summing-up or that any defect or omission at the trial which can be cured or mitigated by steps taken at the trial, be raised at the time of the trial. The judge should be asked to, and should have the opportunity to, correct any error or deficiency of this kind. … But it is important that, if a citizen is to be tried, he be tried once and for all. The evil both of objections ‘held in reserve’ and raised only on appeal and of second and subsequent trials is great. 
           
           
          Errors will occur and r 4 provides for them. But unless there be a convincing reason why the matter was not raised at the trial and unless the possibility of real injustice appears, an accused should be held to what was done by or for him at trial level. Not infrequently this Court is asked to act under r 4 when the reason why the defect was not dealt with at the trial has not been established and where it is at least possible that there were tactical reasons why it was not. It is not easy for the court on appeal to satisfy itself that the reason why the matter was not raised was error rather than choice. In such circumstances, the court should be slow to act under r 4. In the end, the court must exercise the power given to it by r 4 according to the merits of the individual case. However, in my opinion, in exercising that power, the court should keep steadily in mind the function which r 4 performs in the criminal trial process’.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    86 Heydon JA then cited part of para [72] from the judgment of McHugh J in Papakosmas v The Queen (1999) 196 CLR 297 at 319. A more full citation is - 
     
      
       
        
        “[72] There is no case for the grant of leave under r 4 unless the Court of Criminal Appeal is satisfied that the appellant has an arguable case that the trial judge has made an error of law or is satisfied that the appellant's conviction is otherwise a miscarriage of justice. Satisfying the Court that there is an arguable case is extremely difficult where the appellant has failed to object to evidence or failed to ask for a direction concerning evidence. In such cases, the trial judge has made no error of law because he or she has not been asked for a ruling. Consequently, an appeal can only succeed if the Court of Criminal Appeal is satisfied that the admission of the evidence or the failure to give the direction has caused a miscarriage of justice, proof of which lies on the appellant. Where the evidence was admissible, but the trial judge had a discretion to limit its use, the burden on the appellant is greater: the appeal can succeed only if the Court of Criminal Appeal is satisfied that the discretion would have been exercised in favour of the appellant and that, if it had, it is more likely than not that the appellant would have been acquitted. Any other view would mean that there was always a miscarriage of justice when the trial judge might have exercised a discretion in favour of the appellant.  
        
       
       
        
        [73] Whatever else may be said about this case, it is not reasonably arguable that the trial judge must have exercised his discretion in favour of limiting the evidence and that the failure to do so has probably resulted in the appellant being wrongly convicted. That being so, the Court of Criminal Appeal should have refused to give leave to argue the point.” 
        
       
      
    87 Accordingly it must be asked whether, although the judge was not asked to exclude the letters pursuant to s 137, this Court is satisfied that the judge must have excluded them if asked; and if that is so, there is a second question, whether the failure to exclude them probably resulted in the appellant being wrongly convicted. 
     
      
    88 It is well recognised that so-called relationship evidence carries the danger of misuse as propensity evidence, or now tendency evidence, and that evidence of a sexual relationship beyond the charged conduct may considerably influence the jury’s verdict. So the purpose of the tender of such evidence should be identified, and ss 97 and 101 of the Evidence Act and any exclusionary rule or discretion may arise. If the evidence is admitted, the jury must be carefully directed as to the use which they may make of the evidence: see recently Qualtieri v R at [72]-[81] per McClellan CJ at CL, with whom Howie and Latham JJ agreed. There was a like danger in the tender of the letters, but in weighing probative value and the danger of unfair prejudice to the appellant the probative value of the letters went beyond providing context in the manner ascribed to relationship evidence. 
     
      
    89 In my opinion, the answer to the first question is no. The letters had significant probative value, going well beyond perhaps limited probative value if only tendered to provide context or background. The judge could well have considered that, with proper directions to the jury as to the use they could make of the letters and directions that the jury had to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the complainant’s evidence of the particular conduct charged against the appellant should be accepted, their probative value was not outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the appellant. Indeed, in my opinion the prospect of the judge excluding the letters upon a s 137 judgment was remote; that could well be why counsel for the appellant, responsibly addressing the conduct of the defence, did not object to the letters or ask the judge to exclude them. 
     
      
       
      Ground 3: “Confession” 
       
      
    90 The appellant’s written submissions were directed only to the first Weerawardena evidence, the evidence about the appellant nodding his head in acknowledgement that he had lied to Mr Weerawardena. It was submitted first, that it was not clear whether the nodding acknowledged more than lying or, if it did, what was the nature and extent of the abuse acknowledged; and secondly, that in any event as relationship evidence the effect, without explanation from the appellant, was so prejudicial that the appellant had “no chance of a fair and impartial trial”.  
     
      
    91 The oral submissions appeared to extend the second of these submissions to the second Weerawardena evidence. As I have noted, objection was taken to that evidence.  
     
      
    92 In the reasons for his ruling as to the second Weerawardena evidence the judge recorded that the application was made pursuant to s 90 of the Evidence Act, which permits exclusion of evidence of an admission if, having regard to the circumstances in which it was made, it would be unfair to the accused to use the evidence. His Honour recorded that the application was on the ground that the appellant “had come under great pressure from the minister to repent in a way which disclosed all of his misdeeds rather than not disclosing all of them”.  
     
      
    93 His Honour noted that the Crown pointed out that “this was the second occasion rather than the first”, no doubt adverting to the occasion of what I have called the first Weerawardena evidence. The judge continued, referring to the occasion of the second Weerawardena evidence - 
     
      
       
        
        “In particular, the accused produced a document of a legal nature referring to proceedings and the witness informed him that if there was a court order and the police wanted him to appear he would say what he was told. 
         
         
        It seems to me that is a critical matter in the determination of the issue in this matter and in the circumstances, having considered the various aspects, that seems to me to tilt the balance in favour of permitting the evidence and rejecting the submission that it would be unfair to the accused to use the evidence and I hold accordingly.” 
        
       
      
    94 Again, it was not said on appeal that the Weerawardena evidence was not relevant or, subject to the exercise of an excluding discretion, not admissible. The appellant’s submissions did not meaningfully address the judge’s reasons for declining to exclude the second Weerawardena evidence, but should be taken to have included that the judge erred in the exercise of his discretion. They were otherwise, as with the letters, that the Weerawardena evidence should have been excluded pursuant to s 137 of the Evidence Act because its probative value was outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the appellant. 
     
      
    95 I can see no error in the judge’s exercise of the discretion under s 90 of the Evidence Act. It was not clear what document was shown by the appellant to Mr Weerawardena, but it is evident that he knew that child abuse had been alleged against him. He was told by Mr Weerawardena, referring to the earlier occasion, that “all what you said to me I will tell the law”. There was thus no question of confidentiality, and whatever pastoral influences may have been working upon the appellant he could have been in no doubt that whatever he said to Mr Weerawardena on the occasion of the second Weerawardena evidence could also be told to the law. He nonetheless made to Mr Weerawardena the statements on which the Crown relied. It was entirely open to the judge to rule that, in the circumstances in which the appellant said what he said to Mr Weerawardena, it would not be unfair to him to use the evidence. Indeed, any other ruling would hardly have been open; and if, as on one view is the case, it is for this Court to form its own view as to unfairness rather than review a discretionary decision, I am satisfied that there was not unfairness. 
     
      
    96 As to the Weerawardena evidence and s 137 of the Evidence Act, the position is very similar to that of the letters. The judge was not asked to exclude the evidence pursuant to s 137. I have described the way the Weerawardena evidence was tendered at the trial. It was for the jury to consider what the nodding acknowledged, and in my opinion it was well open to them to consider that it was more than lying and was acknowledgment of sexual misconduct with the complainant. The Weerawardena evidence was no less probative than the letters, perhaps entitled to greater weight because more directly admitting sexual impropriety. Without repetition, I am not satisfied that the judge must have excluded the Weerawardena evidence if asked. 
     
      
       
      Grounds 5 and 11A 
       
      
    97 I will come to grounds 5 and 11A after consideration of the unreasonable verdicts grounds. 
     
      
       
      Ground 6: “Inconsistencies of Opportunity” 
       
      Ground 8: “Lies of Complainant” 
       
      Ground 9: “Motives of Mother” 
       
      Ground 10: “Influence of Pornography” 
       
      Ground 11: “Whole of Evidence” 
       
      
    98 These grounds were related, grounds 6, 8, 9 and 10 being the particular matters which the Court was invited to “put together” for ground 11. They rested on s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 so far as it provided for allowing an appeal if the Court - 
     
      
       
        
        “ … is of opinion that the verdict of the jury should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable, or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence … or that on any other ground whatsoever there was a miscarriage of justice.” 
        
       
      
    99 In MFA v The Queen (2002) 213 CLR 606 the High Court embraced the exposition of s 6(1) in the joint judgment of Mason CJ and Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ in M v The Queen (1994) 191 CLR 487: see per Gleeson CJ, Hayne and Callinan JJ at [25] and per McHugh, Gummow and Kirby JJ at [59].  
     
      
    100 In M v The Queen their Honours said at 493 - 
     
      
       
        
        “Where, notwithstanding that as a matter of law there is evidence to sustain a verdict, a court of criminal appeal is asked to conclude that the verdict is unsafe or unsatisfactory, the question which the court must ask itself is whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty. But in answering that question the court must not disregard or discount either the consideration that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, or the consideration that the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses. On the contrary, the court must pay full regard to those considerations.” (citations omitted) 
        
       
      
    101 Of reference to reasonable doubt in the mind of the Court, they said at 494-5 - 
     
      
       
        
        “But it is, we think, possible to make too much both of the view expressed by Barwick CJ and of the qualification suggested. In most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced. It is only where a jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a court of criminal appeal that the court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred. That is to say, where the evidence lacks credibility for reasons which are not explained by the manner in which it was given, a reasonable doubt experienced by the court is a doubt which a reasonable jury ought to have experienced. If the evidence, upon the record itself, contains discrepancies, displays inadequacies, is tainted or otherwise lacks probative force in such a way as to lead the court of criminal appeal to conclude that, even making full allowance for the advantages enjoyed by the jury, there is a significant possibility that an innocent person has been convicted, then the court is bound to act and to set aside a verdict based upon that evidence. In doing so, the court is not substituting trial by a court of appeal for trial by jury, for the ultimate question must always be whether the court thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty.” (citation omitted) 
        
       
      
    102 In MFA v The Queen McHugh, Gummow and Kirby JJ said of this elaboration of s 6(1) - 
     
      
       
        
        “[59] … Ultimately, the additional formulations exist only to assist courts of criminal appeal to discharge their statutory functions. Those functions are stated, relevantly, in s 6(1) of the Act. In the end, that sub-section is designed to afford a mechanism against a prospect that our community and its courts continue to regard as intolerable, namely that an innocent person has been wrongly convicted upon unreasonable and unsupported evidence and has thereby suffered a miscarriage of justice. The interpretation and application of the sub-section must always keep that purpose in mind. But it involves a function to be performed within a legal system that accords special respect and legitimacy to jury verdicts deciding contested factual questions concerning the guilt of the accused in serious criminal trials.” (citation omitted) 
        
       
      
    103 I will further explain each of the grounds, before considering whether unreasonableness of the verdicts has been made out. 
     
      
       
      (a) Inconsistencies of opportunity 
       
      
    104 From the appellant’s submissions, by “inconsistencies of opportunity” was meant that the complainant’s evidence lacked credibility: first, because of discrepancies as to the presence of the complainant’s mother, and secondly, because it was unlikely that the appellant would have committed the sexual assaults upon the complainant when her mother and others were nearby and might see what was occurring.  
     
      
    105 In the recorded interview of 30 May 2001 the complainant said, speaking generally of what the appellant had done, that he had “been trying to sex me” and - 
     
      
       
        
        “And he used to do it when Mum went out to prayer group at night or she went to work at night. She went to work in the day and the first time he did it was in Numbugga.” 
        
       
      
    106 The appellant submitted that this was not consistent with the complainant’s evidence that, as to at least some of the particular sexual assaults charged against him, her mother was in the vicinity. In the case of other of the counts the complainant’s evidence was that her mother was at work, and for others again her evidence did not indicate where the mother was.  
     
      
    107 On the complainant’s evidence as to count 3, when the appellant put her on the top bunk in her sleeping area and licked her vagina (at one point said to be for about five minutes and at another about ten minutes) her mother was in the tent towelling her brother dry. In the recorded interview the complainant said that her brother was in the sleeping area at the time, but later that he was in the tent, and in cross-examination she said that her recorded interview was incorrect in that respect and she thought, without being completely sure, that her brother was in the tent with her mother. For count 4, the sexual assault on the master bed in the shed, the complainant said in the recorded interview that her mother was asleep in the unfinished house and in cross-examination that she thought that her brother was somewhere in the shed. For counts 5, 6 and 7, acts alleged to have occurred in the master bedroom in the house, in the recorded interview the complainant said that her brother was in his (the brother’s) bedroom playing with friends. For count 8, she said that her brother was sitting on the floor watching television, in the same room as the appellant and the complainant: in the recorded interview she said that her brother did not see what happened because “he was too busy watching telly”. The appellant submitted that, particularly as to count 3, the risk of discovery from the nearby presence of the mother and others made it unlikely that the appellant would have acted as alleged, and cast fundamental doubt on acceptance of the complainant’s evidence. 
     
      
    108 Counsel for the appellant gave appropriate attention to this in his address to the jury, both in general (for example that “you might think somebody having an inappropriate [sexual activity] with a child is hardly going to happen when the child’s mother is in the home or about”), and with more focus. As to count 3 in particular, he said - 
     
      
       
        
        “You might say without being caught or without mum seeing her or anybody seeing her to be most unlikely. Again these acts are not done so one could get caught if they’re done and you’re talking about a very little she. You’re talking about, you’ve got photographs of it a double garage shed and the tent just outside the door and the roller shutter door up and mum is a matter of metres away, wherever she happens to be and the young boy is either in the bath or he’s in the bed or he’s somewhere. They’re all a matter of metres away and with it being so close together this sexual predator picks up this seven year old girl and shoves her on the top bunk of the bed and takes her pants off and licks her vagina. Is that a credible story that you could accept let alone how he would have even got there when she demonstrated lying flat on the bed? The story’s not credible you might think. ” 
        
       
       
      (b) Lies of complainant 
       
      
    109 In the recorded interview of 30 May 2001 the complainant said that, after the masturbation the subject of count 1, she pushed the appellant to make him let go, ran out of the room and hid in the wardrobe in her room, and the appellant pulled her back into his room and “made me do it again”. In her evidence in chief she said that this was not correct, that she walked to the door of the room and the appellant asked her to come back, which she did. She said - 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Why did you tell the police dealing firstly with pushing him, why did you tell the police that you pushed him? 
         
        A. Because in my head I’d imagined that I wanted to push him. I’d said it wrong. I wanted to push him but I didn’t dare do it, I didn’t dare do it. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Why did you tell the police that you ran to your room and hid? 
         
        A. Because I’d been scared at the time and I hadn’t really thought about it, I just thought, ‘No, he’s after me’ at the time. I kind of imagined things happening. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. When you say ‘scared at the time’ what time are you talking about? 
         
        A. The time that it actually happened. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What about saying that he went to your room and pulled you back into his room, why did you say that? 
         
        A. I also thought that was, I also kind of felt as if that was happening, it seemed like that but it wasn’t.” 
        
       
      
    110 In cross-examination the complainant agreed that what was in her recorded interview about leaving the room and hiding in her room was not true; when it was put to her that it was also not true that the appellant took her to his bedroom and put her hand on his penis, she said that it did happen. 
     
      
    111 The appellant also referred to a portion of the recorded interview of 17 December 2002 when the complainant said, “I’ve told lots of lies before”. That should be seen in context. The police officer was talking to the complainant about what it meant to tell the truth or to tell a lie. Examples of lies were identified, and the complainant volunteered, “I’ve told lots of lies before”. The recorded interview continued - 
     
      
       
        
        “Q38 Have you? Well we can’t tell any today. 
         
         
        A. I won’t. 
         
         
        Q39 OK you promise? 
         
         
        A. I promise 
         
         
        Q40 I promise too that I’ll only talk about the truth which is what’s really happened. So while we’re talking I don’t want you to make anything up at all. 
         
         
        A. I won’t.” 
        
       
      
    112 Although not expressly articulated, I take the submission to have been that the complainant admitted to lying both in general and as to one of the matters charged against the appellant, with doubt accordingly cast on her veracity. Counsel for the appellant also relied on the correction of the recorded interview in his address to the jury. 
     
      
       
      (c) Motives of mother 
       
      
    113 Again without being clearly articulated, in substance the appellant contended that the complainant’s mother might have exercised an influence over the complainant with a view to using charges against the appellant as a lever to help her obtain a transfer of matrimonial property. This is fanciful, and can immediately be put aside. The complainant’s mother went to the police within days of 17 May 2001. In mid-June 2001 Mr Weerawardena told the appellant to sign everything over to the complainant’s mother “without reservation and expectation of monetary compensation”, but the evidence did not support that the complainant’s mother had bargained for this, let alone attempted in some manner to bring charges against the appellant into the bargaining. It was not suggested in the cross-examination of the complainant’s mother that she had been motivated to influence the complainant in making the complaints, by this or anything else, or that she had influenced her. Nor was it suggested to the complainant that the complainant’s mother had influenced her to make the allegations against the appellant: the closest was the question, “Did anyone say to you that you’d need to say these things about Mark?”, to which she answered no. This should not have been part of the appeal. 
     
      
       
      (d) Influence of pornography 
       
      
    114 There was evidence that the appellant and the complainant’s mother viewed pornographic videos, and that on an occasion the complainant had seen part of what they were viewing; further, that the complainant had seen, at least to an extent, the appellant and the complainant’s mother engaging in sexual intercourse. In substance, it was contended that the complainant may thereby have gained knowledge of sexual activity which she used to fabricate allegations against the appellant.  
     
      
    115 On one occasion the complainant was seen on her top bunk looking over the top of her wardrobe at a pornographic video which the appellant and the complainant’s mother were watching. The complainant’s mother said “four or five men had masks on and there was a woman standing and she hadn’t taken off her clothes or anything and that’s when I had this feeling that someone was watching and I looked and then it went off”. The complainant had her bottom whacked and was put to bed on the bottom bunk, where she stayed. The complainant said in the record of interview of 30 May 2001 that she got into trouble “peeking at videos that Mum and Mark were watching” and had to sleep on the bottom bunk.  
     
      
    116 The evidence of the complainant seeing the appellant and the complainant’s mother engaged in sexual intercourse was of two occasions, once at Numbugga when the mother was “not able to say whether you were engaged in sexual activity at the time” and the other when there was sexual activity but under the bedclothes. The complainant was not asked about this. 
     
      
    117 I do not think that, singly or in combination, these matters meant that it was not open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was guilty. The isolated portion of the recorded interview could not properly be read as saying that the complainant’s mother was always out when the appellant was “trying to sex me”, let alone always out on the occasions the subject of the charges against the appellant, and taking the recorded interview as a whole it was entirely open to the jury not to understand it in that way. To the extent that there was some discrepancy, it was open to the jury not to attribute significance to it. There were considerations able to be put to the jury as to the risk of discovery and veracity, and perhaps barely as to alternative sources of knowledge of sexual activity. It was for the jury to take them into consideration, with the benefit of seeing and hearing the complainant (by closed circuit television) and the direct evidence of the complainant. The jury could place weight on the doctor’s evidence of the sexual assault history, of which no complaint was made in the appeal. For present purposes the letters and the Weerawardena evidence should be regarded as properly before the jury. On the whole of the evidence, there was an ample basis for the jury to come to satisfaction of guilt beyond reasonable doubt. 
     
      
       
      Ground 7: “Lack of Corroboration” 
       
      
    118 In part this went beyond unreasonable verdicts. The appellant submitted first, that the absence of corroboration of the complainant’s evidence was a factor in the unreasonableness of the verdict; but secondly, that in the absence of corroboration the judge should have directed the jury not only that it may be dangerous to convict but that it was dangerous to convict.  
     
      
    119 No application for such a direction was made by counsel for the appellant.  
     
      
    120 In the submissions about appropriate directions the Crown Prosecutor suggested to the judge that “although there is corroborative evidence … the Crown case is that the only witness that asserted the commission of the offence is the complainant and therefore a Murray type direction would be appropriate”. In R v Murray (1987) 11 NSWLR 12 this Court said that although it was not required that the jury be warned that it was unsafe to convict on the uncorroborated evidence of the person upon whom a prescribed sexual offence was alleged to have been committed - 
     
      
       
        
        “ … this does not mean that the judge cannot or should not, as is done in all cases of serious crime, stress upon the jury the necessity for the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the truthfulness of the witness who stands alone as proof of the Crown case. In all cases of serious crime it is customary for judges to stress that where there is only one witness asserting the commission of the crime, the evidence of that witness must be scrutinised with great care before a conclusion is arrived at that a verdict of guilty should be brought in; but a direction of that kind does not of itself imply that the witness' evidence is unreliable.” 
        
       
      
    121 In R v BWT (2002) 54 NSWLR 241 at [32] Wood CJ at CL, in identifying directions falling for consideration for the summing-up in a sexual assault case, referred to the Murray direction “to the effect that where there is only one witness asserting the commission of a crime, the evidence of that witness ‘must be scrutinised with great care’ before a conclusion is arrived at that a verdict of guilty should be brought in”. 
     
      
    122 Returning to the present case, after discussion of other directions to be given counsel for the appellant made his submissions, which included -  
     
      
       
        
        “HIS HONOUR: I’d be giving them the warning in any event that the case depends on their fundamental acceptance of her evidence beyond a reasonable doubt and therefore it ought to be scrutinised for that reason alone with great care. 
        
       
       
        
        HOENIG: That’s the Murray direction. I would ask that your Honour direct that if they find because her evidence in respect of the individual counts is, and the word these days is ‘unsupported’, then it may be dangerous to convict on her evidence alone and the reason why.” 
        
       
      
    123 The judge said that he would “ponder that and get back to you if I have any further difficulties about it”. In the result, the judge’s summing-up included - 
     
      
       
        
        “There are some other directions which I have to give you. In this case the Crown has indicated that it relies upon the evidence of the complainant in order to establish each case against the accused, that she was the only witness to what was occurring and in cases where the Crown relies upon one witness the Court is bound to inform the jury that the evidence of that witness must be scrutinised with great care. In other words, before that evidence can be accepted beyond a reasonable doubt bearing in mind that it is a single person who is giving the evidence in the absence of other confirmatory evidence suggesting that some other person witnessed or heard something, then that evidence requires the jury to approach its task with great care, in other words, prepared to accept the evidence of that one witness beyond a reasonable doubt so as to conclude that the offence has taken place.” 
        
       
      
    124 Thus the application for a direction was explicitly for a may be dangerous direction, not a was dangerous direction. In contrast, counsel for the appellant had asked for a must be dangerous direction in relation to delay in making complaint, then agreeing on a may be dangerous direction on that matter. The corroboration direction given was that the complainant’s evidence should be scrutinised with great care. 
     
      
    125 It was not necessary that the complainant’s evidence be corroborated (Evidence Act, s 164), and the judge was prohibited from giving a general warning to the jury of the danger of convicting on the uncorroborated evidence of any child witness (s 165A(2)). Whether the complainant’s evidence was properly to be regarded as uncorroborated need not be decided: it has been said that relationship evidence, at least of the guilty passion kind, can be corroborative (R v McKeon (1986) 31 A Crim R 357; R v L (CCA, 6 April 1992, unreported)), and if what I have said about the letters and the Weerawardena evidence as general admissions be correct it could readily be seen as corroborative evidence.  
     
      
    126 However that be, in my opinion the direction given was adequate to the situation that the complainant was the only witness to give evidence of the acts charged against the appellant. Certainly a was dangerous direction was not required; that must have been the assessment of counsel for the appellant, and in my opinion it was correct. In Robinson v R [2006] 162 A Crim R 88 Spigelman CJ said at [19] that the formulation “dangerous to convict” was best avoided save in exceptional circumstances, because it was a powerful direction capable of being understood and frequently understood as in effect a direction to acquit. That would apply with force to a direction that it was dangerous to convict. Such a direction in the present case would have been excessive.  
     
      
    127 Taking into account that the evidence of the complainant was uncorroborated, in the sense that she was the only person to give direct evidence of the conduct charged against the appellant, in my opinion it remained open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the appellant. This did not, alone or in combination with the matters earlier considered, make the verdicts unreasonable. 
     
      
       
      Ground 5: “Silence” 
       
       
      Ground 11A: Due to counsel’s advice in the trial to the appellant that he should not give evidence and the acceptance of that advice by the appellant, the appellant was denied the opportunity of explaining matters without which explanation cost him the chance of an acquittal and caused a miscarriage of justice. 
       
      
    128 In the appellant’s written submissions was submitted under ground 5 that “with all the above-stated grounds being in play” (now meaning grounds 1, 3 and 4) and the appellant not giving evidence or explaining any of the allegations, any chance of an acquittal was realistically denied to the appellant; and that there had thereby been a miscarriage of justice.  
     
      
    129 The relevant principles have recently been summarised by Hunt AJA, with the agreement of Simpson and Rothman JJ, in Seymour v R [2006] NSWCCA 206 - 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        [19] 
          
        It is now accepted that a trial may have been unfair, leading to a miscarriage of justice, by reason of the manner in which counsel appearing for the accused conducted his defence:  
        TKWJ v R  
        (2002) 212 CLR 124 at [25], [28], [31], [75], [97], [101], [103];  
        Ali v R 
         (2005) 214 ALR 1 at [9], [99];  
        Nudd v R  
        (2006) 225 ALR 161 at [2], [12]–[15], [24]–[25], [62], [81], [151]. These three cases may conveniently be referred to collectively as the recent High Court trilogy (as did Kirby J in  
        Nudd v R  
        at [40]). 
         
         
        [20] 
          
        It is, however, important to note that such a ground of appeal neither requires nor permits an inquiry into the competence of the counsel in question; what must be established is the objective fact that there was a miscarriage of justice as a result of counsel’s conduct, in the sense that there has been a loss of a chance of acquittal which was fairly open to the accused:  
        TKWJ v R  
        at [13], [16]–[17], [79], [83], [107];  
        Ali v R

        at [2], [8]–[12], [24]–[25], [62], [64]–[68], [81], [151], [157]. An appellant carries a heavy burden:  
        R v Miletic  
        [1977] 1 VR 593 at 597 (cited by McHugh J in

        [21] 
          
        Relevant to the existence of a miscarriage of justice in the particular trial are the issues of whether the conduct of counsel represented a legitimate choice a competent counsel could fairly make in the circumstances of that trial and whether, viewed objectively, it was a rational tactical decision in the particular forensic situation in which it was made. When that situation is examined, issues such as the forensic advantage which may have been sought and possible prejudice which may have been caused by counsel’s conduct are relevant but not necessarily decisive considerations:  
        TKWJ v R  
        at [16]–[17], [24]–[28], [31], [33], [81]–[85], [95], [97], [106]–[112];

        In  
        TKWJ v R  
        , Gleeson CJ said (at [16]): 
         
         
          
          It is undesirable to attempt to be categorical about what might make unfair an otherwise regularly conducted trial. But, in the context of the adversarial system of justice, unfairness does not exist simply because an apparently rational decision by trial counsel, as to what evidence to call or not to call, is regarded by an appellate court as having worked to the possible, or even probable, disadvantage of the accused. For a trial to be fair, it is not necessary that every tactical decision of counsel be carefully considered, or wise. And it is not the role of a Court of Criminal Appeal to investigate such decisions in order to decide whether they were made after the fullest possible examination of all material considerations. Many decisions as to the conduct of a trial are made almost instinctively, and on the basis of experience and impression rather than analysis of every possible alternative. That does not make them wrong or imprudent, or expose them to judicial scrutiny. Even if they are later regretted, that does not make the client a victim of unfairness. It is the responsibility of counsel to make tactical decisions, and assess risks. 
           
          
         
        In  
        Ali v R  
        , Hayne J (with whom Gummow J agreed) said (at [25]): 
         
         
          
          An appellate court does not and may not know what information trial counsel had when deciding whether or not to object to evidence. That is why, in  
          TKWJ 
          , I concluded that the question of miscarriage does not turn on a factual inquiry into why trial counsel acted or did not act in a particular way. That kind of inquiry cannot be made. Rather, the question is whether there  
          could 
           be a reasonable explanation for the course that was adopted at trial. If there could be such an explanation, it follows that the fundamental nature of a criminal trial as an adversarial and accusatorial process that no miscarriage of justice is shown to have occurred.

        In  
        Nudd v R  
        , Gummow & Hayne JJ adopted that statement of Hayne J in  
        TKWJ v R  
        , in saying (at [27]): 
         
         
          
          For the reasons given in  
          TKWJ 
          , the inquiry about miscarriage must be an objective inquiry, not an examination of what trial counsel for an accused did or did not know or think about. The critical question is what did or did not happen at trial, not why that came about. [Citation omitted]

         (1990) 19 NSWLR 677 at 685, Gleeson CJ summarised the principles relevant to a miscarriage of justice based on the conduct of counsel: 
         
        
       
      
    1. A Court of Criminal Appeal has a power and a duty to intervene in the case of a miscarriage of justice, but what amounts to a miscarriage of justice is something that has to be considered in the light of the way in which the system of criminal justice operates. 2. As a general rule an accused person is bound by the way the trial is conducted by counsel, regardless of whether that was in accordance with the wishes of the client, and it is not a ground for setting aside a conviction that decisions made by counsel were made without, or contrary to, instructions, or involve errors of judgment or even negligence. 3. However, there may arise cases where something has occurred in the running of a trial, perhaps as the result of ""flagrant incompetence"" of counsel, or perhaps from some other cause, which will be recognised as involving, or causing, a miscarriage of justice. It is impossible, and undesirable, to attempt to define such cases with precision. When they arise they will attract appellate intervention. 
     
      
       
        
         
        … 
         
         
        [26] 
          
        What must therefore be examined in this case is what counsel who appeared for the appellant at the trial did, and whether there could be a rational (or reasonable) basis for what he did.” 
        
       
      
    130 Flagrant incompetence as a qualitative investigation of counsel’s conduct is no longer a test, if it ever was. The test is the objective test described by Hunt AJA. Despite the objectivity of the inquiry emphasised in the High Court trilogy, there was evidence put before this Court which went in part to why counsel for the appellant advised the appellant not to give evidence and why the appellant did not give evidence. 
     
      
    131 Two affidavits of the appellant were read.  
     
      
    132 One affidavit purported to “outline the evidence I would have provided at my trial if I were given the opportunity to do so”. Much of the affidavit was not of that nature, but in the nature of commentary or submission on events at and evidence given at the trial; there was some evidence which the appellant might have wished to give at the trial. Only in a few limited areas did the affidavit touch upon whether counsel for the appellant was instructed as to the matters of which the appellant said he would have given evidence (as to one matter, it was said that counsel was not told of it).  
     
      
    133 In the other affidavit the appellant said that he believed that he made it clear to his lawyers that he wanted and intended to give evidence, but did not do so “at the insistence of” his counsel. He said that he told his counsel that he wanted to give evidence and had nothing to hide, and - 
     
      
       
        
        “18. Mr Hoenig responded to me by saying words to the following effect: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘No you talk too much, the Crown Prosecutor will be all over you!’ 
           
           
          ‘Take my advice, don’t give evidence!’ 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        19. I also remember having a discussion with Mr Hoenig after the case closed and before the Jury returned its verdict. During that discussion, Mr Hoenig said to me words to the following effect: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘I still think that I made the right decision with you not giving evidence’ 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        20. I remember being adamant about wanting to give evidence at the beginning and feel that Mr Hoenig wore me down after we had discussed the issue on a number of occasions.” 
        
       
      
    134 The Crown read an affidavit of Mr Ron Hoenig, the appellant’s counsel at the trial. It included - 
     
      
       
        
        “4. In relation to the appellant’s three page affidavit, I state that I gave the appellant very strong advice not to give evidence in this trial, but I left the decision to him. I told him that it was his trial and that I would do what he instructed me to do. He did want to give evidence, but he made the final decision not to do this just prior to the complainant being cross-examined, as this was when I needed to know what he would do. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        6. The decision that it was best not to call the appellant was a tactical one; it was not a decision based on any of the trial judge’s ruling in the trial as I recall. 
        
       
       
        
        7. It was my view that the appellant would have been a poor witness. I was concerned by his instructions that it was the complainant that initiated sexual contact, and his tendency to blame everyone else for his predicament. I was concerned about that coming out before the jury. 
        
       
       
        
        8. Whether or not the appellant gave evidence was always a matter of flexibility depending on how the trial proceeded. Nothing eventuated that caused me to change my mind. Looking at the trial with the benefit of hindsight, shortly after the verdict, I believed the tactical decision was correct. 
        
       
       
        
        9. My recollection of the trial is that the complainant was inconsistent about the counts and that my view was that if she were not corroborated the appellant would probably be acquitted. The appellant’s wife was helpful to his case; she gave evidence of the complainant seeing them engaged in a sexual act, and of the complainant watching a pornographic video; and a number of other matters which assisted the appellant’s case. The Minister of Religion also went poorly in cross-examination. There were also inconsistencies, which I felt helped our case. I asked the jury to concentrate on the counts on indictment and thought that they could have acquitted the appellant on some of the counts. 
        
       
       
        
        10. At the end of the day it was the appellant signed letters going into evidence coupled with the Minister’s evidence, which were the core problems and how the appellant could possibly explain them away without doing more damage to his case. If he’d given evidence it would have required cross-examination of the complainant on areas that I believed would work against the appellant’s chances of an acquittal. 
        
       
       
        
        11. The appellant’s instructions to me were always that he had not committed any of the offences contained in the indictment, and that the only sexual contact he’d had was one occasion when his penis had rubbed against the complainant’s vagina, which he said she had initiated. It was my view that if the jury were to hear that assertion, they would not accept this, and this was a further factor in my advice to him that he should not give evidence.” 
        
       
      
    135 Neither the appellant nor Mr Hoenig was cross-examined. 
     
      
    136 For two interlocked reasons, in my opinion there is no substance to these grounds of appeal. 
     
      
    137 First, even without regard to the affidavit evidence there was plainly a rational basis for Mr Hoenig advising the appellant not to give evidence, which advice the appellant accepted despite his initial wish to give evidence. The letters and the Weerawardena evidence called for explanation, and even if not dealt with in the appellant’s evidence in chief were an obvious focus of cross-examination. That the appellant was likely to suffer from poor or incredible explanation, or from cross-examination legitimately moving from the generality of admitted sexual activity, attraction and weakness to particular conduct as charged against him, was of itself apparent good reason to advise that he should not give evidence. Regard to the affidavits brings the same conclusion. The conduct the subject of the appellant’s instructions in para 11 of Mr Hoenig’s affidavit, could well have come out if he gave evidence, and would have been very detrimental to him. At risk to objectivity of the inquiry, Mr Hoenig’s assessment was in accordance with the rational basis earlier mentioned, and his advice was given with the accompanying view that there were matters as referred to in his para 9 which might cause the jury to acquit the appellant on some of the counts. It was not a situation that giving evidence was the appellant’s only hope. 
     
      
    138 Secondly, the affidavit concerning evidence the appellant might have wished to give at the trial, so far as it disclosed that evidence, did not have substantial content. The matters raised were often otherwise within the evidence, or could have been brought out without evidence from the appellant, or were to varying degrees peripheral. For example, there was much description of the tent and bathing arrangements and the proximity of the roller door of the shed, leading to the assertion that the conduct the subject of count 3 could not have occurred because the complainant’s mother “would have been with [the complainant’s brother], or at least right behind him to fetch more hot water from the kitchen area … “. The facts for this inconsistency of opportunity submission were already in the evidence, and counsel for the appellant made the point, see the passage from his address to the jury earlier set out. The affidavit did not provide any real explanation of the letters, saying that when they were written “I had no idea of what I had been accused of by [the complainant]” and that they all “concerned the one issue and that was that I had allowed [the complainant] to gyrate herself on me”; the attempt so to explain them would have been damaging, and was belied by the instructions in para 11 of Mr Hoenig’s affidavit. The first Weerawardena evidence was not denied; the second Weerawardena evidence was explained as denial of a question whether the appellant had penetrated the complainant. This had not been put to Mr Weerawardena, but if it had been part of the appellant’s instructions and had been said by him in evidence it is unlikely to have assisted the appellant in the jurys’ eyes. 
     
      
    139 There is no point in attempting to record in these reasons all that might be found in the affidavit; I have considered it all. In my opinion, that the appellant did not give evidence did not bring loss of a chance of acquittal which was fairly open to the appellant. 
     
      
       
      The application for leave to appeal against sentence 
       
      
    140 The appellant made no written submissions in support of grounds 12 and 13. In oral submissions the appellant accepted that the offences were serious and “[o]ne would say eight years I suppose is within range”, and nothing was put in support of ground 12. At to ground 13, it was orally submitted that there were special circumstances, but it was not made clear what they might have been; my best understanding is that it was contended that the sorrow in the letters warranted a lesser non-parole period. 
     
      
    141 No basis has been shown for displacing the sentences for a total period of 8 years, which in my opinion were well open to the judge. At the appellant’s sentencing his counsel submitted that the need for adjustment upon release into the community and for psychiatric assistance constituted special circumstances, but the judge expressly declined to find special circumstances. I am unable to see error in the judge’s assessment.  
     
      
       
       
      The result 
       
      
    142 The appeal against conviction should be dismissed. Notwithstanding the exiguous support for an appeal against sentence, the application for leave to appeal should be granted in order that it may be put to rest. The appeal against sentence should be dismissed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 HUNT AJA: I agree with Johnson J. 
     
      
    2 JOHNSON J: The Appellant, Thomas Andrew Keir, appeals against his conviction for the murder of his wife, Jean Angela Keir, at Tregear on or about 9 February 1988. Following a trial before MW Campbell AJ sitting without a jury, the Appellant was convicted on 22 October 2004. On 13 December 2004, the Appellant was sentenced to imprisonment for a term of 22 years commencing on 20 February 1998 and expiring on 19 February 2020, with a non-parole period of 16 years expiring on 19 February 2014. 
     
      
    3 The Appellant appeals against conviction only. No application for leave to appeal is made with respect to sentence. 
     
      
       
      The Appellant’s Trial 
       
      
    4 The trial before Campbell AJ was the second retrial of the Appellant. The Appellant’s conviction, following a trial before Adams J and a jury, was quashed by the Court of Criminal Appeal on 28 February 2002 (upon the ground that the Crown had fallen into the “prosecutor’s fallacy” concerning DNA evidence): R v Keir (2002) 127 A Crim R 198. The Appellant’s conviction, following a retrial before Kirby J and a jury, was quashed by the Court on 23 December 2003 (upon the ground that internet searches concerning the Appellant had been conducted by jury members during the course of the trial): R v K (2003) 59 NSWLR 431.  
     
      
    5 Thereafter, the Appellant elected to be tried by Judge alone pursuant to s.132 Criminal Procedure Act 1986 and the Director of Public Prosecutions consented to this course. The trial commenced before Campbell AJ on 27 July 2004 and proceeded until 2 September 2004.  
     
      
    6 A judge who tries criminal proceedings without a jury must give reasons, including the principles of law applied by the judge and the findings of fact on which the judge relied in returning a verdict: s.133(1)-(2) Criminal Procedure Act 1986. The judge is to take into account any warning which is required by law to be given to a jury in the circumstances of the case: s.133(3).  
     
      
    7 On 22 October 2004, Campbell AJ returned a verdict of guilty to the charge of murder, and published extensive reasons for that verdict occupying 173 pages and 1,112 paragraphs: R v Keir [2004] NSWSC 964. On 13 December 2004, Campbell AJ sentenced the Appellant for the offence: R v Keir [2004] NSWSC 1194. 
     
      
       
      Overview of Crown and Defence Cases at Trial 
       
      
    8 The Appellant and Jean Angela Keir (nee Strachan) were married on 11 August 1984, when the Appellant was 26 years old and Jean Keir was 18 years old. They had met through Jean Keir’s mother, Christine Strachan, who worked for an upholstery business of which the Appellant was a part owner. On 31 December 1984, a son, Michael, was born to the marriage. Following their marriage, the Appellant and Jean Keir lived at a home at 18 Wilkes Crescent, Tregear, a property purchased from Christine Strachan’s mother.  
     
      
    9 It was the Crown case that the Appellant and Jean Keir lived happily together for a period. However, Jean Keir became unhappy in the marriage and the Appellant was jealous and possessive of her. In late 1987, Jean Keir met Carl Neiding and had sexual intercourse with him on one occasion. She informed the Appellant of this fact. 
     
      
    10 On about 4 February 1988, Jean Keir went to Culburra, on the south coast, with her sister and her sister’s boyfriend. Although the Appellant had agreed to this, on 9 February 1988, he drove to Culburra to bring his wife home. He did not tell her that he was coming and, when he arrived there, he forced her into his car. When the Appellant stopped at a service station at Casula, Jean Keir left and hitchhiked to Mr Neiding’s flat at Bondi. After telephone communication between the Appellant and Mr Neiding, Mr Neiding drove Jean Keir to her home at 18 Wilkes Crescent, Tregear, and left her there with the Appellant, at 10.30 pm or later on 9 February 1988. On the Crown case, Mr Neiding was the last person, apart from the Appellant, to see Jean Keir alive.  
     
      
    11 It was the Crown case that, on that night or the next morning, the Appellant murdered his wife and disposed of her body, which has never been found. The Crown alleged that the Appellant had buried his wife’s body initially in the backyard of 18 Wilkes Crescent, Tregear and later had moved the body elsewhere. In so doing, the Crown alleged that the Appellant had left small bones from the body in the ground of the Tregear property. The Crown contended, on the basis of DNA evidence, considered together with other evidence in the case, that the bones were those of Jean Keir.  
     
      
    12 It was the Appellant’s case that Jean Keir was still alive. It was contended that she had had an affair with Mr Neiding, and had left the Appellant for Mr Neiding on 10 February 1988. The Appellant gave evidence at the trial. He said that he had not seen Jean Keir since that date, although he alleged that he had spoken to her on the telephone and that she had visited the house on two occasions in his absence, which he could tell from items which she had left behind.  
     
      
    13 A further issue in the trial giving rise to grounds of appeal, was the question whether Jean Keir had been seen by others, or had spoken to others, since 9 February 1988.  
     
      
    14 The Appellant contended at trial that the DNA evidence was unreliable, given the risk of contamination and what was said to be conflicting evidence of persons who had undertaken DNA analysis of the bones in Victoria, South Australia and the United States of America. 
     
      
       
      The Grounds of Appeal 
       
      
    15 The Appellant was unrepresented at the hearing of the appeal. He had been represented by counsel at trial. He relied upon written submissions which he had prepared in support of the grounds of appeal and made oral submissions to the Court at the hearing. 
     
      
    16 The grounds of appeal are in the following terms:

      : The verdict is unsafe and unsatisfactory for the following reasons: 
       
       
      (a) the trial Judge erroneously and wrongfully disregarded and rejected factual and crucial direct exculpatory evidence (being the person of interest form dated 30 October 1988 held by the police which stated  
      “person located” 
      ); 
       
       
      (b) the trial Judge erroneously and wrongfully disregarded and rejected exculpatory evidence concerning the sightings of Jean Keir (identification evidence of alleged victim after 9 February 1988); 
       
       
      (c) the trial Judge erroneously and wrongfully disregarded and rejected crucial DNA evidence (being the test results from Victoria, and South Australia, the second test results from Victoria and a second DNA profile located in the tests in America); 
       
       
      (d) the trial Judge erroneously and wrongfully disregarded and rejected the contamination factor concerning DNA testing and results; 
       
       
      (e) the trial Judge erroneously and wrongfully disregarded and rejected photographic evidence concerning the excavations of where and when the alleged bones were allegedly located, plus the photographic evidence concerning the concrete slab under the oil heater tank prior to the first excavations in April 1991; 
       
        
       
      Ground 2 
      : The trial Judge erroneously and wrongfully transposed the consistency of the DNA evidence (America) with the statistical probability of 400,000:1, into identity of the alleged victim ( 
      “prosecutor's fallacy” 
      ). 
       
       
      Ground 3 
      : The trial Judge significantly erred in his conclusion that: 
       
       
      (a) Jean Keir is dead; and 
       
       
      (b) her death was caused by an act of the Appellant. 
       
       
      Ground 4 
      : The trial Judge erroneously and wrongfully allowed suspicion, grave suspicion and speculation to cloud his judgment in his fact finding mission throughout the trial and in his judgment, which dramatically affected his formulation in reasoning to his conclusion, resulting in a miscarriage of justice. 
       
       
      Ground 5 
      : The trial Judge significantly erred in departing from the firm ground of  
      “proof beyond reasonable doubt” 
      , which dramatically affected his formulation in reasoning to his conclusions, and resulted in a miscarriage of justice, in the following respects: 
       
       
      (a) the trial Judge erroneously and wrongfully chose to believe blatant lies and recent invention over proven facts concerning the document referred to in Ground 1(a) above; 
       
       
      (b) the trial Judge was too ready to reject any innocent inferences and exculpatory evidence, such as the sightings and the official police document referred to in Ground 1(a) above; 
       
       
      (c) the trial Judge did not give adequate or appropriate consideration concerning the totality of the DNA tests and results or the statistical probabilities; 
       
       
      (d) the trial Judge did not give adequate or appropriate consideration concerning the contamination of the DNA. 
       
      
    17 The grounds of appeal overlap in a number of respects. In the main, the Appellant challenges findings of fact made by the learned trial Judge in a number of critical areas. 
     
      
       
      Conviction Appeal from Verdict of Judge Sitting Without a Jury 
       
      
    18 In R v Moffatt (2000) 112 A Crim R 201 at 202 [3]-[5], Wood CJ at CL (Foster AJA and Adams J agreeing) described the function of the Court of Criminal Appeal, in an appeal against conviction from a trial on indictment by judge alone, in the following way: 
     
      
       
        
        “The Court of Criminal Appeal is a court of error, and does not proceed by way of rehearing in a way that permits it to substitute its own findings of fact for those of the jury, or of the trial Judge where acting alone:  
        Kyriakou 
         (1987) 29 A Crim R50, and  
        Kurtic 
         CCA (NSW) 26 February 1996 unreported. 
         
         
        Where, as in the present case, the relevant ground is that the verdict, or more accurately the finding on the question of guilt by the trial Judge (s17 Criminal Procedure Act 1986) should be set aside upon the ground that it is unreasonable, or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence (s6(1) Criminal Appeal Act 1912), then it can only intervene if, after making its own independent assessment of the evidence, it concludes that it was not open for the trial judge to have been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the appellant:  
        M 
         (1994) 181 CLR 487 at 493, and  
        Jones 
         (1997) 149 ALR 598. In that event error permitting the substitution of a verdict of acquittal is established:  
        Coombe 
         CCA (NSW) 24 April 1997 at p11 and p12. 
         
         
        What is required in this respect is attention to the matters identified in  
        Fleming 
         (1998) 158 ALR 379,  
        Giam 
         (1999) 104 A Crim R416, and  
        Gipp 
         (1998) 194 CLR 106.” 
        
       
      
    19 Wood CJ at CL referred in the lastmentioned passage, to the decision of the High Court in Fleming v The Queen [1998] 197 CLR 250 where it was observed, at 256 [12], in the context of an appeal from a trial on indictment by judge alone, that use of the potentially confusing phrase “unsafe and unsatisfactory” to cover the several different elements in s.6(1) Criminal Appeal Act 1912 is “liable to mislead” and that there is no substitute for giving attention to the precise terms in which s.6(1) is expressed. With respect to the interaction of s.6(1) Criminal Appeal Act 1912 and s.133 Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (then s.33 of that Act), the Court said in a unanimous judgment at 262 [26]: 
     
      
       
        
        “Thirdly, the first limb of s 6(1), which deals with the unsatisfactory quality of ‘the verdict of the jury’, must now be seen through the prism of s 33(1). The first limb will address attention to the evidence upon which the trial judge acted, or upon which it was open to the trial judge to act, in reaching the finding as to ultimate guilt. Approached on that footing, is that finding ‘unreasonable’ or one which ‘cannot be supported’?” 
        
       
      
    20 The Appellant advances an unsafe and unsatisfactory ground on the present appeal. That ground ought be approached in the manner indicated in Fleming v The Queen and R v Moffatt. The question is whether the verdict is unreasonable or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence. The Court must make its own independent assessment of the evidence. In undertaking this task, the credibility findings of the trial Judge with respect to the witnesses remain significant: Fleming v The Queen at 266-267 [44]-[46].  
     
      
       
      Ground 1(a) - Verdict Unsafe and Unsatisfactory by Reason of the Manner in Which the Trial Judge Dealt with the Person Located Report  
       
      
    21 This ground of appeal relates to a document tendered in the trial entitled “Person of Interest Report for ‘Located Person’ dated 30/10/88” (Exhibit M2). This document formed an important part of the Appellant’s case that Jean Keir was, in fact, still alive.  
     
      
    22 The document was created by Inspector Phillip Higgins at the Mt Druitt Police Station on 30 October 1988, some eight months after the disappearance of Jean Keir on 9 February 1988. The body of the form contained the following entry: 
     
      
       
        
        “Approximately 1 month ago,  
        [Jean]  
        KEIR was seen by a friend of the family in the shopping centre at Emerton in Mount Druitt. When the friend attempted to approach KEIR and speak to her, KEIR turned and ran away. It now [sic] the opinion of KEIR’s family that KEIR does not want to get in contact with any members of her family. The reason for this is unknown to the family. After speaking with KEIR’s brother, Leonard STRACHAN and her sister, Heather STRACHAN they no longer fear for her safety and welfare as they did in there  
        [sic]  
        original missing person report which they made in May this year. They are still worried about her, but agree that it is no longer a police matter.” 
        
       
      
    23 The Person Located Report was the second “person of interest” report filed at Mt Druitt Police Station in relation to the disappearance of Jean Keir. The first report (Exhibit M1) was created by Inspector Higgins on 1 May 1988, following a visit to the station made by Clifford Strachan and Heather Strachan to report that Jean Keir was missing (Trial Judgment [893]). 
     
      
    24 Although Inspector Higgins agreed that he had filled out the Person Located Report, he had no independent recollection of doing so. He made a statement dated 25 September 1991 which referred to the event. He assumed that Leonard Strachan was present and he spoke to him, although no check was made on the identity of persons making such reports, nor are they required to sign forms or entries in official notebooks ([897]-[898]). Campbell AJ noted at [899] - [900] that the alleged sighting of Jean Keir was that of Jennifer Amos (previously Soler) to which further reference will be made shortly (concerning Ground 1(b)). As will be seen, Campbell AJ at [890] concluded with respect to the evidence of Mrs Amos, that her alleged sighting did not give rise to a reasonable possibility that Jean Keir was alive after 10 February 1988.  
     
      
    25 Campbell AJ turned to that part of the Person Located Report which asserted that members of the Strachan family “no longer fear for [Jean Keir’s] safety and welfare”. Clifford and Heather Strachan were called as Crown witnesses at trial. Both agreed that they had attended the police station in May 1988 to report that Jean Keir was missing. They denied, however, that they had attended the Mt Druitt Police Station in October 1988, let alone that they took part in an interview or “withdrew” their concern about the whereabouts of Jean Keir ([901]).  
     
      
    26 Jean Keir’s brother, Leonard Strachan, was called as a witness in the Crown case. Leonard Strachan would have been 14 years old in October 1988. He denied that he had attended the police station at all, let alone for the purpose of informing police that there was no longer a concern for the whereabouts and welfare of his sister. 
     
      
    27 In his written submissions, the Appellant repeats the submission advanced on his behalf by counsel at the trial before Campbell AJ. He contends that the Person Located Report should have been treated by Campbell AJ as a reliable document which recorded accurately the words and actions of Clifford, Heather and Leonard Strachan on 30 October 1988. The Appellant submits that each of these persons gave perjured evidence at the trial, denying that they had visited the police station and had made the report on 30 October 1988. The Appellant submits that Campbell AJ “erroneously and wrongfully disregarded and rejected the official police document” and “wrongfully accepted perjury over a proven fact”. The Appellant submits that, if his Honour had accepted the Person Located Report, he would have been bound to acquit the Appellant. 
     
      
    28 The Crown submits that Campbell AJ approached this issue carefully, having regard to the defence submission that the Strachans were lying, leading his Honour to “scrutinise their evidence with great care” ([908]). His Honour considered Leonard Strachan to be a “straightforward witness” and that it “is not easy to see why he would lie now” on this topic ([906]). Campbell AJ observed that it was not easy to see why Heather Strachan would deny going to the police station if she had in fact done so ([907]).  
     
      
    29 The Crown submits that it was open to the trial Judge to make the findings which he did about the Person Located Report, taking into account the evidence given by Inspector Higgins and by Clifford, Leonard and Heather Strachan. Campbell AJ rejected submissions at trial that the Strachans had committed perjury at the trial. The Crown submits that no error is disclosed in his Honour’s decision to accept the evidence of the Strachans at trial, which had been evaluated carefully, that they had not attended the Mt Druitt Police Station in October 1988 and had not withdrawn the person of interest report initially made in May 1988.  
     
      
    30 In approaching this ground (and other grounds) of appeal, it is important to bear in mind that Campbell AJ, as trial Judge, observed the witnesses giving evidence. His Honour had the advantage of hearing the evidence given and assessing the demeanour of witnesses in the trial. His Honour has given careful reasons in his detailed judgment for accepting the sworn evidence of the Strachans at trial. 
     
      
    31 The conclusions of Campbell AJ concerning the Person Located Report involved two steps: 
     
      
       
      (a) as to the alleged sighting by Mrs Amos referred to in the document, a finding that the Crown had negatived any reasonable possibility arising from it that Jean Keir was alive after 10 February 1988; 
       
       
      (b) as to the suggested withdrawal by members of the Strachan family of their concern about the safety and welfare of Jean Keir, a finding that Leonard, Clifford and Heather Strachan did not make such a report to police on 30 October 1988.  
       
      
    32 In light of these conclusions, the Person Located Report provided no evidentiary assistance to the Appellant at trial. 
     
      
    33 I have considered the evidence of Clifford Strachan, Heather Strachan and Leonard Strachan given at trial, together with that of Inspector Higgins. The trial Judge was conscious of the significance of this question to the trial and assessed carefully the evidence adduced. I detect no error in his Honour’s approach in reaching a conclusion which was clearly open on the evidence. His Honour’s findings were reasonable and supported by the evidence. 
     
      
    34 I reject Ground 1(a). 
     
      
       
      Ground 1(b): Verdict Unsafe and Unsatisfactory by Reason of the Trial Judge’s Findings About Alleged Sightings of Jean Keir 
       
      
    35 As noted earlier, the defence case at trial was that Jean Keir was still alive. The Appellant relied at trial upon three classes of evidence on this issue: 
     
      
       
      (a) evidence of independent witnesses concerning alleged sightings of Jean Keir after 9 February 1988 - Charlotte Chessnut, Michael Keir (the son of Jean Keir and the Appellant) and Jennifer Amos (previously Soler); 
       
       
      (b) evidence of the Appellant - the Appellant alleged that Jean Keir had rung him a few times and had visited the home in Wilkes Crescent, Tregear after 9 February 1988, although he did not see her on any of the alleged occasions; the Appellant also asserted that he had spoken to a number of people after 9 February 1988 who had seen Jean Keir in the company of Mr Neiding; 
       
       
      (c) the Person Located Report - the document considered with respect to Ground 1(a). 
       
      
    36 After a detailed analysis of the sightings’ evidence ([809]-[931]), Campbell AJ concluded at [932]: 
     
      
       
        
        “Considering the evidence as to ‘sightings’ and analogous matters both individually and together, against the background of the other evidence in the case, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the Crown has negatived any reasonable possibility that Jean Keir was alive after 10 February 1988 arising from the material dealt with under this heading.” 
        
       
      
    37 In his written submissions in support of this ground, the Appellant took, as a starting point, the observations of the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Keir (2002) 127 A Crim R 198 at 207 [37] where, in declining to apply the proviso, Giles JA (Greg James and McClellan JJ agreeing) touched upon the sighting evidence: 
     
      
       
        
        “The Crown case was strong. But it can not be taken in isolation from the identification evidence, and although reasons for doubting its reliability or credibility could properly be put forward that evidence can not be swept aside. The jury had to evaluate the evidence, and it would have been sufficient for the appellant that the identification evidence brought reasonable doubt. Miss Soler, in particular, was independent from the appellant and said that the person she thought was Mrs Keir had curly hair, which Mrs Keir had not had when previously known to her: other evidence showed that Mrs Keir had changed her hair style and had curly hair in early 1988. I do not think it can be said that, had the jury not been left with an erroneous appreciation of the significance of the DNA statistical evidence, the appellant would inevitably have been convicted.” 
        
       
      
    38 The Appellant notes that these observations were made by the Court before the evidence of Ms Chessnut and the Person Located Report became available. Accordingly, the Appellant submits that there was a stronger body of evidence of sightings before Campbell AJ than that which had been adduced at the first trial in 1999 and was before the Court of Criminal Appeal in 2002. The Appellant submits that the totality of the evidence of sightings represented substantial exculpatory evidence which gave rise to a clear reasonable doubt. He submits that this evidence “cannot be disregarded, rejected or swept aside” and that Campbell AJ erroneously and wrongfully disregarded and rejected the evidence of sightings of Jean Keir after 9 February 1988. 
     
      
    39 The Crown submits that the trial Judge’s conclusion, that the Crown had negatived any reasonable possibility that Jean Keir was alive after 9 February 1988, had been reached after careful consideration of the evidence. The Crown submits that the observations of the Court of Criminal Appeal in 2002 have no application to this appeal which follows a new, and second, retrial. Any comments made by the Court in 2002 are confined to the evidence given at the first trial and have no bearing on this Court’s analysis of the findings of Campbell AJ with respect to the evidence adduced in the present trial.  
     
      
    40 In approaching this ground of appeal, it is appropriate to observe that the Appellant does not contend that error is demonstrated in any specific part of the detailed analysis of Campbell AJ with respect to the sightings’ evidence. Rather, the Appellant contends that the sightings’ evidence was such that the Crown could not exclude the reasonable possibility that Jean Keir was alive after 10 February 1988 and, accordingly, there was a reasonable doubt concerning the guilt of the Appellant.  
     
      
    41 Like Campbell AJ, I will consider this ground of appeal by reference to the individual categories of evidence, then by assessment of the cumulative effect of the different categories. 
     
      
       
      The Independent Witnesses 
       
      
    42 Charlotte Chessnut gave evidence that she was shopping with her son, Chadwick, at the Emerton Shopping Centre, some months after February 1988. Chadwick Chessnut was five or six years old at the time and, before her disappearance, Jean Keir had regularly babysat him. Charlotte Chessnut gave evidence at the trial that Chadwick told her “that he thought he saw Jeanie” (T832.40). The Crown asked Ms Chessnut (T832.43): 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. What did he say? 
        
       
       
        
        A. He said, ‘Oh, mum. I think I saw Jeanie.’ That’s what he used to call her and so what I did I followed the lady, or I chased after her and I eventually saw where she was. I was following her and she turned around and it wasn’t Jeanie.” 
        
       
      
    43 With respect to this evidence, Campbell AJ said at [837]-[838]: 
     
      
       
        
        “Mrs Chessnut was cross-examined as to having told a private investigator in June 2002 that after hearing her son yell out ‘Jeanie’ she ‘looked up and there was no-one there’.  
         
         
        I do not consider it necessary to pursue this issue because at best the matter depends upon the impression of a five or six year old child. One would think that the natural reaction would have been to attempt to identify the person and clearly enough Jean Keir was not in fact identified.” 
        
       
      
    44 I detect no error in his Honour’s approach to this evidence and the conclusion reached with respect to it, which was clearly open. 
     
      
    45 Michael Keir was a little over three years old when his mother disappeared. He gave evidence at the trial of having seen her on two occasions since 9 February 1988. The first occasion was at the Mt Druitt swimming pool when he was about seven years old. He said that he was there with his cousin, Jenny Page. He told her that he had seen his mother, but she did not believe him. In cross-examination, Michael Keir agreed that his uncle, Leonard Strachan, could also have been at the pool (T1680-1681). The second alleged sighting by Michael Keir was in August 1998 when he said that she was sitting in a parked car across the street from the home of his grandmother, Joan Keir, where he was staying at the time. Michael Keir gave evidence that his grandmother had agreed with him when he pointed out his mother to her (T1682-1683). Michael Keir was cross-examined as to his recollection of both sightings.  
     
      
    46 In relation to the first alleged sighting by Michael Keir, Christine Strachan gave evidence that Michael had told her when he arrived home from the pool that he had seen Jean Keir, but that he had not said anything to Jennifer Amos or Leonard Strachan about it. Leonard Strachan gave evidence at the trial that he recalled the occasion, and he did not see anyone who looked like Jean Keir or who was Jean Keir (T861). In relation to the second occasion, Michael Keir’s evidence was supported by a statement that Joan Keir had given at the previous trial. She had died before the third trial, as had the Appellant’s father, Andrew Keir. As Campbell AJ noted at [835], the defence did not press in address the claimed sightings by Joan Keir or Andrew Keir. Nevertheless, his Honour stated at [835] that he had considered the transcript of their evidence carefully, but did not consider, when taken with the other evidence in the case, that it raised any reasonable possibility that Jean Keir was alive after 10 February 1988. 
     
      
    47 Having considered evidence touching upon the sightings by Michael Keir, Campbell AJ concluded at [850]-[851]: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is, I think, relevant that it was Michael, who had last seen his mother when he was three years old, apart from the suggested swimming pool occasion, who first identified the woman in the car. Joan Keir had the suggestion put to her by a witness whose own basis of identification must be very doubtful. Of course in her situation as the accused’s mother to see Jean Keir would be a wish fulfilled.  
         
         
        Having regard to the evidence as a whole I do not consider these two ‘sightings’ to raise a reasonable possibility that Jean Keir was alive after 19 February 1988.” 
        
       
      
    48 I do not detect any error in his Honour’s approach to the alleged sightings by Michael Keir. It was open to his Honour to reach the conclusion which he did with respect to this evidence.  
     
      
    49 As Campbell AJ observed at [852], trial counsel for the Appellant pressed vigorously the suggested sighting by Jennifer Amos as raising a reasonable possibility that Jean Keir was then still alive, and that the Crown had not negatived that possibility. It was the alleged sighting by Mrs Amos which was the subject of the Person Located Report considered above (concerning Ground 1(a)). 
     
      
    50 His Honour undertook a close examination of the evidence of Mrs Amos (at [853]ff). Mrs Amos had gone to school with Jean Keir, but had rarely seen her after leaving school. In about October 1988, Mrs Amos was working at a fruit shop in Emerton as a cashier. While working one day, at a time when the other two cashiers were on a break and when she was very busy, Mrs Amos said in evidence that she thought she saw someone resembling Jean Keir at the ATM next door to the fruit shop, about 30 feet from the place where she was standing. In examination in chief, Mrs Amos was asked by the Crown (T761.17): 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Can you tell us what you saw or noticed in terms of this person? 
         
        A. I thought I saw someone that resembled Jean at the ATM but it was just a quick glance as I was serving customers at the time, and the sun was coming down from the dome on to the floor and just made it too glary to really recognise anyone. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. At the time that you had this glance to the ATM, were you in the process of serving a customer or were you between two customers, do you recall? 
         
        A. Between the two customers.” 
        
       
      
    51 In the course of his analysis of the evidence of Mrs Amos, Campbell AJ said at [861]-[863]: 
     
      
       
        
        “She said that it was a good five or six years before that that she had last seen Jean Keir and that her hair had always been straight. She was obviously confused as to the period of time.  
         
         
        Mrs Amos said in chief that she was both long and short sighted and that she did not have her glasses on on that day. She also mentioned glare with the sun coming through some windows ‘on the ceiling’ and bouncing of polished tile.  
         
         
        She said that she was not ‘real confident’ that the person she saw was Jean Strachan and that it was possible that it may have been ‘a mistaken identity’.” 
        
       
      
    52 His Honour recounted the evidence of Mrs Amos in chief and under cross-examination concerning statements made by her on earlier occasions to police, to other persons and at the earlier trials. It is apparent that Mrs Amos had asserted that she had seen Jean Keir with greater certainty in her earlier accounts. Campbell AJ observed at [881]: 
     
      
       
        
        “Having seen and heard her give evidence I formed the clear impression that her retreat, I agree it was one, was based on a developing recognition of how hard it is, in terms of human experience, to be sure of an identification in such circumstances.” 
        
       
      
    53 Campbell AJ expressed his conclusions with respect to the sightings’ evidence of Mrs Amos in the following way at [884]-[890]: 
     
      
       
        
        “Certainty or otherwise by Mrs Amos is, in any event, far from the end of the matter.  
         
         
         The circumstances for observation were far from ideal and Mrs Amos had her work to attend to. The period involved was brief.  
         
         
         The figure she saw was a bit on the plump side. Jean Keir was thin. The suggestion was that she might have put on weight, that she was pregnant or was ‘just wearing a track suit’.  
         
         
         The figure she saw had curly hair. Mrs Amos said that she had always known Jean Keir with straight hair. This raises a question as to Mrs Amos’ powers of observation as, according to the accused, Exhibit 2 was taken when Michael was one year old, that is, before the occasion referred to in [854]. There is obviously room for error in age estimates. In the circumstances the fact that the sighted woman had curly hair is of little value unless she was otherwise identified as Jean Keir.  
        
       
       
        
         Mrs Amos did say that she saw the woman’s features and that appears to be the only aspect upon which the identification could be made other, perhaps, than an unexpressed impression as to movement, although there could not have been much of that.  
        
       
       
        
         Mrs Amos did not remember telling someone of her sighting. Memory for facts may well be different to memory for events. Nonetheless, having seen and heard Mrs Amos I would be very doubtful about the identification of Jean Keir even if Mrs Amos had adhered to the certainty expressed in her statement.  
         
         
        As it is, particularly when all the evidence in the case is taken into account, I do not consider that Mrs Amos’ ‘sighting’ raises a reasonable possibility that Jean Keir was alive after 10 February 1988.” 
        
       
      
    54 Once again, I detect no error in the approach of the trial Judge to the determination of the reliability and weight to be attached to the evidence of Mrs Amos. It is clear, from his Honour’s reasons, that his observations of Mrs Amos as a witness played a part in the assessment of her evidence. Having examined the evidence, I consider that his Honour’s conclusion was clearly open. The finding was reasonable and was supported by the evidence. 
     
      
       
      Evidence of the Appellant 
       
      
    55 In his evidence at trial, the Appellant stated that he had spoken with a number of people who had told him that they had seen Jean Keir, either in the company of Mr Neiding or on her own.  
     
      
    56 The Appellant alleged that he had met a man in Crows Nest who knew Mr Neiding and who had informed him that he had seen Mr Neiding at The Rocks in mid-1988, with a girlfriend whose description matched that of Jean Keir. The Crown called the man, Peter Henry Heibloem, who conducted personal development seminars over two weekends a year at a Crows Nest venue where the Appellant allegedly spoke with him. Mr Heibloem gave evidence that he did not know Mr Neiding, the Appellant or Jean Keir and had not been to The Rocks since he moved from Sydney in 1974 ([815]-[816]).  
     
      
    57 The Appellant alleged that, some time between May and July 1988, he had telephoned Karl Heinz Neiding, the father of Carl Neiding, who told him that he had seen his son recently with a new girlfriend, who matched the description of Jean Keir. Karl Heinz Neiding gave evidence at the first trial. The transcript of his evidence was tendered at the second trial and again at the present trial. He stated that he had been shown photographs of Jean Keir and had never seen the woman in the photographs with his son. He recalled receiving a telephone call from a man asking as to his son’s whereabouts, but could not tell him anything at the time. Whilst Karl Heinz Neiding recalled his son, Carl, coming to visit once with a girl from Adelaide, he recalled no women coming from Sydney.  
     
      
    58 Campbell AJ was satisfied that the Crown had negatived any reasonable possibility of Jean Keir being alive on the basis of this evidence ([821]-[828]). 
     
      
    59 The Appellant alleged that his aunt, Marlene Joan Wright, had told him that she had seen Jean Keir. Ms Wright said in evidence that she had never told the Appellant, or any other person, that she had seen or heard from Jean Keir ([831]). She agreed that her sister and the Appellant’s mother, Joan Keir, had told her she had seen Jean Keir in 1988 sitting in a red motor vehicle opposite her house ([832]). 
     
      
    60 The Appellant gave evidence that he received a telephone call from Jean Keir two-to-three weeks after she walked out in February 1988 ([516]). The Appellant said that Jean Keir paid a visit to the Wilkes Crescent, Tregear residence in May 1988 and telephoned him as well ([518]). The Appellant was cross-examined about the phone calls and the alleged visits (T1604-1620). Following a summary of the evidence of the Appellant concerning these telephone calls and visits, Campbell AJ concluded at [522]: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is convenient to say that, quite apart from other matters, the account of these conversations does not ring true to me. Why would Jean Keir ring the man from whom she had run away rather than her family and friends, even if not her mother? Why did she not at least wish to speak to Michael? The comment ‘she had split with Carl’ implies that she had continued a relationship with Carl Neiding. I do not believe this to be the fact. Most of the conversations appear to have been cut short by Jean Keir yet she was supposed to have initiated them. It is difficult to think of a rational explanation for Jean Keir being prepared to inform the accused that she had had a child, not his, but not inform her family and friends.” 
        
       
      
    61 The trial Judge had the opportunity to see various witnesses, including the Appellant, give evidence at the trial and to form a view concerning credibility and reliability. No error is demonstrated in his Honour’s reasoning and findings, which were clearly open on the evidence. 
     
      
       
      The Person Located Report 
       
      
    62 The evidence concerning the Person Located Report, and the findings of the trial Judge with respect to it, have been referred to earlier in this judgment (at paragraphs 21 to 34). As noted earlier, I detect no error in the findings of Campbell AJ with respect to this document. 
     
      
       
      Cumulative Effect of Evidence of Alleged Sightings 
       
      
    63 The Appellant submits, in effect, that the cumulative effect of the evidence of alleged sightings was such that a verdict of guilty was unreasonable and cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence. The Crown submits that it was open to the trial Judge to reach the conclusions which he did with respect to the various categories of evidence concerning alleged sightings and that this ground of appeal has not been made out. 
     
      
    64 I have given careful consideration to the evidence in the three categories set out above, together with the trial Judge’s findings and conclusions with respect to them. No error is revealed in his Honour’s approach to the determination of these issues. Campbell AJ had the advantage of seeing the various witnesses give evidence, and to make assessments concerning their credibility and reliability. His Honour gave thorough consideration to all aspects of the evidence which were capable of being taken into account as evidence of alleged sightings of Jean Keir, however tenuous or slight the particular items of evidence may have been. 
     
      
    65 Having assessed the material for the purpose of this appeal, it is clear that the individual findings with respect to the categories of evidence were open to the trial Judge. I have considered the various categories of evidence cumulatively for the purpose of determining whether the trial Judge’s findings were, in the sense referred to earlier, unreasonable. In my opinion, the cumulative effect of these matters does not have any greater strength than the sum of its individual parts. The findings by the learned trial Judge were reasonable and were supported by the evidence.  
     
      
    66 Ground 1(b) is rejected. 
     
      
       
      Ground 1(c) and (d) - Verdict Unsafe and Unsatisfactory by Reason of the Trial Judge’s Acceptance of Particular DNA Evidence at the Expense of Other DNA Evidence  
       
      
    67 It is appropriate to consider Ground 1(c) and (d) together.  
     
      
    68 DNA evidence constituted a critical part of the prosecution case against the Appellant. Campbell AJ undertook a detailed examination of evidence concerning DNA extraction and analysis before moving to findings concerning this issue ([695]-[779]).  
     
      
    69 The Appellant submits that Campbell AJ erroneously and wrongfully disregarded and rejected evidence in relation to the DNA of bones that was given by analysts from both Melbourne and Adelaide, to whom the bones were sent, together with blood samples taken from Jean Keir’s parents, Christine Strachan and Gaspar Baan. The Appellant submits further that, in accepting the results of DNA tests which were conducted in the United States of America, the trial Judge erroneously and wrongfully disregarded and rejected the contamination factor concerning that testing and the results obtained.  
     
      
    70 The Appellant submits that evidence of Dr Alan Atchinson, Manager of the Molecular Biology Unit within the Victorian Institute of Forensic Medicine and Dr Angela Van Daal, then a Senior Forensic Scientist at the State Forensic Science Service of South Australia, was such that the trial Judge ought to have concluded that the DNA evidence was extremely degraded and not reliable, and that results of the tests were not of sufficient clarity to permit definite conclusions of identity. The Appellant submits that a test undertaken in the United States of America was rejected on the basis of contamination, but that Campbell AJ had erred with respect to this evidence. The Appellant submits that the totality of the DNA evidence, including the Victorian and South Australian results, cast “more than a substantial doubt over the credibility and reliability of the DNA tests and results from America”. 
     
      
    71 The Appellant submits that the contamination factor raised “more than substantial doubt over the profiles located in the DNA testing in America” (Ground 1(d)). Having advanced a number of factual submissions, the Appellant contended that “contamination quite easily could have occurred and the contamination factor cannot be ruled out or swept aside”. He submitted that Campbell AJ had erred in his conclusions with respect to the DNA evidence in this respect. 
     
      
    72 The Crown acknowledges the significance of the DNA evidence to the verdict and submits that no error had been demonstrated so as to attract the intervention of this Court.  
     
      
    73 To place these grounds in context, it is helpful to refer to the scientific and forensic evidence concerning the seven bones located in the ground at 18 Wilkes Crescent, Tregear. 
     
      
    74 It was the Crown case that seven bones were located by the police in May 1991 during the excavation of the western side of the property at 18 Wilkes Crescent, Tregear.  
     
      
    75 Campbell AJ observed at [574]: 
     
      
       
        
        “I have not here traced each bone from Tregear to the doctor, however, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the seven numbered bones were found by police at 18 Wilkes Cres in May 1991. It has not been argued otherwise.” 
        
       
      
    76 On 3 May 1991, Dr Thomas Oettle, forensic pathologist, received from police a plastic bag containing fragments of bony material. Dr Oettle considered that one of the fragments was a proximal phalanx of probably the third finger of an adult human hand. He gave evidence that the phalanx appeared to be consistent with that of a person who had died three years earlier. On 17 May 1991, he handed the specimen to Dr Peter Ellis ([580]). 
     
      
    77 Dr Peter Ellis is a forensic pathologist at the Institute of Clinical Pathology and Medical Research at Westmead Hospital. Dr Ellis identified seven bones as being of human origin. Bone No. 1 (which he received from Dr Oettle) was a finger bone from the right hand. Bone No. 2 was the base of the right toe. Bone No. 3 was probably the base of the right thumb. Bone No. 4 was the left kneecap. Bone No. 5 was a bone from the left wrist. Bone No. 6 was a hand bone from the base of the middle finger of the left hand. Bone No. 7 was the base of one of the fingers of the right hand, one of the index, middle ring or little finger ([573]). 
     
      
    78 Dr Denise Donlon is a lecturer in the Department of Anatomy and Histology at the University of Sydney and, in 1997, a Consultant Anthropologist to the NSW Institute of Forensic Medicine. Her PhD in Physical Anthropology involved a study of the variations of the human skeleton. Dr Donlon examined Bone Nos. 1 to 6 on 17 June 1997. She considered that they belonged to one individual aged probably more than 16 years. Campbell AJ said at [584]-[588]: 
     
      
       
        
        “Dr Donlon indicated that attempting to calculate height from metacarpal length was not as ideal as the long bones, however, there was a formula which had application only to Caucasoids and was different for males and females. 
         
         
        She had done calculations on bone number 6 and concluded that on the assumption that the bones were those of a female that the stature, using that particular formula would be in the range 155.6 to 168.8 centimetres. If it were a male the range would be 161.8 to 173.5 centimetres. The top of the range for a female is five foot seven and a half inches. 
         
         
        Christine Strachan said that Jean Keir’s height was five foot six inches to five foot seven inches. Fiona Chalmers estimated Jean Keir’s height as ‘five foot six inches or five foot five inches’. The Person of Interest Report completed by Constable Higgins, when Heather Strachan reported Jean Keir records a height no doubt supplied by Heather or perhaps Clifford Strachan, of 165 cms. These figures all fall within the range. 
         
         
        The accused said that Jean Keir was taller than those figures. He said that he had always thought of himself as six foot two inches and he thought Jean Keir was about four inches shorter than he. A prison identification photograph, a copy of which was tendered by Mr Hanley, appears to show the accused at about 187 centimetres which is six foot one inch. To my eye the photographs would suggest that the difference in height is somewhat more than four inches though perhaps not very much. 
         
         
        I think Jean Keir’s height fell within the range or at least very close to it.” 
        
       
      
    79 Bones Nos. 1 to 6 were sent to Dr Atchinson in Melbourne on 16 December 1991. Bone No. 7 was retained lest some mishap befell the other six ([581]).  
     
      
    80 Dr Atchinson was able to obtain only partial results from the DNA tests he carried out on the bones. He gave evidence to the effect that because he got results that could not be interpreted, he “felt the DNA had degraded to the extent it was not reliable” (T972). Dr Atchinson said that, in 1991, he had used an analysis technique developed in his laboratory which was not a commercial kit, and could analyse only one locus at a time (T967).  
     
      
    81 On 4 August 1992, the bones were delivered to Dr Van Daal in Adelaide. She was unable to obtain a complete DNA sample. Campbell AJ noted that the South Australian State Forensic Science Service “was using a monoplex rather than the later multiplex DNA testing system” ([760]). Dr Van Daal wrote to the officer-in-charge of the investigation, noting that further developments might assist at a later time and giving costings for such work (T1291-1293). No further work was done by Dr Van Daal, and the bones were sent back to Dr Atchinson in Melbourne in July 1994. He conducted further tests, the results of which were indistinct (T970).  
     
      
    82 Campbell AJ observed at [698] that no “continuity” challenge was made concerning the bones: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is relevant to note that the ‘continuity’ that is, the identity of the bones removed from Tregear and then examined in the various laboratories including the Armed Forces DNA Identification Laboratory of the United States was not challenged.” 
        
       
      
    83 On 16 September 1997, the six bones were delivered to the Armed Forces DNA Identification Laboratory in the United States of America. Ms Nancy Ann Scibetta, from that laboratory, gave evidence at the trial by video link (T1178-1219). She said that the primary purpose of her position at the laboratory was to obtain mitochondrial DNA sequences from bones that were believed to be the remains of American soldiers who had died in World War II, the Korean War and the Vietnam War. Ms Scibetta said that her laboratory had developed special expertise in relation to bones or human remains recovered from theatres of war in difficult environments in terms of contamination, degradation and mixed human remains. It was her evidence that her laboratory was one of the best in the world for undertaking such work (T1180).  
     
      
    84 Ms Scibetta obtained a mitochondrial DNA sequence from two of the six bones which she had received, being the right big toe and the left patella fragment. They were the largest bones and came from opposite sides of the body ([704]). She explained the steps taken by her including measures taken to secure the bone samples against contamination (T1186, 1191-2). Having established that the two bones were consistent as having come from the same individual, or at least from an individual with a common maternal ancestor, Ms Scibetta extracted DNA from a blood sample given by Jean Keir’s mother, Christine Strachan, and concluded that the mitochondrial DNA obtained from Mrs Strachan’s blood sample was consistent with the mitochondrial sequence she had obtained from the two bones (T1187-1188). Ms Scibetta explained that an individual’s mitochondrial DNA is inherited from the mother and is identical to the mother’s mitochondrial DNA (T1184). 
     
      
    85 Ms Scibetta agreed that she did not necessarily know where contamination of samples such as bones and blood may have occurred from the time samples are obtained until they arrive in the laboratory. She agreed that the taped seals on the bone packets appeared not to be sticking and that there was dust, which she thought to be bone dust, in the bags (T1195, 1200). She said that she had considered the possibility that the existence of dust could be a potential contaminant. Ms Scibetta said that she was concerned about the possibility of contamination in every skeletal remains’ case (T1201-1202). However, in relation to the sanding process that she conducted as part of the cleaning procedures prior to the extraction of DNA, Ms Scibetta stated that the possibility of contamination during the process was, in her experience and opinion, “not realistic at all” (T1218-1219). 
     
      
    86 Ms Scibetta also extracted DNA from the blood of Jean Keir’s father, Gaspar Baan. DNA from two bones and the blood samples from Christine Strachan and Gaspar Baan were then given to Ms Demris Anita Lee, the technical leader of the Nuclear DNA Section of the Armed Forces DNA Identification Laboratory. Ms Lee gave evidence at the trial by audio-visual link (T1345-1370). She said the Nuclear DNA Section works on death investigations of the United States’ armed forces, and its primary focus is recent death investigations where individuals are deceased from incidents such as aircraft mishaps, explosions, motor vehicle accidents and military attacks such as gunshot wounds or bombings, as well as mass disaster incidents involving commercial airline accidents and remains recovered from the ocean floor (T1347-8).  
     
      
    87 Ms Lee explained the difference between nuclear and mitochondrial DNA (T1348-9). She obtained complete nuclear DNA profiles of the two bones, which she identified as being those of a female (T1351-1353). Campbell AJ was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Ms Lee’s procedures for obtaining complete nuclear DNA profiles of the two bones were appropriate and valid ([711]). 
     
      
    88 Ms Lee also obtained DNA profiles for Christine Strachan and Gaspar Baan from the blood samples which they had provided. Ms Lee concluded that, based on the DNA results, the bone samples were consistent with being an offspring of the two blood samples ([713]). 
     
      
    89 Ms Lee was cross-examined concerning the potential for contamination of the bones. She agreed that it was plausible that, if a specimen that had been denuded of any DNA had come into contact with another specimen such as a hand or even scalp or dandruff, the DNA could be transferred to the degraded specimen. She said, however, that in order to obtain the DNA profile from that bone, it would have to actually penetrate the bone because of the clinical procedures that had been undertaken, and that this was not possible from a touch or from dandruff (T1360). 
     
      
    90 After referring to the evidence of Ms Scibetta and Ms Lee, Campbell AJ concluded at [730]: 
     
      
       
        
        “I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the DNA extracted by Ms Scibetta was, as she firmly stated, ‘true to the bone’. I am also satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the results obtained by Ms Scibetta and Ms Lee are valid and true reflections of the bones found at Tregear. I am also satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the bones are those of a female, that their mitochondrial DNA is consistent with an offspring of Christine Strachan and that their nuclear DNA is consistent with an offspring of Christine Strachan and Gaspar Baan.” 
        
       
      
    91 His Honour was conscious that these results alone did not establish that the bones were those of Jean Keir ([731]). 
     
      
    92 Although Campbell AJ considered that the procedures adopted in the United States of America and the results obtained “exclude any effect from earlier contamination should it have occurred”, his Honour dealt with the defence submission at trial that contamination may have occurred. In particular, defence counsel submitted that testing done in Adelaide had raised issues which put in doubt the profiles established in the United States of America. Having considered the evidence as to tests which had earlier been conducted by Dr Atchinson and Dr Van Daal, his Honour concluded it was unlikely that the bones had been relevantly contaminated or that the test results excluded Gaspar Baan or Christine Strachan as potential parents ([776]). Following an examination of defence counsel’s submission concerning the possibility of contamination based upon the evidence of Dr Atchinson and Dr Van Daal ([748]-[778]), Campbell AJ expressed the following conclusion at [779]: 
     
      
       
        
        “An examination of the events at Adelaide and Melbourne does not lead me to a different conclusion to that drawn as a result of the testing in America.” 
        
       
      
    93 I agree with the Crown submission that the Appellant’s complaint that the trial Judge ignored relevant DNA evidence, or ignored the possibility of contamination of the DNA evidence upon which his Honour ultimately relied, cannot be sustained in the face of Campbell AJ’s detailed consideration of the expert evidence. Having undertaken that detailed consideration, Campbell AJ accepted the evidence given by Ms Scibetta and Ms Lee. His Honour saw and heard them give evidence and concluded that they were impressive witnesses ([701]). 
     
      
    94 Campbell AJ emphasised that an acceptance of the evidence of Ms Scibetta and Ms Lee did not, of itself, prove that the bones belonged to Jean Keir, with that question depending upon the statistical and other evidence in the case. 
     
      
    95 I have examined the evidence touching upon the question of possible contamination of DNA evidence, together with the analysis and findings of the trial Judge on this question. No error is demonstrated in his Honour’s analysis. The findings made by Campbell AJ were clearly available. In my opinion, the findings are reasonable and are supported by the evidence. The Appellant has not demonstrated any basis for this Court to intervene.  
     
      
    96 I reject Grounds 1(c) and (d). 
     
      
       
      Ground 1(e) - Verdict Unsafe and Unsatisfactory by Reason of the Trial Judge’s Wrongful Disregard of Photographic Evidence Relating to the Excavation of the Bones and the Concrete Slab  
       
      
    97 By this ground of appeal, the Appellant challenges findings of the trial Judge concerning searches and excavation of the property at 18 Wilkes Crescent, Tregear in April and May 1991, including a critical finding concerning the location of the seven bones on the latter occasion.  
     
      
       
      When Were the Bones Found 
      ? 
       
      
    98 The Appellant submits that no bones were discovered during the search undertaken between 13 and 16 April 1991. A second search was conducted from 2 May 1991 with some 30 bones being located, including animal bones and the seven human bones, six of which were later submitted for DNA analysis. The Appellant submits, in effect, that there is something sinister arising from the failure of the police to locate the bones during the April 1991 search, only to come across them at the later search. He challenges the finding of Campbell AJ based upon certain photographic evidence.  
     
      
    99 The Appellant relies upon a photograph which depicts excavation work on the western side of the house (Photograph 22). He submits that this photograph depicts the first, and not the second, search and that the trial Judge erred in relying upon this photograph as part of the finding that the bones were located during the second search in May 1991. The Appellant submits that “clearly there is something dramatically wrong here” and that Campbell AJ ought to have seen that there was a significant problem concerning this issue, but had rejected wrongfully the photographic evidence. 
     
      
    100 In the course of his oral submissions before this Court, the Appellant handed up two groups of photographs. The first group comprised six photographs (Photographs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 22) which were tendered by the Crown at trial and formed part of Exhibit B. The second group comprised four photographs which were labelled for identification during the hearing of the appeal with the letters A, B and C (with C containing two photographs). The Appellant sought to rely upon the photographs marked A, B and C as fresh evidence on the appeal. The Court heard submissions on this issue, to which I will return.  
     
      
    101 The Crown submits that the Appellant is advancing a submission which was abandoned by his counsel at trial, coupled with a further submission rejected by the trial Judge. In any event, the Crown submits that the Appellant’s argument that Photograph 22 (part of Exhibit B at trial) was taken during the first search in April 1991, and not the second search in May 1991, is contrary to the evidence. The second search was conducted from 2 May 1991 following information obtained form a prison informant who gave evidence under the pseudonym Brian Riley.  
     
      
    102 The first search had been conducted between 13 and 16 April 1991, following a fire at 18 Wilkes Crescent, Tregear and the discovery of the Appellant’s second wife, Rosalie Keir, dead inside the house ([541]). The Appellant was taken into custody in relation to the death of his second wife and, whilst housed in a correctional centre, was alleged to have had a conversation with Mr Riley, who provided information to police leading to the issue of a search warrant executed in May 1991.  
     
      
    103 According to the Crown, the Appellant appears to be suggesting, in this ground of appeal, that the seven bones were planted on the site between the first and second searches of the grounds. This was an issue that was raised but abandoned at the trial, with defence counsel suggesting to Mr Riley in cross-examination that he organised for the bones to be placed there (T592). The Crown points to Campbell AJ’s reasons at [605]-[606] where his Honour recorded the abandonment of this argument by defence counsel: 
     
      
       
        
        “Addressing first, Mr Crown was obliged to deal with this suggestion and did so very effectively. Mr Hanley in his careful address did not put an argument in support of it. In these circumstances I consider that it would be adding unnecessarily to an already overlong judgment to do more than say that I regard the suggestion as fanciful, and to dismiss it. I do not consider it to be a reasonable possibility that Riley arranged for the bones to be planted at 18 Wilkes Crescent. 
         
         
        Had the argument been pursued it might have been relevant to examine the first search in more detail because, theoretically at least, an argument could be presented that the first search was so thorough that it could be said that these bones were not then there and that they must have been put there subsequently. It is, I think, sufficient to say that I accept the evidence of Inspector Lyons that the only digging done on the western side of the house in April was a hole which he dug in an area to the northern end of the area on the western side of the house about level with the northern alignment of the house and remote from the area in which the bones were found. I also accept Mr McKay’s evidence that the area where he commenced digging was flat and showed no sign of recent digging. It was common ground that the earthmoving machinery used in the April search was too wide to proceed down the western side of the building.” 
        
       
      
    104 Accordingly, the Crown submits that the Appellant seeks, on appeal, to press an argument which his counsel did not pursue at trial.  
     
      
    105 With respect to the Appellant’s submissions by reference to photographs handed up during the appeal, the Crown observes that, in the course of his oral submissions, the Appellant contended that Photograph 22 was taken during the first search. The Crown submits that this proposition is at odds with both the evidence given at the trial, and the trial Judge’s ultimate findings, on the question of when the bones where found. 
     
      
    106 As the Appellant’s submissions in support of this ground are founded upon his claim that Photograph 22 was taken during the first search in April 1991 and not the second search in May 1991, it is appropriate to refer to evidence adduced at trial on this question and the findings of the trial Judge with respect to it. 
     
      
    107 The Crown called Peter John Seymour, a retired police officer, who in April 1991 was a Detective Senior Constable attached to the Mt Druitt Police Station. He was one of the persons responsible for the investigation into the disappearance of Jean Keir. Mr Seymour gave evidence concerning the dates on which various photographs comprised in Exhibit B were taken. Specifically, it was his evidence that Photograph 22 was taken during the second search between 1 and 8 May 1991 (T23). Mr Seymour said that nothing of relevance had been found in the course of the first search in April 1991 (T20). 
     
      
    108 The Crown called Robert George McKay, a retired police officer, who gave evidence that he attended the premises at 18 Wilkes Crescent, Tregear in the course of the second search (T903). He said that he was the first police officer who thought to go up the western side of the house and start digging up that side, following a conversation he had with a neighbour (T914). Mr McKay said that Photograph 22 depicted the area where he had started to dig, firstly by tapping the ground with the tip of a spade, until he got to an area that was soft (T906, 918). Campbell AJ summarised the evidence of Mr McKay concerning this search with led to the discovery of bones ([549]ff).  
     
      
    109 Mr McKay was cross-examined about Photograph 22 (T913, 916, 921). Campbell AJ expressed the following conclusion with respect to Mr McKay’s evidence at [555]: 
     
      
       
        
        “I was impressed by Mr McKay’s evidence. He was not one of the investigating officers and had been called in to help with the manual work of searching. I think he truthfully and accurately reported his part in the work.” 
        
       
      
    110 Campbell AJ made detailed findings concerning the discovery of the bones ([540]-[607]). His Honour was “satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the seven numbered bones were found by police at 18 Wilkes Cres in May 1991” and observed that “It has not been argued otherwise” ([574]). 
     
      
    111 Campbell AJ dismissed as “fanciful” a proposition put to Mr Riley in cross-examination but not advanced by defence counsel in closing address, that the bones had been planted between the first and second searches ([605]).  
     
      
    112 In my view, the Crown is correct in characterising the Appellant’s submission as being a resurrection of an argument which had been abandoned by his counsel at trial. In any event, no error has been demonstrated on the part of the trial Judge with respect to this issue. The additional photographs upon which the Appellant sought to rely, as fresh evidence, at the hearing of the appeal do not assist the Appellant’s argument. I am entirely unpersuaded that those photographs provide support for the Appellant’s argument that Photograph 22 depicts the first and not the second search. 
     
      
       
      The Concrete Slab Issue 
       
      
    113 The second limb relied upon by the Appellant under Ground 1(e) relates to photographic evidence concerning a concrete slab under an oil heater tank at 18 Wilkes Crescent, Tregear prior to the first search in April 1991. The Applicant submits that the photographic evidence demonstrates that this concrete slab was broken up during the first search. He submits that the slab is significant because the location of the slab would have covered most of the hole where the police allege that bones were located. He submits that disturbance of the concrete slab during the first search ought to have raised substantial doubt over the location of the bones. The Appellant submits that the trial Judge erred in his findings concerning this question based upon photographic evidence (Exhibit 19). 
     
      
    114 The Crown observes that the concrete slab argument arose only towards the end of the trial, and that Campbell AJ had dealt with it in his judgment ([608]-[694]). The Appellant alleged in his own evidence that the police had, in the course of the first search in April 1991, removed a concrete slab which had supported an oil heater tank at the side of the house and which had been over the area where the bones were located. The Appellant said that the slab had been laid some time between 1976 and 1978 by Jean Keir’s grandfather. This was the first time the Appellant had mentioned the existence of the slab, no reference having been made to it at the two previous trials. As will be seen, Campbell AJ considered the late raising of the issue as being significant.  
     
      
    115 The Crown called evidence in reply, including evidence from police who took part in the search and who never saw any such slab on the western side of the house. Campbell AJ reviewed the evidence in detail and concluded that it was “unlikely that there was a slab of concrete of the type described underneath the heater tank at the time of the first search in April 1991” ([683]). Campbell AJ observed at [686]-[687]: 
     
      
       
        
        “The time at which this issue was raised is I think significant. The accused conceded that he paid close attention to the issues and the evidence. I find it difficult to think he would have forgotten about the slab even though there are many distractions for a person in his position. Commenting only on the hearing before me, because it is the one which I have seen, its preparation has been extremely thorough and yet this issue did not emerge until a very late stage indeed in the trial. 
         
         
        What happened to the support structure does not appear. But the state in which the premises were generally left after the searches makes it clear enough that nobody would have tidied it away. None of the police officers who have given evidence saw it about, nor does it appear anywhere in the photographs or videos which have been exhibited. Mr De Beus gave evidence that his backhoe could not pass down the side of the house on the west. Neither he nor Mr Moynihan who attended on 6, 7 and 8 May 1991 with a narrower backhoe gave evidence of breaking up a slab of the type spoken of.” 
        
       
      
    116 Campbell AJ noted that the Crown had raised the possibility that the Appellant had formed the slab over the body of Jean Keir and then removed it at the time, on the Crown case, when he took her remains away leaving the seven bones behind. His Honour stated that there was “no adequate basis for making a finding to this effect” ([689]).  
     
      
    117 The conclusions of Campbell AJ at [691]-[694] involve findings adverse to the Appellant on the existence of the slab: 
     
      
       
        
        “Mr Hanley made no submission, apart from his general proposition, as to where the presence of a slab would lead. 
         
         
        I accept the evidence of Mr McKay that the ground he dug in did not have the appearance of having been recently disturbed. 
         
         
        If the earlier searchers had removed a slab, which I should make clear I do not think occurred, it would not have altered the position that there were bones in the ground. 
         
         
        Mr Hanley did not submit, one would think for good reason, that the bones found had been in situ from before 1976 or 1978 when the accused said the slab was put in. This would be very unlikely on the medical evidence.” 
        
       
      
    118 It is apparent that the trial Judge found that a concrete slab was not present at the time of the second search in May 1991. This finding was made having regard to the totality of the evidence, including the evidence of police officers and others which touched upon this issue. Campbell AJ regarded it as significant that the Appellant was raising this issue, for the first time, during his evidence near the end of the third trial. I detect no error in the findings of the trial Judge concerning this issue. I have considered the evidence touching upon this issue. His Honour’s findings were reasonable and were supported by the evidence. 
     
      
    119 Having regard to the conclusions expressed with respect to the excavation and concrete slab issues, I reject Ground 1(e).  
     
      
       
      Cumulative Effect of Matters Raised by Ground 1 
       
      
    120 I have considered separately each of the matters relied upon by the Appellant in support of Ground 1(a)-(e). In each case, I have concluded that no error has been demonstrated in the findings and conclusions of the trial Judge. In each case, the findings were reasonable and supported by the evidence. 
     
      
    121 I have considered whether the cumulative effect of the matters relied upon by the Appellant in support of Ground 1 demonstrates a basis for appellate intervention under s.6(1) Criminal Appeal Act 1912. Having undertaken that task, I do not consider that the cumulative effect of these arguments demonstrates that the verdict of guilty was unreasonable or was not supported by the evidence. 
     
      
    122 Accordingly, Ground 1 is rejected. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2 - The  
      “Prosecutor’s Fallacy” 
       Ground 
       
      
    123 The Appellant submits that Campbell AJ fell into error in his analysis of, and reliance upon, the DNA evidence giving rise to the “prosecutor’s fallacy”, and thus repeated the error which led to the quashing of the conviction at the first trial: R v Keir (2002) 127 A Crim R 198. The Appellant acknowledges that Campbell AJ addressed the “prosecutor’s fallacy”, but maintains, nevertheless, that his Honour fell into the same error. The written submissions of the Appellant in support of this ground seek also to challenge the factual findings of the trial Judge concerning the DNA evidence rather than challenge, with any precision, particular findings of his Honour which are said to be based upon the “prosecutor’s fallacy”. 
     
      
    124 The Crown submits that both the Crown and Campbell AJ were alive to the “prosecutor’s fallacy” at the trial, and that no error of this type has occurred. Further, the Crown submits that the findings of the trial Judge concerning the DNA evidence were well supported by the evidence adduced at trial. 
     
      
    125 In R v Keir (2002) 127 A Crim R 198 at 202 [22], the “prosecutor’s fallacy” was explained in the following way: 
     
      
       
        
        “The prosecutor's fallacy has most recently been considered in this Court in  
        R v G K (2001) 125 A Crim R 315 and R v Galli 
         (2001) NSWCCA 504. The first of these cases includes the following from  
        Doheny and Adams 
         (1997) 1 Cr App R369 at 372-373 - 
         
         
          
          ‘ 
          It is easy, if one eschews rigorous analysis, to draw the following conclusion: 
           
           
          (1) Only one person in a million will have a DNA profile which matches that of the crime stain. 
           
           
          (2) The defendant has a DNA profile which matches the crime stain. 
           
           
          (3) Ergo there is a million to one probability that the defendant left the crime stain and is guilty of the crime. 
           
           
          ... 
           
           
          Taking our example, the prosecutor's fallacy can be simply demonstrated. If one person in a million has a DNA profile which matches that obtained from the crime stain, then the suspect will be 1 of perhaps 26 men in the United Kingdom who share that characteristic. If no fact is known about the defendant, other than that he was in the United Kingdom at the time of the crime the DNA evidence tells us no more than that there is a statistical probability that he was the criminal of 1 in 26. 
           
           
          The significance of the DNA evidence will depend critically upon what else is known about the suspect. If he has a convincing alibi at the other end of England at the time of the crime, it will appear highly improbable that he can have been responsible for the crime, despite his matching DNA profile. If, however, he was near the scene of the crime when it was committed, or has been identified as a suspect because of other evidence which suggests that he may have been responsible for the crime, the DNA evidence becomes more significant. The possibility that two of the only 26 men in the United Kingdom with the matching DNA should have been in the vicinity of the crime will seem almost incredible and a comparatively slight nexus between the defendant and the crime, independent of the DNA, is likely to suffice to present an overall picture to the jury that satisfies them of the defendant's guilt’."" 
          
         
        
       
      
    126 The Court of Criminal Appeal identified at 202 [20]-[21] the manner in which the “prosecutor’s fallacy” had arisen at the first trial: 
     
      
       
        
        “The Crown had fallen into a version of what has come to be known as the prosecutor's fallacy. It was incorrect to move from (i) the probability of the bones being those of a child of Mrs Strachan and Mr Baan rather than of a random mating in the Australian population to (ii) the same probability that the bones were those of Mrs Keir. 
         
         
        In the appeal the Crown accepted that there was the prosecutor's fallacy, but submitted that a redirection later given rectified the error. It is therefore necessary to appreciate what the error was.” 
        
       
      
    127 The Crown submits that Campbell AJ was conscious of the “prosecutor’s fallacy” and the need to avoid it. The Crown submits that the manner in which his Honour considered the DNA evidence, and the conclusions which his Honour drew from that evidence, do not demonstrate an error of the nature which led the Court of Criminal Appeal to quash the conviction at the first trial. 
     
      
    128 As noted earlier, Campbell AJ accepted the results of the DNA testing conducted in the United States of America to the effect that the bones located at 18 Wilkes Crescent, Tregear were the bones of a female and that the mitochondrial and nuclear DNA samples taken from those bones were consistent with the DNA obtained from blood samples provided by each of Jean Keir’s parents. However, as Campbell AJ observed, that evidence of itself did not establish that the bones were those of Jean Keir. In order to determine what, if anything, the results of the DNA testing contributed to the establishment of the identity of the bones, it was necessary to look at both the statistical evidence and other evidence in the case ([731]). 
     
      
    129 The statistical evidence was given by Mr Robert Goetz. Campbell AJ observed at [732]: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        Mr Goetz is a very experienced forensic biologist employed by the Division of Analytical Laboratories in Lidcombe. There is no issue as to his qualifications to express opinions on questions relating to DNA including the use of data bases and statistical principles to develop, amongst other things, likelihood ratios.” 
        
       
      
    130 Campbell AJ outlined the steps taken by Mr Goetz with respect to the nuclear DNA profiles ([733]-[735]): 
     
      
       
        
        “Provided with the nuclear DNA profiles obtained by Ms Lee of the two bones examined and of Gaspar Baan and Christine Strachan Mr Goetz prepared a table which posed the following question: 
         
         
          
          How many times more likely to find the profile from the bone if it originated from a child of Baan and Strachan than from a child of an unknown couple in the population. The calculation also includes a correct  
          (sic) 
           for sample size (95 percent confidence limits). 
          
         
         
         
        The table then provided likelihood ratios for a considerable number of different populations with three different levels of statistical correction. 
         
         
        Referring to figures taken from New South Wales and Queensland data bases Mr Goetz gave the following evidence: 
         
         
         
          
          Q — In other words, in effect using the heading on page 1 are you saying that it is 447,000 times more likely to find the profile that Demris Lee came up with from the bone if it originated from a child of Baan and Strachan than from a child of an unknown couple in the population. 
           
           
          A — That’s correct’.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    131 The Crown submits, correctly, that the formulation of the question in this manner by the Crown prosecutor was framed deliberately to avoid the “prosecutor’s fallacy”. After reference to the evidence of Mr Goetz, Campbell AJ concluded at [741]-[742]: 
     
      
       
        
        “I consider that the evidence established that it is 400,000 times more likely that the bones tested in America originated from a child of Baan and Strachan than from a child of an unknown couple in the population. 
         
         
        I should note that it was established that Gaspar Baan and Christine Strachan were the parents of Jean Keir and that they did not jointly have another child.” 
        
       
      
    132 Thereafter, Campbell AJ gave himself a warning to avoid the “prosecutor’s fallacy” at [743]: 
     
      
       
        
        “At this point I should give myself a warning to avoid the ‘prosecutor’s fallacy’ (See  
        Doheny and Adams 
         [1997] 1 Cr App Rep 369 per Phillips LJ at 372,  
        R v Keir 
         [2002] NSWCCA 30;  
        R v GK 
         [2001] NSWCCA 413.) That fallacy arises from a course of reasoning that concludes from the likelihood discussed above that there is a 400,000 to one chance that the bones are those of Jean Keir as distinct from any other person.” 
        
       
      
    133 Both the Crown and defence counsel at the trial before Campbell AJ submitted that his Honour ought approach the matter in accordance with the summing up of Kirby J at the second trial. Campbell AJ directed himself in accordance with that summing up “as amended to delete irrelevant issues in the finding as to the likelihood ratio which I have made” ([744]).  
     
      
    134 The trial Judge said at [746]-[747]: 
     
      
       
        
        “Kirby J then went on to the use to be made of the determined ratio in combination with the other evidence. I shall come to that later. I should note that Kirby J later pointed out to the jury that the fact that the bones were of a female and an adult, as opposed to a child, would reduce the broad figures, that is, the number of such individuals. There may be other factors that should reduce that figure, however, as the trial has been conducted I do not consider that I should have regard to them. 
         
         
        I should take account of the further warning expressed in the summing up as follows: 
         
         
          
          When you approach this issue you should be aware that the use of statistics throws up what looks like a very precise figure; four hundred thousand to one; … depending upon which evidence you accept. However, the figures are based upon databases and generalisation and there can never be an exactitude in this area. 
           
           
          The task you have is of combining the likelihood ratio with other evidence, it is one that can never be reduced to a mathematical computation’.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    135 The Crown submits that the evidence of Mr Goetz, and the trial Judge’s ultimate formulation of the effect of the DNA evidence, avoided the “prosecutor’s fallacy”. His Honour concluded that it was 400,000 times more likely that the bones tested originated from a child of Mr Baan and Mrs Strachan than from a child of an unknown couple. That was the correct conclusion to draw from that evidence. It was only upon consideration of the other evidence in the case, in accordance with the reasoning process advocated in R v Doheny (1997) 1 Cr App R 369, that his Honour concluded that the bones were those of Jean Keir. The trial Judge did not commit the error which occurred at the first trial.  
     
      
    136 An examination of the approach taken by Campbell AJ to this issue demonstrates clearly that neither the Crown nor his Honour have fallen into the “prosecutor’s fallacy”. The approach of the trial Judge to this issue accords with that required by the judgment of this Court in R v Keir.  
     
      
    137 To the extent that the Appellant’s submission under this ground of appeal seeks to challenge his Honour’s reasoning process and conclusions with respect to the DNA evidence generally, that submission ought be rejected. Campbell AJ examined the evidence and made careful findings with respect to the process of DNA extraction and analysis both in Australia and in the United States of America. Having accepted the evidence of Ms Scibetta and Ms Lee, his Honour considered and accepted the evidence of Mr Goetz with respect to the statistical calculations flowing from those conclusions. His Honour avoided the “prosecutor’s fallacy”.  
     
      
    138 Importantly, Campbell AJ was conscious that the DNA evidence and statistical evidence constituted one part only of the evidence in the trial. In R v Doheny, it was stressed that the significance of DNA evidence will depend critically upon what else is known about the person to whom the DNA evidence is alleged to relate. In the present case, there was an accumulation of evidence, including the DNA evidence, which provided powerful support for a conclusion that the bones belonged to Jean Keir.  
     
      
    139 Ground 2 ought be rejected. 
     
      
       
      Ground 3 - The Trial Judge Significantly Erred in his Conclusion (a) that Jean Keir is Dead and (b) that her Death was Caused by an Act of the Appellant 
       
      
    140 In support of this ground of appeal, the Appellant submits that the evidence of the alleged sightings of Jean Keir after 9 February 1988 was “more than sufficient to have raised more than a reasonable doubt” in the manner contended by the Appellant in his submissions in support of Ground 1(a) and (b). 
     
      
    141 The Crown submits that no basis for appellate intervention is demonstrated by the Appellant for the reasons advanced by the Crown in support of these earlier grounds.  
     
      
    142 Ground 3(a), in effect, repeats the submissions advanced in support of Ground 1 which has been resolved adversely to the Appellant. I express the same conclusion with respect to the present ground. 
     
      
    143 In support of Ground 3(b), the Appellant submits that Campbell AJ erred in his conclusion that Jean Keir’s death was caused by an act of the Appellant. He submits that there is no positive identification of the alleged victim nor any body of the alleged victim. He submits that no time of the alleged death, or any cause of the alleged death, has been established. The Appellant points to the absence of forensic evidence and physical evidence demonstrating that Jean Keir was murdered, and he contends that nothing can be attributed to him in this respect. Accordingly, the Appellant submits that Campbell AJ’s conclusions are based on “speculation, suspicion and grave suspicion instead of on proven facts, facts proven beyond reasonable doubt”. 
     
      
    144 The Crown points to the following findings of Campbell AJ leading to the conclusion that the Appellant had murdered Jean Keir: 
     
      
       
      (a) there had been a period of  
      “considerable happiness” 
       following the marriage of the Appellant and Jean Keir; however, from about 1985 onwards, the relationship was deteriorating and continued to do so ([1018]); 
       
       
      (b) while the Appellant’s long hours at work, and the degree of involvement of Jean Keir’s mother in the marriage, were causes of dissatisfaction for Jean Keir ([1021]), the Appellant’s  
      “jealousy, suspicion and control were also causes of dissatisfaction” 
       ([1022]); 
       
       
      (c) by the end of 1987, the relationship between Jean Keir and the Appellant was, to use his words,  
      “stretched” 
       ([1089(a)]); 
       
       
      (d) Jean Keir had an association with Mr Carl Neiding, which had involved sexual intercourse of which the Appellant was aware ([1089(b)]); 
       
       
      (e) in February 1988, Jean Keir had gone to Culburra to, in the Appellant’s words,  
      “get herself sorted out” 
       ([1089(d)]); 
       
       
      (f) on 9 February 1988, the Appellant went to Culburra to bring his wife home to Wilkes Crescent, Tregear; in an interview with a journalist, the Appellant said he had done so because  
      “well, if she had problems to sort out, she couldn’t sort them out miles away, there’ve um got to be sorted out at home” 
       ([1089(e)]); 
       
       
      (g) the trial Judge found that Jean Keir did not want to come home from Culburra, but that the Appellant sought to bring her home against her will and used a  
      “moderate degree of force to that end” 
       ([1090]); 
       
       
      (h) on the way home, Jean Keir fled from the Appellant and went to the home of Mr Carl Neiding, without telling the Appellant, and leaving it to him to discover that she had gone ([1091]): 
       
       
      (i) the Appellant contacted Mr Neiding, and asked him to bring his wife home, a direction with which Mr Neiding complied ([1094]); 
       
       
      (j) Jean Keir was met by the Appellant at 18 Wilkes Crescent, Tregear and went into the house; Campbell AJ found that, except for the alleged sightings and the Appellant’s own evidence,  
      “there is no basis for concluding that Jean Keir was ever seen or heard from again by her family, her friends or the services of the Government” 
       ([1095]); 
       
       
      (k) seven bones were located in a search of the grounds at 18 Wilkes Crescent, Tregear in May 1999 and six bones were subjected to DNA extraction and analysis; DNA samples obtained from those bones were consistent with the DNA sample obtained from blood samples taken from Jean Keir’s parents; statistical evidence was given that it was 400,000 times more likely to find the DNA profile obtained from the bones if it originated from a child of Christine Strachan and Gaspar Baan than from a child of an unknown couple in the population ([735]-[739]). 
       
      
    145 Campbell AJ then made the following findings at [1099]-[1100]: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is my view that the only reasonable inference to be drawn from these circumstances, taken together with the other findings I have made, is that the bones are those of Jean Keir, that she is dead and that her death was caused by an act of the accused on or about 9 February 1988. I am satisfied that the Crown has proved beyond reasonable doubt that Jean Angela Keir is dead and that her death was caused by an act of the accused on or about 9 February 1988. 
         
         
        It is also my view that the only reasonable inference to be drawn from these circumstances, taken together with the other findings I have made, is that at the time of carrying out that act, the accused intended to kill Jean Keir or cause her grievous bodily harm. I am satisfied that the Crown has proved beyond reasonable doubt that at the time of carrying out that act, the accused intended to kill Jean Angela Keir or cause her grievous bodily harm.” 
        
       
      
    146 The Crown submits that it is clear from the process of reasoning set out above that the conclusions of Campbell AJ that Jean Keir is dead, and that her death was caused by an act of the Appellant, were clearly open on the evidence adduced at trial. The fact that no body was ever located does not, the Crown submits, detract from the force of the circumstantial evidence led in the case against the Appellant. The force of the evidence was further strengthened by the discovery of the seven bones buried in the grounds of the home shared by the Appellant and Jean Keir, and the DNA evidence obtained with respect to those bones. His Honour’s conclusion that the only reasonable inference to be drawn in this case was that Jean Keir was dead and that her death was caused by an act of the Appellant, carried out with the requisite intent for murder, was, on all of the evidence taken together, clearly open to the trial Judge. 
     
      
    147 I am satisfied that the findings of the trial Judge, challenged in this ground of appeal, were open on the evidence. The findings were reasonable and supported by the evidence and no basis has been demonstrated by the Appellant for intervention by this Court under s.6(1) Criminal Appeal Act 1912. 
     
      
    148 I reject Ground 3. 
     
      
       
      Ground 4 - The Trial Judge Erroneously and Wrongfully Allowed Suspicion, Grave Suspicion and Speculation to Cloud his Judgment in his Fact-Finding Mission Throughout the Trial and in his Judgment, which Dramatically Affected his Formulation in Reasoning to his Conclusion, Resulting in a Miscarriage of Justice 
       
      
    149 This ground of appeal overlaps substantially, if not entirely, with Ground 3. The Appellant submits that, despite giving himself appropriate warnings, Campbell AJ did not look at the evidence or approach his task dispassionately and impartially and without permitting himself to be influenced by prejudice or by sympathy. The Appellant submits that this must flow from his Honour’s findings and conclusions which, so the Appellant contends, were made despite the absence of evidence to support such findings and conclusions. 
     
      
    150 The Appellant repeats submissions made in support of other grounds that there was sightings’ evidence which ought to have led to an acquittal. So, the Appellant submits, the trial Judge was moved by “suspicion, grave suspicion and speculation” in reaching a verdict of guilty, thereby resulting in a miscarriage of justice. 
     
      
    151 The Crown submits that these arguments add nothing to those advanced in support of earlier grounds, apart from an unsupported and unsupportable allegation that the trial Judge failed to approach his task dispassionately and impartially and without influence by prejudice and sympathy. The Crown submits that the factual matters advanced by the Appellant in support of this ground ought be rejected for reasons previously expressed. The Crown submits that the lengthy and careful reasons of the trial Judge conformed with the requirement of s.133 Criminal Procedure Act 1986.  
     
      
    152 It is apparent from the judgment of Campbell AJ, a most experienced trial Judge, that his Honour had to the forefront of his considerations the onus and standard of proof and the requirement for the Crown to prove the Appellant’s guilt of murder by reliance upon probative evidence ([12]). His Honour gave himself appropriate directions concerning the elements of the crime of murder ([17]-[19]). 
     
      
    153 For reasons given with respect to earlier grounds of appeal, the Appellant has not demonstrated a basis for appellate intervention by this Court with respect to the factual matters relied on by him on this appeal. Insofar as the Appellant contends that the verdict of the trial Judge was based upon suspicion, and not evidence, I reject the submission. His Honour outlined in detail the evidentiary foundation leading to the conclusion that the Appellant was guilty of the murder of Jean Keir. The Crown case was a circumstantial one. There was ample foundation for his Honour’s conclusions arising from the evidence adduced at trial.  
     
      
    154 I reject Ground 4. 
     
      
       
      Ground 5 - The Trial Judge Significantly Erred in Departing from the Firm Ground of  
      “Proof Beyond Reasonable Doubt” 
       Which Dramatically Affected his Formulation in Reasoning to his Conclusions and Resulted in a Miscarriage of Justice 
       
      
    155 Under this ground of appeal, the Appellant draws together the arguments advanced in support of earlier grounds.  
     
      
    156 At the commencement of his reasons, Campbell AJ repeated the general directions given by Kirby J at the second trial, which both the Crown and defence counsel at this trial agreed were still applicable. Campbell AJ reiterated at [12] an orthodox direction given by Kirby J to the following effect: 
     
      
       
        
        “The second fundamental principle is that everything which the Crown is required to prove must be proved to your satisfaction beyond reasonable doubt. In respect of every offence, the law defines the particular matters which the Crown must prove before an accused person can be found guilty of that offence. These are usually referred to as the elements of the offence, the charge. … A person may not be convicted unless each of the separate elements of the charge is proved beyond reasonable doubt. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Any matter which must be established, as one of the elements of the charge, is not proved unless it is established to that very high standard, that is, beyond reasonable doubt. Suspicion, even grave suspicion, is not enough. The Crown, to succeed against Mr Keir, must establish his guilt beyond reasonable doubt.” 
        
       
      
    157 The Crown submits that the trial Judge directed himself in this way and acted in accordance with these directions. Aside from the reference to a failure to find the elements of the offence of murder proved beyond reasonable doubt, the Crown submits that this final ground of appeal raises the same issues as were raised in relation to Ground 1. 
     
      
    158 The Crown submits that, as with Ground 1, Ground 5 ought be rejected. 
     
      
    159 In reality, Ground 5 repeats earlier submissions in support of an argument that the verdict of guilty was unreasonable and cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence. In effect, the Appellant contends that he has demonstrated a foundation for his appeal to be allowed and the conviction quashed under s.6(1) Criminal Appeal Act 1912. 
     
      
    160 I have made my own independent assessment of the evidence adduced at trial and of the reasons of the trial Judge leading to his verdict that the Appellant was guilty of the murder of Jean Keir. The detailed reasons of the trial Judge do not involve any error of fact or law. The Appellant’s challenge is to the ultimate finding of guilt which, the Appellant contends, is not reasonable and is not supported by the evidence.  
     
      
    161 The fact of Jean Keir’s death may be proved, as any other fact, by reliance upon circumstantial evidence: Peacock v The King (1911) 13 CLR 619 at 630. In this case, as with most, the Appellant’s intention was to be proved by inference: Shepherd v The Queen (1990) 170 CLR 573 at 580. In R v Cable (1947) 47 SR (NSW) 183 at 184, Jordan CJ observed that, in many cases, circumstantial evidence is stronger than direct evidence, the latter being subject to the fallibility of human observation and recollection. As Kirby J observed in De Gruchy v The Queen [2002] 211 CLR 85 at 97 [48], circumstantial evidence calls upon processes of reasoning that involve the drawing of inferences from a jigsaw of established facts, with circumstantial evidence capable of being stronger than direct evidence.  
     
      
    162 In my opinion, the Crown case against the Appellant was strong. It was based on several pieces of evidence which left it clearly open to the trial Judge to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Jean Keir was dead, and that she had died as a result of an act of the Appellant carried out with the intention to kill or cause grievous bodily harm. The evidence of alleged sightings of Jean Keir relied upon by the Appellant was, as the trial Judge concluded, tenuous and flawed and not such as to suggest a reasonable possibility that Jean Keir was still alive. 
     
      
    163 This is not a case where the remains of Jean Keir were never found. The forensic and scientific evidence demonstrated that her remains had been buried in the grounds of the matrimonial home of the Appellant and Jean Keir some three years prior to their discovery in May 1991. 
     
      
    164 I have regard to the fact that the trial Judge observed the witnesses giving evidence, and has taken those observations into account in his findings with respect to the credibility and reliability of witnesses in reaching his verdict. This Court does not have that advantage. An examination of the record of the trial, however, demonstrates a clear foundation for his Honour to make the findings and reach the conclusions contained in the judgment.  
     
      
    165 The Crown presented a circumstantial case against the Appellant. The DNA evidence was most significant. It was open to his Honour to conclude that the bones buried in the grounds of the matrimonial home at 18 Wilkes Crescent, Tregear were those of Jean Keir. The totality of the circumstances surrounding the disappearance of Jean Keir, and the burial of her remains in the grounds of the matrimonial home, provided a powerful foundation for the conclusion that she had died at the hands of the Appellant who had then buried her, initially at least, in those grounds.  
     
      
    166 It was open to the trial Judge to conclude, on all the evidence, that the only reasonable inference was that Jean Keir died as a result of an act of the Appellant, and that the Appellant acted at the time with the intention of killing her or causing her grievous bodily harm. Campbell AJ sentenced the Appellant upon the basis that he acted with intent to cause grievous bodily harm: R v Keir [2004] NSWSC 1194 at [27]. 
     
      
    167 I am not persuaded that there is a significant possibility that an innocent person has been convicted in the present case. The collective ground of appeal does not, in my opinion, possess any greater strength than the sum of its individual parts. 
     
      
    168 This Court is a court of error. It does not proceed by way of rehearing in a way that permits it to substitute its own findings of fact for those of the trial Judge. Having exercised the appellate function under s.6(1) Criminal Appeal Act 1912, I am satisfied that the verdict of guilty of murder was reasonable and supported by the evidence and that no miscarriage of justice has resulted. 
     
      
    169 I propose that the appeal against conviction be dismissed. 
     
      
    170 LATHAM J: I agree with Johnson J.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ AT CL: I agree with Howie J. 
     
      
    2 HOWIE J: The appellant, who is unrepresented before this Court, was convicted after trial by jury of an offence that on or about 22 March 2005 he attempted to possess goods that had been imported into Australia in contravention of the Customs Act being narcotic goods consisting of a quantity of heroin of not less than the trafficable quantity for that drug. The trial was conducted before Judge Ainslie-Wallace (the Judge) and the appellant was represented by counsel. As a consequence of his conviction the appellant was sentenced to imprisonment for six years with a non-parole period of four years. The appellant is eligible for release to parole on 21 March 2009. 
     
      
    3 The form of Notice of Appeal completed by the appellant indicates that he is appealing against both his conviction and sentence. The grounds of appeal filed and the written submissions he has placed before the Court refer mainly to his conviction. In effect the appellant contends that the conviction was unreasonable in light of a number of matters that he has raised as grounds of appeal. They are as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        1. The police warrant for interception of telecommunications the Crown used against me which was an intercepted public telephone call has nothing to do with me, it has to do with another Nigerian male who lives in the vicinity of the public telephone area. 
         
         
        2. My name is never mentioned in the conversation and the police did not use visual surveillance evidence or direct voice identification evidence that would connect me to the call. 
         
         
        3. I was not in possession of drug or any documentation relating to the relevant post box and EMS postal tracking results or mobile phone registration. 
         
         
        4. The search of my house residence did not locate any paraphernalia associated with drug trafficking or supply and there is no evidence that I have the capacity to distribute drugs. 
        
       
      
    4 There is one further ground that presumably relates to his sentence being: 
     
      
       
        
         
        5. I had no criminal record or previous conviction and was relatively youthful (20 years old) at the time. 
         
        
       
      
    5 The Crown case was that on 28 January 2005 Australian Federal Police lawfully intercepted telephone calls made from a public telephone at Wolli Creek in Sydney. The target of the warrant permitting the interception of the calls was a Nigerian man but not the appellant. The calls were made in a language spoken in Nigeria. The caller, who identified himself as Obasanjo, spoke with a person overseas, identified as Acho, who told him that the place they were using was India and not Brazil and that he would ""feed"" Obasanjo. Obasanjo gave him an e-mail address so that he could send him the ""number"" and they both could ""monitor its movement on the machine"". The e mail address was “obj25@yahoo.com” 
     
      
    6 In another call on that day Obasanjo gave the other speaker, identified as Fedamatic, a telephone number. That service was registered in the name of James Morrisey of 15 John Street, Ashfield. Subsequent inquiries found that no person by that name lived at that address 
     
      
    7 The Tempe Newsagency was run by Mr and Mrs Colman. As part of the business they operated a number of private mailboxes that were located outside the newsagency on the street. Mail was delivered to the newsagency and received by the Colmans who placed it into the appropriate mailbox. If a package was too large to fit into a mailbox, it was held behind the counter and a notification put into the mailbox. 
     
      
    8 On 14 February 2005 Mrs Colman had a conversation with a person who indicated that he wished to renew Box 13. Mrs Colman received money from him and renewed the rental. The transaction was captured on a security camera that recorded visual images but not sound. 
     
      
    9 One 22nd March 2005 a parcel was delivered to the newsagency addressed to Joe Michael 13/727 Princes Highway. The parcel had been sent by Express Mail Service (“EMS”) from India. Australia Post operated a website where items sent by EMS could be tracked by reference to an ""item number"". Mrs Colman took delivery of the parcel and put it beneath the counter. She later contacted the Australian Federal Police. 
     
      
    10 Shortly thereafter the appellant, who Mrs Colman said was the same man who had renewed post box number 13 in February, came into the newsagency and said, ""Box 13"". Mrs Colman replied, ""The police have been in and picked up this parcel"". The appellant responded, ”Oh” and Mrs Colman repeated, ""The police have the parcel"". The appellant then said, ""Oh, okay, okay, yeah"" and then left the shop quickly. This transaction was also captured on the security camera. It was open to the jury to conclude that the actions of the appellant captured on the video at the time of this conversation, were suspicious. 
     
      
    11 There was no dispute at the trial that the appellant had attended the newsagency on 22nd March and asked for Box 13. It was also conceded that it was the appellant who was recorded on the videotape of the security camera for that day. It was disputed that the appellant had been the person who had renewed the rental of the box. 
     
      
    12 After the appellant left the newsagency, Mrs Colman again rang the Federal police. At about 9 a.m. Federal Agents attended the newsagency and collected the parcel. It was taken to police headquarters where it was opened and two plastic bags were found inside a book. They contained just over 197 grams of powder. The powder was later found to contain pure heroin weighing 108 grams. 
     
      
    13 Federal police then returned to the area near the newsagency and commenced surveillance. About 1.25 p.m. the appellant was stopped and spoken to. He said that he lived at unit 2/24 Clarence St, Rockdale. He was asked to show the contents of his pockets and removed two mobile phones - one a Sagem and the other a Sony Ericsson. He was asked why he had two mobile phones and the appellant shrugged his shoulders. He was allowed to walk away but was followed by police. He was seen to enter a store where he made a number of telephone calls. A short time later he was arrested. 
     
      
    14 On 20 April 2005 police showed Mrs Colman a photo board containing twelve photographs of dark-skinned males including one of the appellant. Mrs Colman marked a photograph that was not the appellant indicating that this might have been the person who came to pick up the parcel. She also told police, ""They all look the same"". 
     
      
    15 The two mobile phones taken from the appellant were later examined. Data obtained from the SIM card found inside the Sagem phone included the SMS text ""this is my emil ad. obj25 yahoo.com”. This was the e mail address given by Obasanjo in the telephone conversation intercepted by Federal police from the public telephone at Wolli Creek. 
     
      
    16 The Sagem mobile phone was registered to “James Tan” of 5 John Street, Ashfield. The Sony Ericsson was registered to “Rick Martin” of 15 John Street, Ashfield. Neither person was known at those addresses. 
     
      
    17 The appellant declined to participate in an interview with police following his arrest and did not give evidence before the jury. Therefore there was no explanation by the appellant for his actions in going to the newsagency shortly after the parcel had been delivered and inquiring about Box 13. 
     
      
    18 In summing up the judge told the jury that the ""real dispute in this matter ………is that the accused attempted to take possession of the heroin"". In order to prove that matter the Crown relied upon a circumstantial case and the Judge gave the jury the usual direction that, before they could convict the accused, they must be satisfied that there was no other reasonable explanation open on the facts other than that the appellant knew that the parcel contained drugs when he attempted to obtain possession of it. 
     
      
    19 In that regard the judge said this in the summing up: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “The evidence on which the Crown relies to prove the accused's knowledge is: the contents of the telephone call of 28 January from the phone box in Wolli Creek to a person who is referred to as Acho and later to a person referred to as Fedamatic, I will come back later and discuss these with you. The Crown relies on the e-mail address found on the Sagem phone whichj was taken from the accused when he was arrested and the billing address for that Sagem phone that was taken from the accused. The Crown relies on the billing address for the Ericsson phone that was also taken from the accused when he was arrested. The Crown relies on the phone number given to Acho in the conversation on 28 January 2005 and the billing address for that phone number which was the same as the billing address for the phone found on the accused when he was arrested. 
         
         
        The Crown relies on the evidence of the EMS parcel tracking system about which you have heard. The Crown relies on the evidence of Mrs Colman that on 22nd March the accused came into the newsagency and said to her ‘Box 13’. 
         
         
        The Crown relies on the evidence of Mrs Colman that the accused came into the newsagency after the parcel had been delivered and the evidence of Mrs Colman that she had received the parcel earlier and had put it away in the newsagency until it was collected by [a Federal police officer]. 
         
         
        The Crown relies on the behaviour of the accused as seen on the closed circuit TV. The Crown relies on the fact that the lease on Box 13 was taken out in the name of Stephen Michael using a driver's license number that did not exist and the mobile phone number given was in the name of Patrick. The Crown relies on the video footage of the man who attended the newsagency on 14 February 2005 to renew the [lease] for the box and the Crown says that it was the accused.” 
         
        
       
      
    20 In relation to the two telephone calls made from the Wolli Creek phone box the Judge said this: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “To prove that the accused is the person talking on the phone call the Crown says that there are events and activities taken by the accused after the phone call which would cause you to accept that he was the person on the phone that he was speaking first to Acho and then to Fedamatic. For example, the Crown says that the person calling from Australia was speaking Ibo, the language of the people of Nigeria. When speaking to Acho the caller gives a telephone number on which he can be contacted and that number is registered to the same address as the Ericsson phone the accused had with him when he was arrested. In the first call to Acho the caller gives an e-mail address which is the same as that found on the Sagem phone taken from the accused when he was arrested………” 
        
       
       
      The Judge directed the jury that, before they could use these phone calls as part of the Crown case against the accused, they had to be satisfied that it was the accused who made the telephone calls and that he was talking about drugs. 
       
      
    21 As to the renewal of the post box on 14 February the Judge told the jury: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “…………It is the Crown case that it was the accused who went into the newsagency on 14 February and paid for a three-month renewal of the lease of Box 13. It is disputed that it is the accused. In order to resolve the dispute you are entitled to look at the CCTV footage of 14 February. You are entitled to compare that with the CCTV footage of 22nd March. And you are entitled to compare the person who appears in the footage on 14th February with the accused, who is sitting in front of you, and you must determine whether it is the accused who came into renew the lease or not. Once again if you are satisfied that it was the accused who renewed the lease then you may use that evidence as part of the Crown case against the accused. If you are not satisfied that it was the accused then you would put that aside and you could not use that in determining whether the Crown had proved its case against the accused beyond reasonable doubt.” 
        
       
      
    22 The competing cases put before the jury were summarised by her Honour as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “It is the Crown case that the accused arranged for drugs to be sent by post to Australia and that the path of the parcel could be tracked using the EMS posting system. The Crown case is that the accused extended the lease on the post box and did it for the parcel to be delivered. 
         
         
        The Crown case is that the accused knew on the morning of 22nd March that the parcel had been delivered by Australia Post and that he came to the newsagency and asked for the contents of Box 13 knowing that the parcel contained drugs and he wanted to take possession of it. It is the Crown case that he knew that it had been delivered. 
         
         
        Now it is the case for the accused that he knew nothing of the contents of the parcel nor did he attempt to take possession of it. The case for the accused is that his words to Mrs Colman ‘Box 13’ are merely a request for information about it and not asking her to hand over the parcel. 
         
         
        It was never suggested that it was the accused who took out the lease in the first place on Box 13 in which the false driver's licence was given. It was suggested to you that his behaviour, as can been seen on the closed circuit TV filmed on 22nd March is one of confusion and is consistent with being confused. It is the case for the accused that he did not make the phone call on 28 January and the defence case was that you could not be satisfied that the accused put the e-mail address on the Sagem phone because the dates were uncertain and you could not be sure that he did that. 
         
         
        It is the defence case that he had nothing to do with the sending of drugs from India to Australia. The defence pointed out to you when the accused was searched on the day and later when his house was searched, nothing was found that would connect him with the posting of drugs or anything to do with the parcel that was sent to Mrs Colman's post box.” 
        
       
      
    23 After the jury had retired to consider its verdict a note was sent from them to the judge with the following question: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “In respect of the phone transcript if there may be doubt as to the accused's being the speaker can we still consider the other linkages to the accused contained in the phone conversation and the phone found in his possession?"" 
        
       
       
      The Judge answered the jury’s question the next day as follows: 
       
        
         
        “As I said to you yesterday, the evidence of the phone conversation is one of the pieces of evidence on which the Crown relies. And from which the Crown asked you to conclude beyond reasonable doubt that the accused knew that there were drugs in the parcel. If you decide that the accused is the speaker in the telephone calls then you may use the transcript of the phone conversations as part of the evidence in the Crown case and you may take into account in determining whether the Crown has proved beyond reasonable doubt that the accused knew there were drugs in the parcel. 
         
         
        If you decide that the accused was not the speaker in the telephone conversations then you cannot use it as part of the evidence on which the Crown relies to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the accused knew that there were drugs in the parcel.” 
        
       
      
    24 The appellant filed written submissions with the Court. Firstly he submitted that the Court should not use the contents of the intercepted telephone call on the 28th of January against him because it could not be satisfied as to the identity of the speaker on the Sydney end of the call for the following reasons: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “a. I was not the ""target"" of the interceptions, another Nigerian male living in the vicinity of the intercepted public telephone box was the intended target. 
         
         
        b. My name is never mentioned in the conversation. 
         
         
        c. The Crown did not adduce visual surveillance evidence or direct voice identification evidence connecting me to the call. 
         
         
        d. Clearly audible sounds of background conversations from page 5 of the transcript, together with discernible differences in pitch and lexicon in the voice attributed to “Obasanjo” founds the inference that more than one person was speaking at the Sydney end of the calls itself based on the contents of calls for example, given that background conversation is first audible at the top of page 5 of the transcript (9 min 15 sec into the recording) the possibility that a second person joined the first speaker at the phone box at that point of time is reasonably open on the evidence. There is no safe basis upon which the earlier part of the conversation could be attributed to the second speaker. 
         
         
        2. I would respectfully disagree with the Crown's submission that “the jury appears to have been satisfied that it was me, who arranged by telephone for the parcel to be shipped into Australia”. The note from the jury late in the trial suggesting doubts about the identity of the speakers cannot properly be used to found the submission. It was possible for the jury to convict me without needing to be satisfied that I was “Obasanjo” in the calls. 
         
         
        3. Second, the court could not be satisfied that the said calls relate to the prohibited imports which were subject of the charge. “Acho” tells “Obasanjo” that he will feed you one thing by next week… I will give you everything next week (p4) the package that was the subject of the charge arrived on 22 March 2005, ie almost 8 weeks after the call. The only reasonable inference in the circumstances is that the (sic) did not relate to the subject importation. 
        
       
      
    25 The applicant’s written submissions dealt generally with the case against him as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “(a) the Crown did not allege at trial that I was (sic) attended the newsagency prior to 14 February 2005 to rent ""Box 13"". Indeed, evidence supports the inference that another person filled out the initial rental application card. 
         
         
        (b) the search of my house residence did not locate any paraphernalia associated with drug trafficking or supply. It is submitted that there is no evidence that I had the capacity to distribute the drugs. 
         
         
        (c) there was no evidence that I was (sic) possessed significant assets or benefited financially in some way as a result of drug-related activities. 
         
         
        (d) there was no allegation that I was or had recruited others into criminal activity. 
         
         
        (e) there is evidence of another person's involvement in relation to the heroin shipment seized by police. In particular: 
         
        
       
      
    · Another Nigerian male living near the newsagency was the target of the said telephone interception 
     
      
       
        
       
      
    · Evidence pointed to another person initially renting ""Box 13"" 
     
      
       
        
       
      
    · It would seem that there was more than one person speaking on the phone on 28 January 2005.” 
     
      
    26 At the hearing of the appeal the applicant supplemented his submissions with another document. I have perused the document and it is to a large extent merely repetitious of matters that he already relied upon. However he does raise two matters additional to the dot points set out above as follows: 
     
      
       
        
       
      
    · Ms Colman at a number of points in her evidence asserted that a male had attempted to collect the parcel before police arrived and seized it. 
     
      
    · Ms Colman gave evidence that all black men appeared the same to her. 
     
      
    27 All of the points raised by the appellant were raised on his behalf before the jury. They were matters to be taken into account by the jury in determining whether the circumstances relied upon by the Crown gave rise to the only possible inference that the appellant went to the newsagency intending to collect the parcel knowing it contained drugs. The question for this Court is whether the jury were entitled to make that finding by considering all the evidence in the trial as a whole including the evidence that favoured the accused, such as his good character. 
     
      
    28 There was an application made to the Judge that she should exclude the evidence of the telephone calls obtained under the authority of the warrant. The application was based upon a submission that the warrant should have been restricted by reason of the fact that it was attached to a public phone so to limit its operation to those calls involving the target of the investigation and the person mentioned in the warrant. The Judge rejected that application indicating that she would later give reasons. There have been no formal reasons published. 
     
      
    29 At the hearing of the appeal the appellant handed up to the Court the submissions made by his counsel to the Judge in support of the argument that she should reject the evidence of the intercepted conversations. In effect the argument was that the warrant was bad on its face because it was “impermissibly broad” or “excessively wide”. The submission was that because the warrant authorised the police to intercept calls made from a public telephone box over a 90 day period, it was in effect a general warrant and this was not permissible under the relevant legislation. Reliance was placed upon a number of decisions but in particular on the judgment of Temby AJ in Warner v Elder (NSWSC, unreported, 23 April 1997) and the Court of Appeal’s decision in MacGibbon v Warner (1997) 98 A Crim R 450. 
     
      
    30 These decisions concerned a search warrant issued in respect of the Royal Commission into the NSW Police Service often known as “the Wood Royal Commission”. The facts before the Court were very different from that in the present case and the authorities relied upon were of significance for no more than a proposition that a warrant could be struck down by collateral attack upon the basis that it was a general warrant and, therefore, invalid on its face. 
     
      
    31 Although the Judge has not given formal written reasons, in admitting the conversations she stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “I do not propose to exclude the evidence obtained under the telephone intercept warrant. In my view it is not bad for being a generally (sic) warrant, and it is therefore valid and I will deliver reasons for that judgment later on in the trial.” 
        
       
      
    32 The finding made by the judge is probably the resolution of a question of law, but I am not satisfied that her Honour erred in forming that opinion on the material before her. The offence being investigated was a conspiracy to import drugs and it was open for the person authorising the warrant to come to the view that, in order to properly investigate the allegation, it was necessary for the police to be able to listen to all conversations to sift those that might be relevant to the charge whether those conversations were made by the person named in the warrant or not. The issue was not argued before this Court but I am prepared to assume in the appellant’s favour that such a warrant could be struck down on this basis. However, I do not believe that the warrant was unreasonable, or impermissibly broad or for any other reason should have been found to be invalid. 
     
      
    33 It should be noted that no other objection was raised to the admission of the telephone conversations based upon any provisions of the Evidence Act or otherwise. 
     
      
    34 There are in my view, and with respect, some unsatisfactory aspects of the summing up. I do not believe that the Judge ever answered the jury’s question or at least not in a way that might have been clearly understood by the jury. The jury wanted to know whether, if they had a doubt about the appellant being the speaker on the telephone under the sobriquet of Obasanjo, they could “still consider the other linkages to the accused contained in the phone conversation and the phone found in his possession”. This is obviously a reference to the fact that there were aspects of those mobile phones that related back to the conversations in the phone box: the reference to the e mail address and the similarity of the registered addressed for the Ericsson phone and the number used in the second conversation. 
     
      
    35 There were in my view two aspects of the question that needed to be clearly addressed. Firstly the use of the jury of the word “doubt” seems to me to suggest that they believed that they had to be satisfied of the fact that the applicant was one of the parties to the conversations beyond reasonable doubt. The jury should have been clearly told that they did not have to find that the appellant was a party to those conversations to that standard of proof. Secondly, the jury had to be plainly told, on the view that the Judge and the parties took, that, if they were not satisfied that he was a party to the conversations, the fact that he had those particular mobile phones was irrelevant. They could not make any link between the appellant and the person on the phone by reason of those particular mobile phones. 
     
      
    36 Yet the Judge merely repeated in a formalistic way what she had said earlier in the summing up, that had presumably not been fully understood by the jury. True it may be that, by examining and parsing what the Judge said with the aid of the transcript of her answer, one might by inference derive the answer to the jury’s question, but I doubt it conveyed to the jury what they wanted to know. 
     
      
    37 But of more concern is the fact that the Judge never explained to the jury in precise terms what was left of the Crown’s circumstantial case if the transcript of the telephone conversations could not be relied upon. Yet those conversations and the significance of the mobile phones found in the possession of the appellant was a very important part of the Crown case. The prosecution case would have been very substantially reduced by the omission of the transcript of the telephone calls. The case would then have been based only upon the following facts: that the applicant turned up at the newsagency to renew the lease for three months in circumstances where he was not the original lessee and the extension happened to cover the period when the parcel arrived; the fact that he arrived soon after the parcel was delivered which would show that he had received information that the parcel had arrived; his request for the parcel; and his reaction to the news that the parcel had been taken by police including his behaviour as seen on the video. 
     
      
    38 I am not to be taken to suggest that this was not sufficient evidence to prove the Crown case, but it ought to have been brought home to the jury that, if they omitted the evidence of the transcript of the telephone calls, they had to be satisfied that there was no other inference from the remaining facts other than that the appellant knew the parcel contained drugs. However, defence counsel made no complaint about the directions to the jury, which were probably overly favourable to the appellant. I doubt that the transcript of the telephone calls was inadmissible as part of the surrounding circumstances even if the appellant was not the speaker. But the Crown was prepared to conduct its case on the basis that, if the jury were not satisfied that the appellant was a party to those conversations, they should be ignored. 
     
      
    39 However, in my view it was open to the jury to find that the appellant was the speaker “Obasanjo” and that is a finding I would make. This fact was being used merely as a circumstance to prove the offence against the appellant and not as direct evidence of the offence. Therefore it did not have to be proved beyond reasonable doubt. The jury were entitled to reason backwards, as it were, to identify the appellant as the speaker in those conversations. The conversations on 28 January referred to matters that were connected to the mobile phones the appellant later had in his possession and related to drugs coming from India. He had those phones when he went to obtain a package on 22 March that contained drugs and came from India. The appellant came to pick up the parcel very shortly after it arrived indicating that he must have had information about its delivery. The first conversation referred to the means of monitoring the parcel’s progress. He had also been to the newsagency to renew the lease on the post box on 14 February. He extended the lease even though he was not the person who had taken out the lease initially. The lease was extended to a point past the delivery date of the parcel. 
     
      
    40 As has been noted the appellant never gave an account of his involvement in obtaining the parcel consistent with his innocence. This did not mean that the jury did not have to consider whether there might have been a possible innocent explanation consistent with the proved facts, but when none is proffered by an accused, it is easier for the jury to decide in favour of the Crown that no other possible explanation exists. 
     
      
    41 On the circumstances that I have set out I believe a finding that the appellant attended the newsagency in order to take possession of the package knowing it contained drugs was not unreasonable or against the weight of the evidence. 
     
      
    42 The fact that the package arrived some 8 weeks after the phone call does not seem to me to be a relevant factor. It would not matter that the calls were not in relation to the particular package delivered to the newsagency. It was the connection between a person speaking about the importation of drugs from India and the telephones in the possession of the appellant at a time when on the Crown case he went to collect a package coming from India that had drugs inside it that was the relevant circumstance. 
     
      
    43 The fact that there was nothing found in a search of the appellant’s premises to connect him with the importation or distribution of drugs was a relevant circumstance for the jury to take into account. But that fact did not necessarily displace the other circumstances indicating the appellant’s guilt. Similarly the absence of any evidence to indicate that the appellant had significant assets or the apparent profits from drug trafficking or that he was involved in some other way in criminal activity was merely part of the circumstances that had to be considered along side those relied upon by the Crown. 
     
      
    44 It was not part of the Crown case that the appellant had been the original hirer of Box 13. Nor did it have to be. There was evidence upon which the jury could find that the appellant did secure the extension of the rental of the box and they had the two videotapes to consider. But again the Crown case would not fail simply because the jury were not satisfied that it was the appellant who visited the newsagency on the date the lease was extended. 
     
      
    45 In the end the significant facts were that the appellant happened to turn up at the newsagency shortly after the package containing drugs imported from India had been delivered, asked for Box 13 from the newsagent and when arrested had mobile phones in his possession which were related to the conversations from Wolli Creek phone box which involved the importation of a substance from India. In my opinion those facts alone were sufficient to justify the jury’s verdict and proved the case against the appellant beyond reasonable doubt. In addition the jury were entitled to take into account his conduct at the newsagency including that, when he was told that the police had the package, he made no inquiry about what package was being spoken about but immediately left the newsagency. 
     
      
    46 I would dismiss the appeal against conviction. 
     
      
    47 The sentence was well within the range appropriate for the offence committed notwithstanding the applicant’s prior good character. It has often been remarked in this Court that good character is not an unusual characteristic of persons involved in drug importations. This particularly so with couriers or persons collecting drugs. It has also been stated many times that less weight can, therefore, be given to such a factor in light of the seriousness of being involved in the importation of a significant quantity of drugs at any level. 
     
      
    48 I propose that the appeal against conviction be dismissed. Leave to appeal against sentence should be granted but the appeal dismissed. 
     
      
    49 HALL J: I agree with Howie J.

    JUDGMENT1. Omar Kaddour was arraigned before a jury at Campbelltown on 20 February 2007 charged with two drug offences. They were both offences of supplying a prohibited drug contrary to s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. They were both cases of deemed supply in that the offender had in his possession amounts of each drug that were not less than the trafficable quantity. Hence he was deemed to have the drug in his possession for supply in accordance with s 29 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act because he failed to satisfy the jury by which he was tried that he had it in his possession otherwise than for supply.2. The drug in the first count of the indictment was 3,4methylenedioxymethylamphetamine and the drug which was the subject of the second count was methylamphetamine. Each of the offences carries a maximum penalty of fifteen years imprisonment in accordance with s 32(1)(g) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act. 3. I turn now to the objective facts of the offences. Drawing upon the evidence called before the jury I find the following as objective facts and they are proved to my satisfaction beyond reasonable doubt and in my opinion are consistent with the jury verdicts.4. At about 5.45pm on Tuesday 10 August 2006 the offender was seen by police driving a car along Hume Highway at Yagoona. There was another man who was his passenger. His driving alerted the attention of the police who stopped him. He appeared very nervous and the two men behaved in a way which the police regarded as suspicious. The offender denied having anything illegal in his possession but the other man admitted to having some “pills on me”. At the same time a sunglasses cases fell from the bottom of the other man’s pants onto the ground. It contained a number of resealable plastic bags of tablets. The other man was arrested. He told the police that they Ecstasy tablets but denied that they were his.5. At that point Mr Kaddour, who was sitting on a fence nearby waiting for his turn, approached the police and claimed the tablets as his, telling the police that he had asked the other man to take them out of the glove box and put them down his pants when the police stopped him. The offender Mr Kaddour was then arrested.6. Mr Kaddour was taken to the Bankstown police station. The tablets were weighed and counted. There were fifty-six tablets in all. Thirty-two of them were lime coloured with a Euro Dollar emblem. Two of those tablets were loose, the other thirty were contained in six separate resealable bags, five tablets being in each bag. In addition there were twenty-four brown coloured tablets with a musical logo on them.7. Mr Kaddour was interviewed at the police station and the interview was recorded. I saw the tape played before the jury and a transcript was also made available. During that interview, which occurred on 10 August 2006 at 7.15pm, Mr Kaddour gave an account that he had bought the pills “from this guy” about three or four months previously. The transaction occurred at MacDonald’s Auburn and he had paid $500-$600 for the pills. The number he purchased was “whatever there was there” that he had been caught with. The reason for the two different colours was that he wanted “Euro Dollar” ones, but the vendor did not have enough of those “so he gave me those brown ones”. He admitted taking two or three of the white tablets but denied selling or giving away any of the tablets. He was questioned about why he had them in the car and claimed that he was going to dispose of them in some big rubbish bins near the gym that he was going to attend. He did not want to dispose of them at home in case his parents discovered them and “never thought” of disposing of them in a rubbish bin in a park near his home. He had $410 in cash in his possession when he was stopped and explained that it was payday at work and he had withdrawn that amount from an ATM that morning. He denied that the cash was proceeds from the sale of any drugs.8. Senior Constable Mitchell, one of the arresting officers, gave evidence before the jury. In cross-examination he agreed that he had found no evidence of actual supply, such as large amounts of cash or any diary of drug sales or scales. He agreed that the offender had no previous criminal history. 9. Detective Inspector Adney also gave evidence. He has a good deal of experience in drug investigation. He told the jury that the analyst had reported to him that the twenty-four brown coloured tablets weighed a total of 6 grams and that the thirty-two lime coloured tablets weighed a total of 7.74 grams. He reported that the brown tablets were a mixture of 3,4methylenedioxymethyl-amphetamine, known as MDMA, and N-methyl3,4methylenedioxy-methylamphetamine known as MDMA. Such tablets are also known as “Ecstasy”. He also reported that the lime coloured tablets were methylamphetamine, also known as “speed”. Both types of illegal drugs are most commonly sold by tablets rather than weight. He said that the tablets are most commonly sold in plastic resealable bags. He thought the brown tablets with the musical note symbol would have a street value, if sold individually, of approximately forty dollars. Hence the value of all the brown tablets on that basis was some $960. The lime tablets with the Euro dollar sign would have a street value of about thirty dollars if sold individually, hence the total value of those would also be in the region of $960. 10. Inspector Adney was cross-examined and acknowledged that the street value can vary greatly depending on the number, the purity, and whether there was an ongoing relationship between the parties. Not surprisingly it was not uncommon that vendors of illegal drugs would be unscrupulous. He acknowledged that there can be bad batches or impurities from the manufacturing process.11. I now turn to the offender's account. Mr Kaddour gave evidence before the jury. By way of background he said that he had finished his trade and was now doing an advanced course in plumbing. He lived at home with his parents and his brother and sister. His parents had been born in Lebanon. He said that he and his brother assist his parents in paying the mortgage on their home. His own contribution was in the region of $200 per week. That partly explained the amount of money he had withdrawn on the day of the offence. 12. He had come across illegal tablets whilst clubbing with his friends. His first couple of experiences were stimulating and enjoyable. He realised that he could get a cheaper price for buying them in bulk so he purchased five tablets for $125 one night. A man known only as “Shack” gave him his phone number and said he could supply more. He made an arrangement to meet him at McDonald’s in Auburn. He said he only wanted to buy thirty, which would have cost $450, but the man offered him sixty for $600 and he accepted that offer. The packaging from the dealer was the same as the packaging when he was arrested. He hid them at home because he knew that his parents would disapprove of them. He bought them in bulk to use when he went clubbing and so that he would not be forced to pay more when buying smaller amounts. However when he took some of the tablets he had bought his experience was quite different and he felt nauseous and very uncomfortable. That experience prompted him to get rid of the pills and, as he said in the recorded interview, he decided to dispose of them at the disposal unit near the gym. He said he would never use them again and had learnt his lesson.13. In cross-examination he said that had decided to get rid of the tablets about three months before he was arrested. He never mentioned to the police during his recorded interview his bad experience with the pills because he was not asked. It did not occur to him that he could have got rid of them driving to work on any day. He thought putting them into a neighbour’s bin might have been “a bit cruel”.14. I turn now to the convictions and the evidence on sentence. Mr Kaddour was found guilty of both counts on 23 February 2007. I convicted him and stood the sentence proceedings over to 20 April 2007. On that day the crown prosecutor tendered a pre-sentence report dated 18 April 2007 then closed his case on sentence. Defence counsel called his client, his client’s mother and his client’s sister. He also tendered statements by his client and his client’s mother, as well as material from his client’s employer, from TAFE, from a bank concerning loans, from his high school, the Board of Studies, as well as his client’s CV.15. Mr Kaddour in his statement which he verified from the witness box recorded that he was truly sorry for becoming involved with drugs and would never do it again. He has continued his employment and works five or six days a week in a secure position. He is still engaged in his advanced plumbing certificate course and hopes to proceed to an unrestricted plumber’s certificate. He still lives at home with his parents and his brother and sister. He still contributes to the mortgage as well as paying off loans which he took out to meet his legal fees. He has changed his friendships to exclude those who engage in drug use and avoids venues where that may occur. 16. Mrs Mona Kaddour recorded in her statement that she and her husband were extremely shocked at their son’s arrest and noted how much anxiety and concern it had caused within the family. He had been a good son and achieved well at school and in employment, and had contributed in purchasing the family home. She also recorded that the offender had communicated his extreme embarrassment and sorrow to his parents about what had occurred and promised that it would never occur again.17. Mr Kaddour’s sister, Zena Kaddour, is aged seventeen and is in year twelve. She has always lived at home. She has a close relationship with her brother, the offender. She had noticed up until his arrest that he had not been as caring and tended to be rude and immature as well as being not very respectful towards his parents. Since his arrest he his behaviour has changed. He had become more responsible and respectful and communicated more. He appeared more mature. She said he was more like a man now whereas before he had been more like a little boy. She confirmed that he had changed his social activities and had become more aware of right and wrong. He had become quieter since the trial and she thought that he was a little scared. His father had given him a big lecture. The offender took the lecture and did not shout back because he appeared to realise his mistake. The offender has recounted to his sister how he regrets what he did and has acknowledged how it has caused a lot of problems within the family. Ms Kaddour acknowledged that Mr Kaddour contributed some money to the mortgage and did not know what would happen if he stopped. She said the money from the offender was a big help. In cross-examination she said that she did not know how much was paid off the mortgage every month.18. The Pre-Sentence Report was dated 18 April 2007. It recorded that Mr Kaddour was born on 22 April 1985 so that he has just recently turned twenty-two. It recorded no mental health, gambling, or other issues, and noted his claim that he had been abstinent from drugs since May 2006. It also recorded Mr Kaddour’s embarrassment at his actions and that he had described his actions as “stupid”, not realising how serious they were. He maintained his denial of selling or suppling Ecstasy to other people. The report noted his suitability for a low level of intervention from the Probation and Parole Service but thought it unlikely because there were no particular presenting issues. It assessed him as suitable for a Community Service Order although noting that there were no presenting issues that could be addressed through participation in a developmental program. It noted he was eligible for periodic detention. 19. His employer noted that the offender was an honest reliable and hard working employee who had been engaged since 10 May 2003 as an apprentice plumber. The TAFE documents noted that he would become eligible to apply for his plumber’s licence in 2008 and the bank documents recorded a loan of some $22,000. In 2002 he had been regarded by his school principal in year 12 adviser as an honest and trustworthy person.20. I turn now to the submissions which were put by the parties. In his submissions Mr Howen put to the forefront of his argument that I should consider something other than a full-time custodial sentence. The options were, a suspended sentence, periodic detention, or a Community Service Order. His primary submission was for a suspended sentence. 21. Canvassing the objective features he argued that there was no evidence of actual or commercial supply. He argued that there was no evidence that the offender had packaged the drugs, but they were in the same packaging as when he received them. There was no forensic evidence that the offender had handled the bags inside the glasses case. He argued that I should find that there was no actual supply only a deemed supply. He said that I could make a positive finding that no drug activity was intended by the offender. He said the objective facts of the offence were at the low end of the range. He argued that so far as the methylenedioxymethylamphetamine drugs were concerned the 6 grams was right at the very bottom of the indictable range so that it was not a significant quantity. He made the same submission in respect of the methylamphetamine weighing 7.74 grams. He asked me to make findings accepting the offender's account of the circumstances of the purchase of the drugs.22. Turning to his client’s subjective features, he pointed to his client’s good character and hard working family, including his own financial contribution to the family home. He highlighted no drug or alcohol dependency problems and the difference observed by his sister after his arrest and after his trial. He invited me to find actual remorse, arguing that I was not bound in that respect by the jury verdict regarding actual supply. The remorse extended beyond being sorry because he was caught, to regret at implicating his family. He pointed to a small likelihood of re-offending given the change in his behaviour and social contacts. He highlighted how the family had everything to lose if the offender went to gaol full time or if he re-offended. He argued that the offender's rehabilitation had already happened, pointing to his change in habits. He argued that although his client had not pleaded guilty he did not deny the possession but at the earliest possible opportunity owned up to the fact that the drugs were his. He said that there were no aggravating factors under s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. In fact he said it was not so much an organised crime as a disorganised crime.23. Turning to the authorities and to the statistics Mr Howen pointed to the high percentage of offenders involved in supplying amphetamines and Ecstasy who did not receive full time custody. He commented that suspended sentences were common.24. Mr Williams for the Crown submitted that these offences do require a sentence of full time custody. Although conceding that there was no evidence of actual supply he submitted that it was not consistent with the jury verdict for me to find that there was no intention or capacity to supply. The verdict reflected the statutory purpose of possession “for the purpose of supply”. He said that there was no evidence of any supply to friends or relatives, so, he submitted, the only inference left was an intention to supply for remuneration. He was not himself an addict so he said there was simply no other alternatives.25. Mr Williams said it was clear the jury did not accept the offender's evidence on the balance of probabilities. That, he said, should affect the rest of his evidence which I should regard with great scepticism.26. Mr Williams said the offences involved trafficking to a substantial degree. The trafficable amount for one of the drugs was .7 grams so that there was involved trafficking an amount of eight times the trafficable amount. For the other drug, the multiple was two and a half times the trafficable amount.27. Mr Williams submitted that it was not a bottom of the range offence. The offender had been convicted of two offences involving two separate drugs. The financial value of the drugs could vary. For one of the drugs it could be $1300, for the other it could be $2500. He said the packaging of the drugs assisted the finding of trafficking and the absence of drug paraphernalia was not relevant because they were sold as pills and the paraphernalia was not needed. It beggared belief that he was arrested by coincidence on the same day that he was conveying them for disposal.28. On the question of remorse Mr Williams pointed out that there had been no plea of guilty. The offender had never conceded that the drugs were “for supply”, which is the essence of the crime. Hence there is no real remorse in respect of the offences of which he was convicted. So far as hardship to third parties was concerned, he said that this was not established to any significant degree and did not meet the requirement of the authorities that it should be exceptional. In any event the evidence did not take the question of hardship very far. The offender's sister’s evidence was limited and there was no evidence that the parents would lose their home. Mr Williams frankly acknowledged that the subjective case was strong to some extent but not so much as to ameliorate the principle in the authorities about a drug trafficker to a substantial degree needing to go to prison. He also acknowledged that there were special circumstances, it would be the offender's first time in custody, warranting a longer than usual period for parole. Mr Williams pointed out that the offender had already spent ten full days in custody from the date of his arrest on 10 August 2006 until 20 August 2006.29. In reply Mr Howen said that it was not relevant for a Crown Prosecutor to base a submission on the trafficable amount because it was the indictable amount which was relevant to a District Court sentence. In addition, whilst acknowledging that the drug was sold in the form of pills, the law quantified them by weight. Addressing the question of whether his client had possession of the drugs for sale he said the extended definition of supply does not have at its core commerciality. It was the process of supply rather than whether or not it was for remuneration that was proscribed. He said there was no evidence of any commercial aspect in this case. Mr Howen emphasised that his client’s remorse was reflected in his change of lifestyle and habits, and was in respect of the consequences of his crimes. He acknowledged his ownership of the drugs from the first moment and was entitled to have the jury test his case, but that did not mean that he had lost the opportunity to plead remorse in the way that he had. As to hardship it was obvious that the parents could not get the house loan without their son’s help.30. As to special circumstances he adopted the Crown’s point about the first time in custody and also pointed to his client’s youth. If I was compelled to impose a full time custodial sentence Mr Howen submitted that the statutory ratio between the non parole period and the parole period could be dramatically changed in this case, it could even be in the region of one third to two thirds. The non parole period itself could be quite short because the overall sentence should not, he submitted, be very high. Another factor affecting the ratio was his financial role in his family so that a short non parole period would reduce significantly the financial impact on the family.31. I turn now to consider the sentence which I should impose. I begin by making some findings, or expressing some opinions about the submissions that were made. It was common ground that there was no evidence of actual or commercial supply. In respect of the submission that I could make a positive finding that no drug activity was intended by the offender, I do not accept that submission. It runs contrary to the authorities. One of those authorities is Regina v Simpson [2006] NSWCCA 117. At [15] of his judgment Hislop J, with whom the Chief Judge at Common Law and Sully J agreed, said as follows: 
     
      
       
      “ 
      As the applicant had pleaded guilty to a deemed supply of prohibited drugs it was not open to his Honour to deal with the matter on any basis other than that the applicant had the drugs in his possession for the purpose of supply. In this context it was observed by his Honour that the offences to which the applicant had pleaded guilty impact upon the very people in the community that the applicant had done so much to help in the past 
      .” 
       
      
     
     
     Also in  
     Regina v Pilley (1991) 56 ACrimR 202 
     , Finlay J, with whom Handley JA and Allen J agreed, made similar remarks about a case of deemed supply. 
      
    32. So far as accepting the offender's account is concerned, I do regard his account and his evidence with some degree of scepticism. I accept his account of the circumstances of the purchase but I do not accept it so far as he claims that it was for his own use, that is inconsistent with the verdict of the jury. I too regard as beyond acceptable belief the claim that by coincidence he was about to dispose of the drugs when he was arrested by the police. Another basis for some degree of scepticism is the fact that the jury rejected his evidence and his claim that the drugs were for his own use. 33. I do find, however, evidence of actual remorse. I accept Mr Williams’ submission that the remorse is limited by the fact that he claimed that the drugs were in his possession for his own use. However I accept that he owned up to possession of the drugs at the earliest opportunity and I accept the evidence of his sister in particular, who gave evidence before me, and the account of his mother regarding his changed behaviour. And I accept Mr Howen’s submission that his remorse is consistent with a change of attitude and behaviour so far as the consequences of his offending behaviour are concerned.34. I do not accept the submission made by Mr Howen concerning the hardship that would be occasioned to the offender's family if he were to be incarcerated full time. The level of hardship brought about to third parties by an offender's behaviour has to be truly exceptional. The authorities are reviewed in Regina v Nguyen (2006) 166 ACrimR 124. Despite what would appear to be some qualification to the general principle about exceptional circumstances contained in that case I am not satisfied that the degree of hardship which would be brought about by depriving the family of Mr Kaddour’s income is so exceptional that it should impact on any decision which I should make. That is because, as the authorities say, sadly such impacts normally accompany such offending behaviour.35. I do accept that he has good prospects of rehabilitation. Once again his sister’s evidence was convincing. It appears that he has changed his habits of behaviour and the circle in which he mixes. He has, and has kept, a good job. He is near to attaining a final qualification for which he has been studying for some years. He clearly comes from a solid, loving and supportive family, and he is still living with that family. It seems to me, and I have formed the view, that his prospects of rehabilitation given those circumstances are very good.36. As to evidence of the deemed and intended supply being for commercial purposes, that question is finely balanced. On the one hand I can see the force of the Crown’s submission that there was no evidence of any supply to friends or relatives, so that the only inference left was an intention to supply for remuneration. On the other hand Mr Howen has pointed out that there was no evidence of any commercial aspect in this case. I think in those circumstances, luckily for Mr Kaddour, I conclude that I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the intended supply was for commercial purposes. I would be satisfied on the balance of probabilities and I see great strength in the Crown’s submission but this is a significant finding to make and I am reluctant to make it as a finding beyond reasonable doubt when essentially the Crown’s argument, as good as it is, is based upon an inference as being the only inference which I can draw. Clearly another but unlikely inference is that he had the drugs for the purpose of giving them away to his friends, or sharing them at social events. Nevertheless there was a significant number of pills, being fifty-six in all, and I regard the number of pills in the offender's possession as significant.37. I do accept the submission of Mr Howen, not opposed by the Crown, to the effect that there are special circumstances which would warrant the adjustment of the normal ratio between the non parole period and the parole period. Those special circumstances are that this would be the first time which Mr Kaddour has served in custody and he is a very young man. Another reason for adjusting that ratio is that an extended period of parole, supervised to some limited extent, whereby the offender would have an opportunity to, ideally, remain at home and continue with his rehabilitation would be in my opinion, desirable in this case.38. I now turn to the authorities on the question of imprisonment. The main sentencing principle which is relevant to this sentencing exercise is that the penalty should be full time custody unless there are exceptional circumstances: the authorities are very clear about that. One of them is Regina v Gu [2006] NSWCCA 104. In that case Howie J said at [27]: 
     
      
       
      “ 
      There has been a consistent line of authority in this Court that has made it quite clear that, unless there are truly exceptional circumstances present, a full-time custodial sentence ought to be imposed wherever the offender has been substantially involved in the supply of prohibited drugs 
      ” 
       
      
     That principle has been emphasised time and again in the Court of Criminal Appeal.39. This is a case which forms an exception to the principle which has been enunciated. The reasons that I reach that conclusion are that it is not a case which involves supply for commercial purposes. I appreciate that the authorities do not provide that that must be present in every case and that to anyone substantially involved in the supply of prohibited drugs the principle applies. I think in this case Mr Kaddour has been on the border of substantial involvement in the supply of prohibited drugs. He is close to that border but I do not regard him as being over it. Another reason for this case being an exception to the principle is authority to the effect that where there is evidence that full time custody will nullify the rehabilitation previously achieved, there is a public interest in not interfering in a process of demonstrated rehabilitation. I refer to Regina v Ramos (2000) 112 ACrimR 339. Those remarks were made by the Chief Judge at Common Law at 342 ([14]).40. One of the main reasons for me concluding that this case should not be dealt with by a period of full time custody is that it seems clear to me from the evidence of the family that Mr Kaddour has embarked upon a road towards his rehabilitation. His sister has noticed a change in his behaviour. He is still at home. He is still employed, and he is at a home which provides a strong and supportive but strict environment. Were I to sentence Mr Kaddour to a period of full time custody it would, in my opinion, deprive him of his employment and put him into an environment where it is likely that his rehabilitation would be derailed.41. However on the other hand I regard this as sufficiently serious a case, and close enough to cases which fall in the general principle, as to warrant a custodial sentence in the form of a periodic detention order and I have decided that I am going to sentence Mr Kaddour to a period of periodic detention. I have reached that conclusion because it means that his rehabilitation can progress at home and by virtue of his employment, but he will be punished by being deprived of his liberty at the weekend.42. I have determined that an appropriate sentence for Mr Kaddour is three years. I find on the basis of the submissions which I have accepted that there are special circumstances in this case warranting an alteration of the ratio between the non parole period and the parole period and I propose to alter that ratio to one of 50/50 instead of the standard ratio of 75/25.43. In determining that periodic detention order is appropriate I have received a report which I have already referred to from the Probation and Parole Service, a pre-sentence report, and that contains an assertion that Mr Kaddour is eligible and has been assessed as suitable for a periodic detention order and that he has signed an appropriate undertaking to that effect. I have taken into account the contents of that report. It is my understanding that accommodation is available at a periodic detention centre and I am satisfied of that. Mr Howen one of the things I have to be satisfied of is that there are transport arrangements available, can I assume that Mr Kaddour will be able to get himself there and back or that somebody will be able to give him a lift?HOWEN: Does your Honour know which periodic detention centre is likely to be used?HIS HONOUR: Yes, I think I do, Parramatta.HOWEN: I’ll just get some instructions. I'm instructed your Honour Mr Kaddour still has a car. I can’t think of any legal reason why he can’t drive to the periodic detention centre.HIS HONOUR: No, it’s in his interests that he has transport there and back.HOWEN: Absolutely, I'm instructed he still has his vehicle. I've never checked but there must be parking within and around the prison. But he has personal transport independent of public transport and instructs me that also there’s family, but it doesn’t look like he’ll need to rely upon that.HIS HONOUR: Good, that’s all I need to hear Mr Howen, that's fine.44. I am satisfied of the following matters in accordance with s 66 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. The offender is above the age of eighteen and is a suitable person to serve his sentence by way of periodic detention. I am satisfied that it is appropriate in all of the circumstances that the sentence be served by way of periodic detention for the reasons which I have given earlier. I am satisfied that there is accommodation available at the periodic detention centre at Parramatta for him to serve his sentence by way of periodic detention and I am satisfied that transport arrangements are available for travel by Mr Kaddour to and from the periodic detention centre for the purpose of serving his sentence being arrangements that will not impose undue inconvenience strain or hardship on him. I am satisfied that Mr Kaddour has signed an undertaking to comply with the offender's obligation under the periodic detention order. I have had regard to the contents of the assessment report as well, being the Probation and Parole Service report.45. Mr Kaddour I am going to sentence you to imprisonment for three years. I set a non parole period of eighteen months and I set a balance of the term of your sentence of eighteen months as well. The three year sentence is to commence Saturday of next week, 9 June 2007, and expire on 8 June 2010. The non parole period is to commence on 9 June 2007 and expire on 8 December 2008. I make a periodic detention order directing that the sentence which I have imposed upon you be served by way of periodic detention. The date of commencement of that sentence being 9 June 2007.46. Mr Kaddour the periodic detention centre in which you will serve your sentence is at Parramatta at 1 O’Connell Street Parramatta. The first occasion on which you must attend is Saturday 9 June 2007 and you are to report at the periodic detention centre at Parramatta on that Saturday at 8.30am. On each occasion after that you are to report at the same place at 7pm on each Friday evening and you will be released at 4pm each Sunday evening. Might I ask for your help Mr Howen. One of the things I have to explain to Mr Kaddour, and this is what I'm trying to find, is the consequences that may follow if he fails to comply. That’s s 71 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and Ms Fleming if you can help as well. I'm just trying to find the statutory provision which sets out those consequences so that I can explain them to Mr Kaddour.HOWEN: There’s nothing in the commentary of the loose leaf Practice either, unless it’s in the regulations. Your Honour the regulations are silent. In the section that deals with periodic detention sentencing, the closest reference is periodic detention orders under s 72 and warrants at 73. I think I've failed this quiz. I can’t remember where it is. Your Honour having regard to the section, may I submit that a plain English explanation under s 71 would not be an appealable error. HIS HONOUR: Yes, I'm sure you're right.HOWEN: A court must ensure that all reasonable steps are taken to explain to the offender in language he can readily understand obligations, well that’s basically, turn up when I told you to and if you don’t turn up you'll be back before me. The other aspect is your Honour, there is a procedure, an administration procedure the Corrective Services operate in the case of genuine illness. If they accept the medical certificate it’s considered as a proper excuse and a warrant doesn’t issue. And it’s not a proper excuse - a warrant doesn’t necessarily issue, they tack on the extra time at the end so you don’t get off the weekend you don’t go. But after a certain number of failures to attend they can invoke a breach provision. That's my understanding of the administration of it. Mr Kaddour instructs me that the Probation and Parole Officer has spoken to him of the consequences of non-compliance but I do not know what the officer said to him. So I submit that your Honour could safely, in plain English, follow s 71.HIS HONOUR: I've found it, my associate’s pointed it out. It is in the Crimes Administration Sentences Act 1999 and what you say is also right. One thing I need to do is give a direction about the non parole period. 47. I make an order directing the release of Mr Kaddour on parole at the end of the non parole period.48. Mr Kaddour you have heard what Mr Howen said, which is right. You have to comply with any requirements, any directions given to you by the officers at the corrective service place where you are going. Any change in your residential address, you have to inform the management at the periodic detention centre. You have to allow a correctional centre officer to visit you at your home if they want to, and you have to comply with the regulations and the Act so far as they tell you that you have to comply. The periodic detention order will expire when you are released to parole, which is at the end of the eighteen months. You have to report to the periodic detention centre at the beginning of each period. You have to participate in any activity or work which you are directed to do. You can apply to have the times of your detention varied. You can be granted leave of absence for health, compassionate grounds. This is important. The sentence which you are serving if you fail to report for one or more of your detention periods, whether or not leave of absence is granted, the sentence is extended by one week for each detention period for which you fail to report. So every time you do not turn up, either with or without leave of absence by the looks of it, it is extended. So it is in your interests to go to as many as you can, in fact all of them if possible, and if you turn up late it can be extended for one week as well. You can make applications for leave of absence and things like that.Is it the case Mr Howen that if there’s any significant or serious breach that he can be re-sentenced? I doubt it.HOWEN: I think it converts to full time is my recollection - if he’s breached and a warrant is issued. My recollection is your Honour converts to full time and I also recall the Parole Board have a role in that system as well because they can - if you are put in full time the Parol Board can review that and you can actually have the periodic detention reinstated. I’ve had a matter like that, I've had a client who actually had his periodic detention reinstated after significant breaches.49. Mr Kaddour, if you misbehave, fail to attend, these details can be explained to you. If it suspects you have failed to comply with your obligations, the parole authority may conduct an inquiry and it may revoke the periodic detention order and you may be taken into full time custody. I am sorry to be so laborious there but it is important that I explain these things to you.50. If the drugs have not been destroyed I make an order for the destruction of the prohibited drugs, I make that order under s 39P of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act.51. Mr Kaddour you have heard what I said, I just want to say this to you. You are a young man, you have done a very very silly thing. You have been very lucky in the findings that I made. As I said I think you probably had them to sell but I was not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that you had them to sell and I have decided that the best way of dealing with your case is by sending you to weekend gaol. I am doing that because you obviously come from a good strong family and the evidence suggests that you are getting back on to the right track. My advice to you as a judge and as a father is to stay in your family for the time being and to stay on the path of rehabilitation which you have started, and do not think of doing anything similar to what you have done before. Because you came very very close to going to gaol full time and that would be very hazardous for you and would really set you, I think, on the wrong path, which is why I have decided to make an exception in your case. Do you understand what I have said?OFFENDER: Yes your Honour.

     JUDGMENT 
     
     
      
    1 THE COURT: At the conclusion of the expedited hearing, on 3 May, the Court made a brief statement of reasons and pronounced the following orders: 
     
      
       
      1. Grant leave to appeal. 
       
       
      2. Direct appellant to file and serve notice of appeal within 3 days. 
       
       
      3. Appeal upheld. 
       
       
      4. Set aside the order made in para 61(1) of the judgment of Hoeben J dated 17 April 2007. 
       
       
      5. In lieu, order pursuant to s16(1) of the  
      Crimes (Serious Sex Offenders) Act 2006, 
       that the respondent be detained at a correctional centre on an interim basis for a period of 28 days from today. 
       
       
      6. Order pursuant to s20(1) of the Act that a warrant issue for the committal of the respondent to a correctional centre for the period specified in order 5. 
       
       
      7. No order as to costs. 
       
      8. Direct that these orders be entered forthwith and an appropriate warrant issued. 
       
      
    2 We now provide a fuller statement of our reasons. 
     
      
       
      Overview of the Act 
       
      
    3 The Crimes (Serious Sex Offenders) Act 2006 states (s3) that its objects are: 
     
      
       
        
        to provide for the extended supervision and continuing detention of serious sex offenders so as: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) to ensure the safety and protection of the community, and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) to facilitate the rehabilitation of serious sex offenders. 
          
         
        
       
      
    4 The Act empowers the Supreme Court, on the application of the Attorney General, to make a range of orders having the effect of extending the period of control over serious sex offenders beyond the term of a sentence of imprisonment imposed in consequence of conviction for sex offences. 
     
      
    5 The stated objects reveal that the legislation is protective rather than punitive in its intent. Proceedings under it are civil proceedings that must be brought in the Supreme Court. However, when considering whether or not certain final orders should be made, the Court is required to be “satisfied to a high degree of probability” of certain pre-conditions (see ss9(2), 17(2)-(3)). There are also procedural thresholds relating to court-ordered psychiatric examinations of the offender (ss7(4), 15(4)). 
     
      
    6 Part 2 of the Act (ss6-13) deals with extended supervision orders and interim supervision orders. Part 3 (ss14-20) deals with continuing detention orders and interim detention orders.  
     
      
    7 Detention orders have the effect of committing the offender to a correctional centre or extending his or her detention beyond the current custody arrangements.  
     
      
    8 Supervision orders effectively permit the offender to be released upon the expiry of his or her current custody or supervision, subject to a range of conditions determined by the Court as appropriate for the “adequate supervision” (s17(3)) of the offender. The failure to comply with the requirements of a supervision order is an offence with a maximum penalty of 100 penalty units or imprisonment for two years, or both (s12). 
     
      
       
       “Final” orders 
       
      
    9 The Act authorises the Attorney General to apply for two types of final orders: an “extended supervision order” (s6) and a “continuing detention order” (s14). (The expression “final” does not appear in the Act, although other types of orders are labelled “interim” (see below).) Each type of final order may be varied or revoked on the application of the Attorney General or the offender (ss13, 19).  
     
      
    10 The distinction between a supervision order and a detention order is of some importance. A supervision order, as the name implies, involves no detention but permits a variety of conditions “as the Supreme Court considers appropriate”, but including those specified in s11. Those conditions can impose constraint as well as positive obligations. Most from their subject matter, appear directed to the capacity to supervise such a person. However they can extend to ordering mandatory participation in treatment and rehabilitation programs. A detention order, as the name implies imposes continued custodial detention. A continuing detention order, moreover, “may be made if and only if the Supreme Court is satisfied to a high degree of probability that the offender is likely to commit a further serious sex offence if he or she is not kept under supervision and that adequate supervision will not be provided by an extended supervision order.” In determining whether or not to make a continuing detention order or extended supervision order the Supreme Court must have regard to the matters specified in s17(4) “in addition to any other matter it considers relevant”. Generally speaking, those matters go to “the safety of the community”, and include a number of specific matters, bearing both on the above and on “the likelihood that the offender will in future commit offences of a sexual nature”.  
     
      
    11 Applications for the two categories of order may only be made with respect to a “sex offender”, a term defined in s4 to mean a person who has at any time been sentenced to imprisonment following his or her conviction of a serious sex offence, other than an offence committed while the person was a child. “Serious sex offence” is itself defined in s5. 
     
      
    12 For an extended supervision order, s6(1) requires the application to be made at a time when the offender is in custody or under supervision: 
     
      
       
        
        (a) while serving a sentence of imprisonment: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (i) for a serious sex offence, or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (ii) for an offence of sexual nature, 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        whether the sentence is being served by way of full-time, periodic or home detention and whether the offender is in custody or on release on parole, or 
        
       
       
        
        (b) pursuant to an existing extended supervision order or continuing detention order, 
        
       
       
        
        referred to in this Part as his or her  
        current custody or supervision. 
        
       
       
        
         
          
         
        
       
      
    13 For a continuing detention order, the application must be made at a time when the offender is in custody in a correctional centre (s14(1)): 
     
      
       
        
        (a) while serving a sentence of imprisonment: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (i) for a serious sex offence, or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (ii) for an offence of a sexual nature, or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (b) pursuant to an existing continuing detention order, 
        
       
       
        
        referred to in this Part as his or her  
        current custody 
        . 
        
       
      
    14 The application may not be made “until the last 6 months of the offender’s current custody or supervision,” in the case of an extended supervision order (see 6(2)); or “until the last 6 months of the offender’s current custody”, in the case of a continuing detention order (see s14(2)). In each instance, the application must be supported by documentation that addresses various matters and that includes an expert report that assesses the likelihood of the offender committing a further serious sex offence (ss6(3), 14(3)). 
     
      
    15 An application for a continuing detention order may be determined by making such an order, by making an extended supervision order or by dismissing the application (s17(1)). 
     
      
    16 For each category of final order, the Act provides pre-trial procedures (ss7, 15). These include conducting a preliminary hearing that requires the Court to consider whether the matters alleged in the supporting documentation would justify the making of a final order. If it would, psychiatric examinations must be arranged. If it would not, the substantive application must be dismissed (ss7(4), (5), 15(4), (5)). 
     
      
    17 Five years is the maximum permitted for either category of final order, with time running from the date the order is made, or when the offender’s current custody expires, whichever is the later. The Act allows the Court to specify a lesser period and the Attorney General to seek a second or subsequent order against the same offender (ss10, 18).18 The standard of proof is high for the making of final orders. Section 17(2) and (3) (see also s9(2) that duplicates s17(2)) provides: 
     
      
       
        
        (2) An extended supervision order may be made if and only if the Supreme Court is satisfied to a high degree of probability that the offender is likely to commit a further serious sex offence if he or she is not kept under supervision. 
        
       
       
        
        (3) A continuing detention order may be made if and only if the Supreme Court is satisfied to a high degree of probability that the offender is likely to commit a further serious sex offence if he or she is not kept under supervision and that adequate supervision will not be provided by an extended supervision order. 
        
       
       
      Interim orders 
       
      
    19 The Act also authorises the making of interim orders. 
     
      
    20 Interim supervision orders are addressed in s8, which provides: 
     
      
       
        
        (1) If, in proceedings on an application for an extended supervision order, it appears to the Supreme Court: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) that the offender’s current custody or supervision will expire before the proceedings are determined, and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) that the matters alleged in the supporting documentation would, if proved, justify the making of an extended supervision order, 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          the Supreme Court may make an order for the interim supervision of the offender. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (2) An order under this section commences on the day fixed in the order in that regard (or, if no such day is fixed, as soon as it is made) and expires at the end of such period (not exceeding 28 days from the day on which it commences) as is specified in the order. 
        
       
       
        
        (3) An order under this section may be renewed from time to time, but not so as to provide for the supervision of the offender under such an order for periods totalling more than 3 months. 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    21 Conditions may be imposed on an interim supervision order (s11) and it is a criminal offence to fail to comply with them (s12). 
     
      
    22 Interim detention orders are addressed in s16, which provides: 
     
      
       
        
        (1) If, in proceedings on an application for a continuing detention order, it appears to the Supreme Court: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) that the offender’s current custody will expire before the proceedings are determined, and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) that the matters alleged in the supporting documentation would, if proved, justify the making of a continuing detention order or extended supervision order, 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          the Supreme Court may make an order for the interim detention of the offender. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (2) An order under this section commences on the day fixed in the order in that regard (or, if no such day is fixed, as soon as it is made) and expires at the end of such period (not exceeding 28 days from the day on which it commences) as is specified in the order. 
        
       
       
        
        (3) An order under this section may be renewed from time to time, but not so as to provide for the detention of the offender under such an order for periods totalling more than 3 months. 
        
       
       
        
         
          
         
        
       
      
    23 Each category of interim order may be varied or revoked on the application of the Attorney General or the offender (ss13, 19). 
     
      
       
       
      The scope of ss8 and 16: powers in the nature of duties or discretionary powers? 
       
      
    24 By placing ss8(1) and 16(1) side by side, it can be seen that the power in s8(1) is enlivened if the proceedings include a claim for an extended supervision order and that the power in s16(1) is enlivened if the proceedings include a claim for a continuing detention order. Since each form of final relief was sought in the present case, it was open to the Court to grant either form of interim relief if the circumstances permitted it, as they were found to do. 
     
      
    25 For each provision, the power to make the respective interim order is enlivened if it “appears” to the Court that the conditions in (a) and (b) are satisfied.  
     
      
    26 There was never a question about condition (a) in the instant case. 
     
      
    27 The terms of condition (b) make it plain that the Court’s function under the respective provisions is to examine the “supporting documentation” (as to which see ss6(3) and 14(3)) to determine what is “alleged” in that documentation; and to decide whether it “would, if proved, justify” the making of the stipulated final order.  
     
      
    28 As regards interim supervision orders, it need only appear that the matters alleged would justify the making of an extended supervision order (s8(1)(b)).  
     
      
    29 As regards interim detention orders, the power is enlivened if the matters would justify the making of either type of final order (s16(1)(b)). The word “or” in s16(1)(b) indicates that an interim detention order is capable of being made even if the matters alleged would only justify the making of an extended supervision order, so long as the substantive proceedings contain a claim for a continuing detention order. See also s17(1). 
     
      
    30 There was debate before us as to whether the subsections contain a power in the nature of a duty or a discretionary power. It had been common ground below that a true discretion was involved, and Hoeben J accepted this proposition (J15). (See also Attorney-General v Gallagher [2006] NSWSC 340 at [36] (McClellan CJ at CL)). This also was the initial position of the appellant on appeal although, responding to questions from the Bench, the appellant advanced some arguments in favour of construing the “may” as a “must”. 
     
      
    31 The principles indicating the interpretation of the word “may” in such circumstances have recently been expounded by the High Court (Leach v R (2007) 232 ALR 325, [2007] HCA 3). 
     
      
    32 In our view, the powers under the respective provisions entail a discretion, enabling the Court to refuse to make an order in a proper case even if conditions (a) and (b) are satisfied. It is sufficient to explain why this is so in the context of s16(1), the presently relevant provision. 
     
      
    33 The joint judgment of Gummow, Hayne, Heydon and Crennan JJ in Leach recognised (at [38]) that a provision stating that a court or body “may” do something if satisfied of certain matters did not necessarily show that the court had a discretion to exercise. In some situations, for example as discussed in Finance Facilities Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1971) 127 CLR 106 and Mitchell v The Queen (1996) 184 CLR 333, the word “may” will be found to confer a power which is to be exercised upon the court being satisfied of the matters described in the provision. Leach involved such a provision.  
     
      
    34 The onus lies on those who assert that the word “may” has a compulsory meaning to show, as a matter of construction of the Act, taken as a whole, that the word was intended to have such a meaning (Ex parte Gleeson [1907] VLR 368 at 373 per Cussen J). The issue must be determined in the particular statutory context. 
     
      
    35 Pearce & Geddes, Statutory Interpretation in Australia, 6th ed, (2006), Chatswood, state (at [11.3]) that where the purpose or object of the Act would be defeated if a task were not carried out the court will rule that the provision is obligatory and the possessor of the power has no discretion to refuse to exercise it.  
     
      
    36 In some situations there may appear to be no reason to infer a discretion once the repository of the power is satisfied that the circumstances entitle the recipient to a favourable exercise of it (see, eg Finance Facilities (involving a taxation rebate), Bradley v Commonwealth (1973) 128 CLR 557 (involving the right to postal and telegraphic services) and Commissioner of State Revenue (Vic) v Royal Insurance Australia Ltd  (1994) 182 CLR 51 (involving a refund of overpaid tax)).  
     
      
    37 By contrast, the present legislation is restrictive of liberty and could not be seen as an enactment for the benefit of the offender. The stated objects of the Act do not require the provisions in question to be interpreted as involving no element of discretion. 
     
      
    38 Mitchell involved a power to order that a prisoner was not eligible for parole if that was considered “appropriate”. The power was conditional upon a balance being struck, but once this occurred there was really nothing further to weigh. By contrast, s16(1) confers a power to order interim detention by reference only to it appearing that conditions (a) and (b) were satisfied. The terms of condition (b) address the documentation supporting the claim for final relief upon the assumption that the matters alleged are proved. They do not indicate criteria that require to be fulfilled for a favourable exercise of the power to make an interim order. 
     
      
    39 Section 27 states that the Act does not affect the right of any party to proceedings under the Act to call witnesses and give evidence, or to cross-examine witnesses. One would have thought such a provision unnecessary as regards the making of final orders. And the powers to make interim orders are capable of exercise from time to time, obviously, in light of the situation then prevailing. Accordingly, for s27 to have effective work to do, it would appear to be directed at the situation of an offender seeking to resist the making of an interim order where otherwise paras (a) and (b) of ss8 and 16 are formally satisfied. There is no reason why, for instance, an offender could not seek to establish that the matters alleged in the supporting documentation were incapable of proof. At the very least the provision reinforces the conclusion that “may” imports a judicial discretion. 
     
      
    40 A further indicator that the power is not in the nature of a duty stems from the fact that, if it were a duty, ss8 and 16 would present the Court with incompatible statutory commands in a case like the present where each category of final relief is sought and where the supporting documentation discloses that either final order would be justified. 
     
      
    41 The Act draws certain distinctions that are, in our view, relevant to the issue at hand. The first relates to the documentary information that “must” accompany the application for a continuing detention order (see s14(3)) and that which “may” be indicated in the application (see s14(4)). The second distinction is between the “documentation” required to support the application when it is filed (s14(3)) or which must be disclosed (s15(2)), on the one hand, and the “evidence” upon which the application will ultimately be determined by the Supreme Court, on the other (see s17(4)). That “evidence” will obviously include relevant material tendered by the offender in opposition to the application. Furthermore, there is nothing to prohibit the Attorney General from supplementing the original “documentation” by proffering additional evidence, including for example, evidence arising out of the psychiatric examinations of the offender that will take place if and when ordered in accordance with the pre-trial procedure stipulated in s15(4). 
     
      
    42 Accordingly, a true judicial discretion is involved. 
     
      
       
      The interim nature of orders under ss8 and 16 
       
      
    43 The learned judge approached the application on the basis that the lesser of the two interim orders should be made unless he was persuaded that interim detention was warranted in order to provide adequate protection to the community (see Attorney-General for the State of New South Wales v Tillman [2007] NSWSC 356 at J56-57, 60). References hereafter to particular paragraphs of these reasons are indicated J1, J2 etc).  
     
      
    44 There is a strong presumption against construing a statute so that it trenches upon a fundamental right such as the liberty of the subject. However, that presumption is weakened in the present context and would not prevail over the clear and explicit language of the statute with its clearly stated protective and rehabilitating objects. Thus s16 applies where the offender is already in custody and where the claim for final relief is for a continuing detention order. In the instant case, the “supporting documentation” demonstrated that, if proved, the making of a continuing detention order would be justified. Moreover s16(2) and (3) sets the outer limits for the period of any interim detention order and any renewals, namely 28 days maximum for any individual order and no more than 3 months in total with any renewed orders.  
     
      
    45 The statutory objects in this extraordinary legislation are directed at “ensuring” the safety and protection of the community and “facilitating” rehabilitation of serious sex offenders. They also weigh against any strong presumption in favour of liberty prevailing, at least at the interim stage. A final hearing can be brought on with expedition. 
     
      
    46 We see no basis for discounting unchallenged evidence in a particular case that points strongly in the direction of risk-avoidance at the interim stage. However, we do not suggest that there is a general presumption in favour of maintaining the custodial status quo when interim relief is in question. 47 We now address the facts of this particular case. 
     
      
       
      Commencement of proceedings  
       
      
    48 On 11 April 2007 the Attorney General filed a summons claiming a continuing detention order that the respondent be detained in a correctional centre for five years from the date of the order. In the alternative, the Attorney claimed an extended supervision order for a period of five years from the date of the order, with a set of conditions proposed in the summons.  
     
      
    49 The Act had commenced on the date of assent, 3 April 2006. The respondent was on notice of the possibility that an application might be made from as early as 5 September 2006, but he received no confirmation until 11 April 2007 when served with the summons. 
     
      
    50 The Crown Solicitor had first received instructions to advise the appellant on a possible application on 5 April 2007. 
     
      
    51 When served with process, the respondent was imprisoned at the Long Bay Correctional Centre serving the final week of a lengthy sentence of full time imprisonment for serious sex offences. The sentence was to expire on Wednesday 18 April 2007 and he was due to be released from custody on that day. 
     
      
    52 The Attorney General signalled his intention to seek one or other category of interim order in paras 1 - 3 of the summons. A notice of motion was also filed on 11 April and an order made ex parte that day standing the proceedings on the motion over to Monday 16 April. The motion, which was directed to be served by 6pm on 11 April, sought to have the application for interim relief heard and determined on an urgent basis on or before 17 April 2007; and the hearing of the other claims for relief in the summons to be expedited. 53 Four bulky affidavits were filed on Friday 13 April 2007. There was an offer to serve them on counsel for the respondent that day, but in the upshot they were not served until Monday 16 April. The reports attached to some of the affidavits had previously been made available to the respondent. 
     
      
    54 The preliminary hearing and the motion came on for hearing on 16 April before Hoeben J.  
     
      
    55 The summons was filed and served within the statutory time-frames, but its lateness as regards the imminent release of the respondent put the offender and the Court at considerable disadvantage. The exigencies of the situation left Hoeben J with a very short opportunity to address a complex legal and factual situation. The delay on the part of the Attorney General was unexplained and is to be regretted. 
     
      
    56 The Act requires a preliminary hearing into the application to be conducted by the Supreme Court within 28 days after the application is filed or within such further time as the Supreme Court may allow (s15(3)). If, following the preliminary hearing the Court is satisfied that the matters alleged in the supporting documentation would, if proved, justify the making of a final order, the Court must make certain orders for the psychiatric examination of the offender (s15(4)). Such orders were made by Hoeben J on 17 April and are not challenged in this appeal. 
     
      
    57 The application for substantive relief is yet to be heard in the Supreme Court. 
     
      
       
      Orders challenged 
       
      
    58 This appeal related to the orders made by Hoeben J on 17 April 2007 in response to the notice of motion.  
     
      
    59 Hoeben J rejected the Attorney General’s application for an interim detention order under s16(1) of the Act. This was the order under appeal. 
     
      
    60 Instead, his Honour made a 28 day interim supervision order under s8(1) subject to conditions (a) – (i) set out at par 116 below. 
     
      
    61 His Honour’s reasons refer in detail to the respondent’s background and the evidentiary and discretionary matters upon which the decision was based. Our reasons should be read subject to the fuller statement of factual material provided in the judgment of Hoeben J. The matters to which the appellant has directed critical attention will of course be addressed specifically.  
     
      
    62 The case on appeal was stated as follows in the Claimant’s Summary of Argument:  
     
      
       
        
        2. The primary contention of the Attorney General is that Hoeben J erred in making an interim supervision order, rather than an interim detention order under s16(1) of the Act. His Honour’s conclusion that an interim supervision order should be made was the product of a misconstruction of the task with which his Honour was charged under s16. 
        
       
       
        
        3. In particular, in reaching the conclusion that an interim detention order should not be made, the Attorney submits that his Honour: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) erred in his categorisation of the Opponent’s sexual offences; and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) erred in taking into account the Opponent’s refusal to attend the custodial treatment program for sex offenders as a reason for refusing to make an interim detention order, rather than a factor relevant to assessing the risk of the Opponent re-offending. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        4. Further, the Attorney submits that Hoeben J erred in considering that the delay in making the application prejudiced the ability of the Opponent to put on evidence, and that this perceived prejudice was a factor relevant to the exercise of discretion to make an interim detention order. Although this consideration was not determinative, his Honour’s opinion that this was a relevant consideration is at odds with the approach to preliminary applications under the Act adopted by McClelland CJ at CL in  
        Attorney General for New South Wales v Gallagher 
         [2007] NSWSC 420. 
        
       
       
      
    63 The reasons why, as a matter of discretion, the claim was rejected are found in J53-60 which will be set out and addressed below. 
     
      
       
      The factual strength of the appellant’s claims for an interim detention order 
       
      
    64 Some factual background is required in order to address the appellant’s challenges and to lay the groundwork for explaining the order we made upon a re-exercise of the judicial discretion consequent upon finding appealable error. 
     
      
    65 As indicated, the discretion to make either category of interim order was engaged because of the claims for final relief that were made in the alternative in the summons and because the supporting documentation demonstrated that if the matters alleged were proved to the necessary standard on a final hearing the Court would be justified in granting either category of final relief. 
     
      
    66 Not only did the “documentation” support this proposition. The four unchallenged affidavits also did double duty as presenting compelling evidence for the exercise of the discretion in favour of the Attorney General’s preferred interim solution. 
     
      
    67 Four affidavits dated 13 April 2007 that had been served that day were read and their exhibits were tendered. One of the affidavits contained detailed information about the offender’s criminal record. The other three were from psychologists. 
     
      
    68 The affidavit of Ms Callan, a solicitor, provided details of the respondent’s extensive history of offences of a sexual nature, most of them being “serious sex offences” within s5 of the Act. There were other offences, not of a sexual nature, for which the respondent has been convicted and sentenced to terms of imprisonment (see J21). 
     
      
    69 This evidence also demonstrated that imprisonment and the threat of imprisonment had had little or no deterrent impact upon the respondent.  
     
      
    70 The respondent was born on 25 January 1962 and is 45 years old. His criminal record in relation to sexual offences is as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
          
           
           Date of Conviction 
           
          
           
           Conviction 
           
          
           
           Details of sentence 
           
         
         
         23 February 1977 
         Rape of 22 year old woman and larceny in a dwelling 
         8 years imprisonment with a 3 year non-parole period (sentenced 8 September 1977) 
         
         
         10 October 1984 
         Sexual intercourse with a minor (victim 13 year old female) 
         6 years imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 3 years (sentenced 9 November 1984) 
         
         
         17 September 1985 
         Committing an act of indecency on a 15 year old girl 
         Deferred sentence upon payment of a $500 bond (sentenced 17 September 1985 
         
         
         7 November 1990 
         Two counts of sexual intercourse with a person under 16 and assault with an act of indecency on a person under 16 (victim 10 year old female) 
         6 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 4 years and 6 months in respect of the first count of sexual intercourse; 2 years imprisonment in respect of the remaining two offences (sentenced 7 November 1990) 
         
         
         6 March 1998 
         Two counts of sexual intercourse with a person under 10, and one count of attempted sexual intercourse (victim 9 year old female); common assault. 
         10 years imprisonment to date from 19 April 1997 with a non-parole period of 7 years and 6 months and a balance of term of 2 years and 6 months to expire on 18 April 2007. Sentence of 3 months imprisonment for assault to be served concurrently. 
         
        
       
      
    71 The offence of sexual intercourse with a 13 year old female victim for which the respondent was convicted on 10 October 1984 had occurred on 7 August 1982 in breach of parole related to the 1977 rape conviction. 
     
      
    72 The offences of sexual intercourse with a 10 year old female victim, for which the respondent was convicted on 7 November 1990 and sentenced to six years imprisonment, occurred in August 1989, five months after the respondent had been released from custody when imprisoned for a driving offence. The respondent served the entire term of imprisonment for these sexual offences, being released from custody on 9 August 1995.  
     
      
    73 The offences involving a nine year old female victim for which the respondent was convicted on 6 March 1998 occurred in July 1996, within 12 months of his release from previous custody. Following his conviction on 6 March 1998, the respondent served the entirety of the 10 year term of imprisonment that was imposed (dating from 19 April 1997) because the Parole Authority determined to refuse parole. 
     
      
    74 Victoria Bel is a specialist psychologist with the Department of Corrective Services at Long Bay Correctional Centre. She has extensive experience in risk assessment of sex offenders. She has interviewed the respondent on numerous occasions and has often tried to encourage him to participate in the Custody Based Intensive Treatment Sex Offender Program (CUBIT). The respondent has consistently refused to participate in that program. He told Ms Bel that “CUBIT is not appropriate for Aboriginal inmates like me” as well as offering other explanations. 
     
      
    75 Ms Bel’s affidavit concluded with the following summary: 
     
      
       
        
        Mr Tillman’s history of sexual offending indicates victims across a broad age spectrum, and offending behaviour which includes predatory behaviour on victims who are strangers to him, whom he met in relatively public places. The range of offending behaviour would, in my opinion, make it extremely difficult to impose conditions on his release which would meet every group of victim against whom Mr Tillman poses a risk of re-offending, and every area in which he might do so. For example, while it might be possible to place some restrictions on with whom Mr Tillman can live, and interact with on a day to day basis, it will not be possible to restrict him completely from everyday activities, such as going to the supermarket. 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    76 Dr Lennings is a registered psychologist whose report is based on a review of general literature as to the risk of recidivism and the documentation relating to the respondent’s history of sexual offences and ensuing custody. His report cites various “dynamic risk variables” applicable to the respondent, noting that “past supervision failure” was “definitely present” and that “denial or minimisation” was “definite”. He referred to a history of failure to co-operate when being supervised.  
     
      
    77 Dr Lennings’ conclusion was: 
     
      
       
        
        43. I have undertaken a review of the documents as sent to me. I have incorporated into my review of pertinent documents a literature review setting out the grounds upon which the various comments, opinions and scores reported in the file can be interpreted. A constant theme in the various psychologists and probation officer reports is that Mr Tillman is a high risk sexual offender. Risk is defined in relation to opportunity to offend. Were he to be in the community, high risk means high risk of recidivism and a further sexual offence. It is also the case that assessment of his risk has highlighted the features that make him a high risk recidivating offender. These include his high level of risk on actuarial devices, the persistence of high levels of deviant sexual interest, reluctance or inability to achieve insight into his offending, lack of cooperation with supervision and treatment, high levels of self-absorption and lack of empathy, significant anti-social behaviour, lack of viable harm minimisation plans and strategies, and the continuation of offending from an early age until current. It is unlikely he will be responsive to treatment due to his failure in the past to engage with treatment, his self serving comments in relation to it, and the absence of viable and suitably intensive community based programs for him if he were released. It is probable that the most effective treatment for him, if he is to be released, might be biochemical, although medical opinion should be sought about that. Although some risk factors, such as denial and lack of remorse have little relationship to recidivism, they create a psychological environment in which seeking help if he experiences urges to offend, is unlikely to occur. However, it seems to me that it would have been preferable to have had an appropriate assessment of psychopathy to complement the risk assessment. 
        
       
       
        
        44. On the basis of my review it seems that Mr Tillman shares many characteristics in common with those serious offenders who are known to be chronic recidivist offenders. The literature sets out the statistical arguments to this, as it does the reason why certain key dynamic variables are so influential in the decision about recidivism. Whilst approximately 12% of sexual offenders fall into the high risk group, not all will necessarily be high risk offenders. However, the presence of high levels of risk on both actuarial and dynamic risk factors makes it more likely than not that he will be a high risk recidivating sexual offender. There appears to be little in the way of community options that could mitigate the potential he has. In terms of conventional risk assessment methodologies, the likelihood of a sexual offence is high and more likely than not to occur, and the arm attached to such an offence is also likely to be high and enduring given his targets appear more likely to be children than any other age group. 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    78 Mr Bright is a registered psychologist who has held the position of Therapeutic Manager of CUBIT sex offender programs at the New South Wales Department of Corrective Services since June 2003.  
     
      
    79 In September 2006 Mr Bright interviewed the respondent concerning his attitude to the CUBIT program. His report is also based upon departmental files relating to the respondent and reports by psychologists, including psychological assessment reports by Ms Bel. When interviewed in September 2006 the respondent indicated his awareness of the new legislation and his wish not to be kept in gaol after the end of his sentence. He nevertheless again declined to participate in the CUBIT program.  
     
      
    80 Mr Bright prepared a report dated 1 February 2007 expressing the following conclusions: 
     
      
       
        
        Mr Tillman has been assessed as a high risk sexual offender (V. Bel, 15.11.05). It appears that he has expressed denial in respect to all of his sexual offending behaviour. Mr Tillman has been consistently resistant to engaging in the group-based treatment programme run by Corrective Services, which is the most suitable programme given his risk level. There are no programmes in the community which can offer the combination of high treatment intensity and community safety, which are provided by the custody based CUBIT programme. 
        
       
       
        
        It is possible that Mr Tillman’s reluctance to enter CUBIT may be based on shame and embarrassment at having to disclose and acknowledge his range of sexual offending behaviours. Alternatively, he may be unwilling to give up his sexual offending behaviour and therefore not wish to do treatment. The rationale he has provided for not engaging in CUBIT may be simply convenient justifications or excuses which are being used by him to avoid treatment. I have not had the benefit of a comprehensive interview with Mr Tillman, so have thus far been unable to test these hypotheses with him. 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    81 In the affidavit to which this report was annexed Mr Bright expressed the following conclusions: 
     
      
       
        
        69. In my Report I note the conclusion of Ms Bel in her report of 15 November 2006 that Mr Tillman has been assessed as a high risk untreated sexual offender. On the basis of my own scoring of the STATIC-99, and my reading of Ms Bel’s report, in my opinion, Mr Tillman remains a high risk of sexual recidivism. 
        
       
       
        
        70. It appears that Mr Tillman has expressly denied his sexual offending behaviour and has been consistently resistant to engaging in group based treatment program run by the Department. 
        
       
       
        
        71. I believe that CUBIT is the only treatment program that is suitable to address these risks because its high risk intensity is commensurate with those risks. I do not believe that treatment of a sufficiently intensive level to address Mr Tillman’s needs is available in the community. 
        
       
       
        
        72. In relation to the reasons given by Mr Tillman as to his reluctance to enter CUBIT, in my view he may be assisted by attending a Preparatory Program for sexual offenders. This may assist to motivate him to become prepared to enter the CUBIT program. 
         
        
       
       
      The appellant’s submissions 
       
      
    82 It is now convenient to address the challenges to the exercise of the discretion in the instant case. 
     
      
       
      (i) The lateness of the application 
       
      
    83 The applications for final orders were not defective by reason of having been filed only seven days before the respondent was due to be released from custody upon the expiry of a lengthy sentence of imprisonment. Service was effected within the narrow time-frame imposed by ss7(1) and 15(1). 
     
      
    84 The Act contemplates a preliminary hearing conducted by the Supreme Court within 28 days after the application is filed or within such further time as the Supreme Court may allow (ss7(3), 15(3)). This occurred in the proceedings before Hoeben J on 16 April. 
     
      
    85 There is, however, no temporal mandate as to when the Court should hear and determine an application for an interim order, including a renewed application, other than that this will take place in the pending proceedings for “final” relief. 
     
      
    86 At the hearing on Monday 16 April 2007, senior counsel for the respondent, Mr Haesler SC, submitted that the application for interim relief was opposed and that the Crown had “left it too late”. Nevertheless, he did not seek an adjournment nor the opportunity to cross-examine the witnesses who had verified the “documentation” that had accompanied the summons; nor was any evidence sought to be led on behalf of the respondent referable to the exercise of the Court’s discretion. Indeed, Mr Haesler SC stated that: 
     
      
       
        
        Given the nature of the application, the Attorney simply has to show that this material, if proved, would satisfy the tests under the legislation. 
         
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Our hands are tied. Perhaps I should put on the record that that creates a fundamental unfairness. The parliament have, it appears, allowed legislation for that unfairness. Whether that is fundamental in the sense of jurisdiction of this Court may have to be determined at another time. 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    87 It is not disputed that the four affidavits read on the motion included documentation that satisfied both ss6(3) and s14(3). This means that, as regards the presently relevant dispute concerning an interim detention order, the application for a continuing detention order was (s14(3)): 
     
      
       
        
        supported by documentation: 
        
       
       
        
        (a) that addresses each of the matters referred to in section 17(4) and 
        
       
       
        
        (b) that includes a report (prepared by a qualified psychiatrist, registered psychologist or registered medical practitioner) that assesses the likelihood of the offender committing a further serious sex offence. 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    88 In the portion of his reasons headed Decision, Hoeben J referred to the matter of delay as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        53 I am concerned by the fact that the plaintiff’s application has been brought so late, ie seven days before the defendant’s proposed release date. This, in my opinion, gives rise to a fundamental unfairness insofar as the defendant is concerned which must influence my exercise of the discretion granted to me under the Act. No explanation was offered by the plaintiff to explain this delay.  
         
        54 The late nature of these proceedings has prevented the defendant from being in a position to adduce any evidence to enable him to oppose the application. While such evidence (if available) would not have assisted him as to the merits of the claim (s16(1)(b)), it may well have assisted him on the question of what treatment was most appropriate for him and as to whether an extended supervision order, rather than a continuing detention order, was more appropriate in his case. Such evidence might also have assisted in determining what conditions ought be attached to any extended supervision order made against the defendant. The lateness of the proceedings has precluded the defendant from adducing any evidence on those issues. Accordingly, even if I were persuaded to the necessary standard that an interim continuing detention order ought be made against the defendant, I would not make such an order. 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    89 We have already concluded that s16(1) conferred a discretion, enabling the Court in a proper case to decline to make an order for interim detention even if it appeared that conditions (a) and (b) of subs(1) were satisfied. The second sentence in J54 shows that the judge recognised that condition (b) was satisfied. According to the appellant, we should read the reasons as indicating that the Court would have been justified in making either of the alternative orders referred to in (b). We agree. 
     
      
    90 It follows that since the documentation would, if proved, justify the making of either category of final order, then the discretionary power to order interim detention was enlivened for this offender.  
     
      
    91 Nevertheless, his Honour erred, in our respectful view, when in the passage set out he indicated in effect that the lateness of the application was an independent principal ground for refusing an interim detention order.  
     
      
    92 Given that no adjournment was sought and that nothing was led in contradiction of the unchallenged evidence read on behalf of the Attorney General, the delay factor ought not to have been a basis for refusing whatever relief was appropriate. In our view, the evidence summarised above demonstrated convincingly that this was a proper case for an interim detention order effectively continuing the incarceration of the respondent on a temporary basis at this stage in the proceedings. We shall further explain this conclusion below. 
     
      
    93 Nothing was said on behalf of the respondent before Hoeben J to indicate that he intended to adduce evidence going to the making of an interim order of either sort. (For what it is worth, no such evidence was proffered to this Court either, even though this is an appeal by way of rehearing in an interlocutory matter (see Supreme Court Act 1970, s75A(7)-(9)). If the protection of the public called for one or both types of interim order then the Attorney General’s delay (even if unjustifiable) was not a factor that should have carried any weight in the exercise of the discretion. His Honour therefore erred in taking into account an irrelevant consideration. 
     
      
       
      (ii) Inappropriate regard to likely final relief 
       
      
    94 Early in his reasons, Hoeben J said that to enliven the exercise of the Court’s discretion under s16(1) it must appear (among other things) that the evidence demonstrates that adequate supervision will not be provided by an extended supervision order (J17(d)). 
     
      
    95 His Honour’s reasoning as to lateness ([88] above) also treated as significant the strength of the material supporting a final order in the nature of continuing detention as significant in deciding which type of interim order ought to be made. 
     
      
    96 In our opinion this led his Honour into error, because the statutory task was to determine what interim relief was appropriate in a situation where paras (a) and (b) of s16(1) were undoubtedly satisfied and where the evidence going to the appropriateness of interim relief in the nature of continuing detention was all one way. 
     
      
    97 This challenge can be further understood from the following portion of the reasons for Decision: 
     
      
       
        
        55 From material placed before me, and in accordance with the statutory regime, I am persuaded to the necessary standard that the defendant is likely to commit a further serious sex offence if he is not kept under appropriate supervision. His history of sexual offending, the statistical and psychological evidence all indicate that the defendant presents a high risk of re-offending. It follows that the supporting documentation if it is proved would justify the making of an order under the Act. The only question is the nature of that order, ie a continuing detention order or an extended supervision order.  
        
       
       
        
        56 The plaintiff strongly urged that an interim detention order was the only appropriate order. It was submitted that an extended supervision order, even with the conditions set out in the summons, would not provide adequate protection to the community. I am not so persuaded. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        60 For the reasons indicated it seems to me that the objects of the Act are adequately fulfilled if an interim extended supervision order is made against the defendant rather than a continuing detention order. I wish to make it clear that this decision relates purely to this interim application and to the preliminary hearing. This decision will play no part in the ultimate resolution of the plaintiff’s application for final orders. 
         
        
       
      
    98 The task assigned by s16(1)(b) is for the Court to look at what is alleged in the supporting documentation to see whether it would, if proved, justify the making of either a continuing detention order or extended supervision order (s16(1)(b)). In determining whether the power to grant an interim order is enlivened, the Court is not involved in weighing that documentation or predicting the ultimate result. The power is enlivened if the supporting documentation would, if proved, justify the making of either category of final order bearing in mind the elevated standard of proof stated in ss17(2) and (3). That threshold question is to be resolved without considering what evidence might be called by the offender at the final hearing. Indeed, it is to be considered without taking into account the evidence (if any) called by the offender at the interim hearing: such evidence may go to (relevant) discretionary matters, but would not cast light upon what is alleged in the Attorney General’s supporting documentation.  
     
      
    99 Since s16(1)(b) is satisfied if either category of final order would be justified if the matters alleged in the documentation are proved, the Court is not required, at the stage of considering whether the discretionary power to make an interim detention order is engaged, to assess which category of final order is likely to be made at the end of the day. Because the word ""may"" in the closing portion of s16(1) imports a true discretion, it is open for the Court to refuse to make an interim detention order even if conditions (a) and (b) are satisfied. But it would not be a proper exercise of that discretion, in our opinion, for the Court to make an interim supervision order instead of interim detention order simply because the probabilities suggested that an extended supervision order was the more likely (final) candidate. That would involve reading words into the subsection that are not there. If (unlike the present case) there was only a claim for a continuing detention order, then the only options available to the Court under s16(1) would be to make an interim detention order or to dismiss the claim for interim relief. 
     
      
    100 On our reading of J55-6, 60 (set out above) his Honour appears to have approached the s16(1) discretion by forming the view that a (final) continuing detention order will probably not be made if matters stand as they do at present, because ""adequate supervision"" will be able to be provided by an extended supervision order (s17 (3)). Such a reading is drawn primarily from the last sentence of J55 and the reference to ""an extended supervision order"" in J56. In so doing, the judge erred, in our respectful view.  
     
      
    101 It is possible that we have misread this portion of the judge’s reasons. Indeed, the thrust of the opening sentence of J60 suggests that the judge was at that stage weighing the respective merits of an interim detention order and an interim supervision order. If that is all that was occurring in the extended passage of reasons at J55-60, then we would still not agree with the (interim) bottom line, because of our conclusions on the specific matters addressed below and our assessment of the present situation on a re-exercise of the discretion required as a consequence of the error referred to in [93] above. 
     
      
       
      (iii) Factual error in J56 
       
      
    102 In the portion of J56 quoted above his Honour indicated that he rejected the plaintiff’s strong urging that an interim detention order was the only appropriate order and that he was not persuaded that an extended supervision order (with the conditions set out in the summons) would not provide adequate protection to the community.  
     
      
    103 We have already sought to demonstrate why it would appear that the wrong question was posed at this interim stage of the proceedings. Be that as it may, we would in any event disagree with the judge’s response because it was influenced by a factual error of some materiality.  
     
      
    104 In rejecting the application for an interim detention order his Honour said (J56): 
     
      
       
        
        As indicated, the offences of November 1990 and March 1998 both involved female children in his household and substantially under his care. Except for his first offence in 1977, there has been no suggestion in his offending behaviour of him randomly seeking victims in the public arena. The offending situations have arisen when circumstances have brought young victims into close proximity to the defendant. 
        
       
       
      
    105 It was an error of fact to state that there had been no suggestion that the respondent’s offending behaviour involved him randomly seeking victims in the public arena (with the exception of his first offence in 1977). On the contrary, the offence committed on 7 August 1982 for which the respondent was convicted on 10 October 1984 and sentenced to six years imprisonment was also of this nature. The offence involved the respondent engaging a 13 year old girl and her young boyfriend in conversation, ascertaining that they had run away from home, and offering to put them up for the night at the respondent’s home. The young couple were taken to Windsor by the respondent and another man. The vehicle stopped at South Windsor. The girl, her boyfriend and the respondent alighted and the vehicle was driven away. The respondent then persuaded the young boy to wait behind. He then took the young girl into a bush area where he had sexual intercourse with her against her will. 
     
      
    106 This ground is established. 
     
      
       
      (iv) Significance of respondent’s present attitude to treatment or rehabilitation programs 
       
      
    107 One of the matters that the Court will need to consider closely when it comes to decide what, if any, final order should be made is stated in s17(4)(e) as: 
     
      
       
        
        any treatment or rehabilitation programs in which the offender has had an opportunity to participate, the willingness of the offender to participate in any such programs, and the level of the offender’s participation in any such programs… 
        
       
       
      
    108 Hoeben J addressed this issue in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
         
        38 In relation to s17(4)(e) – treatment or rehabilitation programs – I have already indicated the defendant’s refusal to participate in the CUBIT Program and his reasons for adopting this stance. The defendant told Ms Bel that he had read research suggesting that the CUBIT Program was not effective, he was concerned about its lack of confidentiality and he was afraid because the CUBIT Program was located in the building which was the scene of his sexual assault as an adolescent some 28 years before. Ms Bel noted that the defendant was not receptive to information that this building had been extensively renovated and would bear little resemblance to how it looked at the time of his assault, nor would the defendant agree to participate in a systematic desensitisation process as a preparation to entering the CUBIT Program. It was Ms Bel’s opinion that it was unlikely that any form of community treatment would offer the level of intensity of the CUBIT Program.  
        
       
       
        
        39 The defendant’s refusal to attend the CUBIT Program has emerged as a significant issue. It is therefore necessary to say something about that program. The first intake was in 1999. It is designed for sex offenders with a moderate to high risk of re-offending. This is because of its high intensity nature. The program is conducted in a residential unit. Offenders admitted to the program are accommodated in a special self-contained, forty bed unit located in the Metropolitan Special Program Centre at Long Bay Correctional Centre. The setting is designed to help offenders work intensively on changing the thinking, attitudes and feelings which led to their offending behaviour.  
        
       
       
        
        40 The CUBIT facility is run as a “therapeutic community” in which offenders practise newly acquired skills, behaviours and attitudes on a daily basis with advice and feedback from specially trained psychologists and custodial officers. The unit is self-contained and is intended to provide a safe context for the practice and exercise of more pro-social attitudes and behaviours. Since August 2005 groups have been run three mornings per week for approximately 2.5 hours each morning. Between sessions, participants are expected to complete written homework tasks, practise new skills, consider and process the specific issues they are currently working on and provide support and encouragement to other offenders in the community. Weekly community meetings and other community activities underscore the importance of community involvement for all participants and assist with the attainment of treatment goals. 
        
       
       
        
        41 During the program participants are expected to take responsibility for their offending behaviour, examine victim issues, identify their offence cycle and develop a detailed relapse prevention program. The CUBIT Program runs for approximately eight – ten months. Because it is a residential program, it is intended that even when participants are not in a group they are in a custom built environment and are working on the new skills they are learning for the whole time. Once an offender has successfully completed the CUBIT Program, the offender must participate in a maintenance program one morning per week.  
        
       
       
        
        42. Mr Bright has been actively involved in the CUBIT Program. In his affidavit he noted that group therapy such as the CUBIT Program is “almost universally recognised as the treatment modality of choice with sexual offenders”. Having said that, Mr Bright also referred to research that “despite sound theoretical rationales for employing group therapy rather than individual therapy, and despite the preference for group therapy among the majority of sexual offender treatment providers, there is little evidence of differential treatment efficacy with adult sexual offenders”. (Affidavit, para 39.) It seems that group treatment for sexual offenders is more time and cost efficient than individual therapy and this may well explain its preference as treatment in correctional institutions.  
         
        
       
      
    109 In explaining why he was not persuaded that an interim detention order was the only appropriate order, Hoeben J said (J58-60): 
     
      
       
        
         
        58 The other matter urged upon me by the plaintiff relates to the rehabilitation objectives of the Act. It was submitted that the defendant should be kept in prison because it was only in prison that he would be able to complete the CUBIT Program with its residential requirements and necessary level of intensity. Informal one on one counselling outside the prison system would not be sufficient. 
        
       
       
        
        59 Implicit in that submission is the unstated premise that the defendant must participate in the CUBIT Program or he should not be released. Since the defendant has (to his very real detriment) consistently refused to participate in the CUBIT Program whilst serving his sentence of imprisonment, I do not see why his attitude would change if he were to be further detained in the prison system. In the circumstances of this case I do not see it to be appropriate for the court to assist in a process which forces a person to unwillingly undergo medical treatment as a condition of obtaining that person’s liberty.  
        
       
       
        
        60 For the reasons indicated it seems to me that the objects of the Act are adequately fulfilled if an interim extended supervision order is made against the defendant rather than a continuing detention order. I wish to make it clear that this decision relates purely to this interim application and to the preliminary hearing. This decision will play no part in the ultimate resolution of the plaintiff’s application for final orders. 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    110 The respondent’s attitude to rehabilitation, as indicated in the documentation consisting of the reports of the three psychologists, well and truly satisfied the statutory threshold referable to s17(4)(e) as it was to be applied at the interim stage of the proceedings. 
     
      
    111 We have already indicated why the legislative scheme did not require the judge to weigh up the impact of this material beyond satisfying himself that it was part of the supporting documentation which would, if proved, justify the making of either category of final order. 
     
      
    112 Since, however, there remained a judicial discretion to refuse either category of interim relief being sought or both, it was appropriate for his Honour to have regard to the evidence on this topic relevant to the granting of interim relief. 
     
      
    113 This said, it is not easy to see the materiality of the CUBIT evidence to the exercise at hand, namely determining which of two available courses of interim action ought to be made. Since, however, the primary judge had regard to this material, we should indicate that we draw from it the opposite conclusion to that reached by his Honour.  
     
      
    114 The presently unchallenged evidence shows that the respondent has consistently spurned the CUBIT program offered to him while serving his latest term of imprisonment. The effectiveness of the program for the respondent and his reasons for refusing to embark upon it may call to be examined at a later stage of the proceedings. But, at this stage, the evidence suggests that the CUBIT program is a significant tool of rehabilitation. Its outright and repeated rejection by the respondent leaves unanswered concerns going to a heightened risk of recidivism. 
     
      
    115 We do not share his Honour’s view that the appellant’s case carries the unstated premise that the respondent must participate in the CUBIT program or he should not be released (J59). It is too early in the proceedings to draw any such inference or to weigh the submission that it lies upon the Attorney General to offer some equivalent program in the context of half-way houses for recently released offenders (cf Gallagher at [77]). But equally it is too early to draw a counter-inference, unsupported by evidence or compelling argument, that the respondent’s attitude would be both justified and an answer to the particular inquiry that will be initiated by s17(4)(e) at the final hearing. 
     
      
    116 The evidence concerning the respondent’s attitude to CUBIT coupled with the absence, at this stage, of any material showing that the respondent is prepared to acknowledge that he has a continuing problem needing to be addressed, create a strong factor in favour of continuing detention on an interim basis, having regard to the statutory objects. 
     
      
       
      (v) Inadequacy of conditions of interim supervision 
       
      
    117 Hoeben J made an interim supervision order subject to the following conditions: 
     
      
       
        
         (a) The defendant reside at an address approved by a Corrective Services Officer. 
        
       
       
        
        (b) The defendant accept home visits by a Corrective Services Officer as directed by that officer. 
        
       
       
        
        (c) The defendant report to a Corrective Services Officer as directed by that officer. 
        
       
       
        
        (d) The defendant not to change his place of residence without prior approval of a Corrective Services Officer. 
        
       
       
        
        (e) The defendant not to associate or make contact with children aged 16 years and under unless the child is accompanied by a parent or by a Corrective Services Officer. 
        
       
       
        
        (f) The defendant is not to attend public places regularly frequented by children and in which children are present at the time including, but not limited to, schools and amusement parlours, and such places as a Corrective Services Officer may direct. 
        
       
       
        
        (g) The defendant is to wear electronic monitoring equipment as directed by a Corrective Services Officer. 
        
       
       
        
        (h) The defendant is not to change his name from Kenneth Davidson Tillman. 
        
       
       
        
        (i) The defendant is to participate in treatment and rehabilitation as directed by a Corrective Services Officer, save that such treatment and rehabilitation shall not include the CUBIT Program or a group based program. 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    118 With two modifications, these were the conditions proposed in the summons as the basis for a final order by way of extended supervision in the event that the Court rejected the Attorney General’s preferred claim for an extended detention order. The modifications were the addition to condition (e) of the words “unless the child is accompanied by a parent or by a Corrective Services Officer” and the portion of condition (i) commencing with the word “save” (see J51). 
     
      
    119 Once again, we have considerable sympathy for the plight in which the judge was placed given the lateness of the application. 
     
      
    120 However, the conditions proposed do not satisfy us as providing adequate provision on an interim basis to tilt the scales in favour of interim supervision rather than interim detention. We therefore respectfully disagree with his Honour’s conclusion in this regard and have, exercising the judicial discretion afresh consequent upon our earlier conclusions, arrived at a different conclusion.121 The presently unchallenged evidence points strongly towards a significant risk of reoffending. An electronic monitoring device will certainly assist in tracking the respondent’s movements as well as deter him from risking committing the offence of breach of conditions of a supervision order. But it will scarcely trigger a preventative police response in sufficient time for effective intervention. Ms Bel’s evidence (at [75] above) supports this view. The respondent’s history of failure to co-operate when being supervised referred to in [77] above does not support his Honour’s conclusion that he can be effectively supervised such as to provide adequate protection to the community. 
     
      
    122 In Attorney-General v Gallagher, the Chief Judge at Common Law, ordered interim detention and declined to order interim supervision. He said (at [83[-[85]): 
     
      
       
        
        83 Having regard to the defendant’s previous pattern of offending, I am not presently persuaded that electronic monitoring, in any form, would presently provide sufficient protection from the prospect of him re-offending. The evidence before me indicates that at best the available devices may, if functioning appropriately, alert the authorities to the fact that he has either left a designated location or has intruded into an area from which he has been prohibited, but it could be hours before he was subsequently located.  
        
       
       
        
        84 Given the pattern of his previous offences, and the fact that he, upon release, would not appear to presently have the prospect of a permanent home, the defendant would, in my opinion, have the opportunity to re-offend before he could be located.  
        
       
       
        
        85 The defendant’s past behaviour does not suggest that he will accept the obligations as to his movements which might be imposed if he was released under supervision. Having regard to his antecedents, and the present state of the evidence, I am not satisfied that adequate supervision could be provided by an extended supervision order. The defendant, when last in the community, failed to report in accordance with the  
        Child Protection (Offenders) Registration) Act 
          
        2000  
        (NSW) and has expressed a wish to disappear when released from custody. In my opinion a supervision order is not appropriate and, at this stage, an interim detention order must be made. However, I stress again that the findings which I have expressed are made having regard to the evidence which is presently available, all of which would require reconsideration at a final hearing where substantive orders are under consideration. 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    123 The situation of the present respondent is not apparently as pessimistic as that of Mr Gallagher. Clearly there are points of distinction. But the basic reservation concerning the efficacy of monitoring devices stated by McClellan CJ at CL at [83] is one that we share and would apply to this respondent in light of the evidence. Once again, we emphasise that this is but an interim application and that our expression of opinion is not intended to foreclose a contrary view being reached at a later interim application or at the final hearing in the context of the evidence and fuller arguments than available to us. The Act does not require the avoidance of every conceivable risk. 
     
      
       
      Postscript 
       
      
    124 The concerns that moved his Honour were capable of redress in a proper case. If the offender had sought an adjournment of the hearing of the motion then it would have been open to the Court to have granted it on normal principles. The late filing of the “documentation” relied upon might have generated grounds for an adjournment of the motion had it been sought. A decision on that putative application would have required investigation as to whether the offender had any, and if so, what, prior notice of the documentation contained in the four affidavits of 13 April, especially the documentation relied upon as compliant with s14(3). It is true that s16(1)(b), standing alone, does not entail any opportunity to challenge the accuracy of the “supporting documentation” but s17(4) spreads over a wide range and in the present case the supporting documentation was bulky. A defendant ought to have a sufficient opportunity to consider it to see if it addresses all of the s17(4) matters, as well as a proper opportunity to examine and respond to any evidence relied upon as grounding interim relief. 
     
      
    125 We would urge the Attorney General and the Legal Aid Commission, which presumably will be providing representation for offenders in similar applications in the future, to endeavour to formulate some protocol whereby advance notice may be provided to the relevant offender and to the Court where an application, including an application for interim relief, is on the cards.

    JUDGMENT1. On 29 March 2007 I sentenced Mr Jim Mouroufas to a period of imprisonment in respect of matters to which he had pleaded guilty. The non-parole period I directed to expire on that date or shortly before that date. The parole period commenced on that date and expires in June next year. 2. Mr Mouroufas comes from South Australia where his wife and children reside. I recommended in my sentence that steps be taken to transfer his parole including supervision to South Australia so that he could be with his family. 3. Mr Mouroufas has been pursuing that course through the New South Wales parole authorities but it is taking a long time. He has recently been told that it might be several months more. He has tendered before me today two medical certificates which I have admitted and will mark as exhibits 1 and 2. One of them concerns the health of his wife and is from a medical practitioner who is treating her and is dated 17 April 2007. Without going into the details of the condition for which she is being treated, the doctor expressed the view that it would ""help her treatment immensely if her husband can return to Adelaide to support her through her illness ASAP"". A second certificate was obtained by Mr Mouroufas from his own medical practitioner Dr Buckley. It was dated 23 April 2007. It points out that he has been suffering diabetes and that condition has deteriorated over the last few years partly due to the inadequate diet which he received during the period of his imprisonment. 4. Dr Buckley supported his application for parole transfer back to Adelaide so that he can start to address his dietary issues with the support of his family:  
     
      
      “I realise it is almost impossible for anyone with his medical condition to prepare his own meals according to the dietician's instructions if he is living in a hotel for his health. Jim requires a stable environment so that he can regain his diabetic control and address the various health issues"".  
       
      
    5. I am somewhat reluctant to remove the requirement for supervision but in this case it seems that the requirement for supervision is having significant damaging effects upon the health and well being of both the offender Mr Mouroufas and his wife. I have therefore determined that an appropriate course is to delete that requirement in order to expedite the return of Mr Mouroufas to South Australia. This will hopefully lead to an improvement in the health of both him and his wife. I'll pause there. Ms Jeffreys, I'm not sure how I'll do it. JEFFREYS: I don't believe there's a specific section of the Crimes Sentencing Procedure Act which allows your Honour to do that. It's simply a matter I believe that your Honour will do it in the interests of justice. It's not a matter which would fall within section 43. HIS HONOUR: That's the section, to revise a sentence. Let's just do it.6. I therefore direct in respect of the sentence I imposed on Mr Mouroufas that the condition that the parole be supervised be deleted.

      [2007] NSWIRComm 1024 
     1 Ms Lina Rapone, (the ""Applicant"") filed a claim pursuant to s. 84 of the Industrial Relations Act 1996 on 10 May 2006 seeking relief for her alleged unfair dismissal by the Director-General of the Department of Education and Training (DET). The Applicant commenced employment with the Respondent on 28 January, 1978. At the time of her dismissal, 20 April, 2006, the Applicant was engaged as a Primary School Principal, Grade 3, pursuant to the provisions of the Crown Employees (Teachers in Schools and TAFE and Related Employees) Salaries and Conditions Award. 
     2 Conciliation attempts before Murphy C failed and the matter was allocated to the Commission as currently constituted for hearing on 27 and 28 February 2007.

     BACKGROUND 
     6 The Applicant tendered an affidavit in the proceedings in which she provided a detailed and impressive record of her qualifications and experience in the field of education.  
     7 She commenced as Principal of Warrawee Public School in January 2002. 19 July 2004 was a pupil-free day and that first day of term was scheduled to be utilised for staff training, part of which was to be a joint session with staff at Gordon East Public School. She described herself as being under a great deal of stress on that particular day. After locking up and setting the alarm at the school, she had to go back into the staff room to collect some material she had left behind. She noticed an open handbag on a table in the staff room. She picked up the handbag and returned to her car. 
     8 During the drive to Gordon East Public School, she received a telephone call from a teacher advising that another teacher's handbag had been stolen. The Applicant did not disclose that she had picked up a handbag from the staff room. Whilst at Gordon East Public School, a teacher peeked into Ms Rapone's parked car, noticed the strap of the handbag protruding from beneath the front passenger seat floor mat and called the Police. The Applicant was interviewed by the Police and subsequently charged with theft on 23 August 2004. On 17 December 2004, the Applicant was convicted of larceny and on 03 February 2005 the Magistrate made a finding of guilt but declined to enter a conviction conditional upon Ms Rapone entering into a good behaviour bond for a period of two years. 
     9 In the meantime, the Applicant had been on separate periods of sick leave, long service leave and leave without pay. As required, she had attended for HealthQuest assessments. 
     10 The Applicant was provided with an opportunity to make a submission to the Department as to why disciplinary measures should not be taken against her. The Applicant provided a detailed response. The Applicant was asked to resign or be terminated from her employment. The Applicant sought, and was granted, extensions of time in order to pursue an appeal/annulment against her sentence. 
     11 On 16 March 2006 the Director-General wrote to solicitors for Ms Rapone informing them that the Department would not progress the matter in accordance with their request and that Ms Rapone would be suspended without pay pending the outcome of her appeal. Up until that date she had been on full pay. 
     12 In the absence of a resignation from the Applicant, the Respondent dismissed her by correspondence dated 20 April 2006, effective from the same day. 
     13 Ms Rapone gave evidence that she had planned to work with the Department until the retirement age of 55 years and then continue working in the field of education and training in other capacities and roles, including the provision of consulting work to the Department and other educational and training institutions involving particularly disadvantaged children and young people. She had also hoped to contribute to the community by participating on the Boards of not-for-profit charitable organizations. 
     14 She believed that, considering the discretions vested in the Department in terms of the range of options available to it where an employee is convicted of a criminal offence, the Department, in the current circumstances, acted in a manner which was harsh, unjust and unfair to her.  
     15 She is seeking the remedy of reinstatement, re-employment or compensation, including payment of wages and benefits in the period out of employment pointing out that she is prepared to go to any location, and work in any capacity the Department may require of her if her employment was to be reinstated. 
     16 The Department argued that the matter of Ms Rapone's guilt of deliberately taking a subordinate's handbag with a view to permanently depriving her of it has been permanently determined, and determined beyond reasonable doubt, by a court equipped to make that decision. The Respondent relied on the fundamental principle embodied in the maxim res judicata pro veritate accipitur which expresses the need for determinations which have not been set aside or quashed to be accepted as incontrovertibly correct: Rogers v R (1994) 181 CLR 251 at 273 per Deane and Gaudron JJ. 
     17 On that basis, the Applicant, it was submitted, cannot advance any argument in her s. 84 claim which has the effect of attacking or contradicting the finding of guilt. However, she can advance an argument to the Commission that the decision to dismiss her was harsh or unjust or unreasonable in the circumstances where she was guilty of that larceny. Nevertheless, The Respondent held the view that a school principal who intentionally steals a subordinate’s handbag, containing money and other things, is not a person who should continue to work for the Department as a principal or in any other capacity. 
     MEDICAL ASSESSMENTS 
     18 It is a departmental policy that prior to disciplinary action being commenced against an officer, the Department determines, via a HealthQuest examination, whether there is a link between the officer's actions and a medical condition.  
     19 In August 2004, during a period of sick leave, Ms Rapone was referred to HealthQuest for assessment. 
     20 Ms Rapone was psychiatrically assessed by Dr K Walker, Consultant Psychiatrist on 15 September 2004. In correspondence from HealthQuest dated 29 September 2004 regarding that assessment, it was recommended that Ms Rapone not resume duties as a School Principal until further psychometric assessment was carried out in order to either clarify the nature and severity of any cognitive deficits that may be present or to exclude them. Once that was carried out, it would then be possible to make a more definitive recommendation regarding her fitness to continue.  
     21 Ms Rapone was further assessed by Dr H. Stambouliah, Consultant Psychiatrist, on 19 October 2004. In its report, dated 02 February 2005, HealthQuest raised some concerns about her psychological and cognitive functions. The report stated that Ms Rapone ""did not report any major problems at school with her staff, students or their parents. She added that she was not under stress in her social or personal life."" The report further went on to state that Ms Rapone had admitted that she had felt nervous and uncomfortable when examined by Dr Walker and further admitted that she had denied any depressed mood when he interviewed her. Dr Stambouliah reported that ""She was initially guarded and denied any problems or depressed mood. However, she gradually became more relaxed and expressed some tears when she talked about her pressures at work..."". HealthQuest recommended that ""Ms Rapone should be provided with alternate duties (eg Project Work at Regional Office) and be given access to the EAP services for use in case of any distress. She should be monitored by her employer for any changes in behaviour and referred back to HealthQuest for reassessment in 6 months."" 
     22 There was a further assessment by Dr H Stambouliah, Consultant Psychiatrist, on 26 April 2005. On 17 May 2005, HealthQuest provided a written report in which it was stated that Ms Rapone did not complain of any psychosocial problems or cognitive difficulties. She had demonstrated improvements in various cognitive and memory functions. It was recommended that, ""Ms Rapone undergo a trial return to work period at a school other than Warrawee Public School, where her performance could be monitored for at least six months. Should any further concerns about her behaviour, performance or cognitive functioning arise, she should be reviewed at HealthQuest. She should also be provided with access to the EAP services to assist her in the management of any future distress."" 
     23 Correspondence dated 14 June 2005 was forwarded from DET to HealthQuest indicating that it would be impossible to implement a trial return to work. The Respondent sought a referral of the Applicant to Dr Walker for final review to determine Ms Rapone's fitness to continue as a Principal. 
     THE APPLICANT'S EVIDENCE24 Ms Rapone tendered an affidavit in the proceedings in which she provided a detailed and impressive record of her qualifications and experience in the field of education. That evidence was not contested. The work history is summarised below.Background to Engagement at Warrawee Public School25 The Applicant gave evidence that her previous appointment with the Department was a tenured contract position at Stewart House for a 3-year term from January 1999.  
     26 During the period from about mid-2001 until January 2002, the Applicant was employed as a full time Principal and Chief Executive Officer at Stewart House, a charity which relies predominantly on funding and other support from NSW public schools for its operating budget. As she shared on-call responsibilities with the Deputy Principal 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, it was necessary for her to live on campus with her partner. 
     27 During that time and up until mid-April 2002, the Applicant was involved in a fundraising project for Stewart House. The project, the ""Stewart House Revue"", was scheduled for performance in about April 2002 at St Ives High School Hall and involved 2 evening rehearsals per week commencing from January 2002. She had developed the program, obtained maximum exposure for it and rallied support for it from teaching colleagues both at Warrawee and in other public schools. In addition to the above, she had enlisted the help of her partner in costume design, set design and sewing for the Revue. The Applicant recalled spending approximately one day each weekend during that period assisting with costuming, sewing and set design. 
     28 During 2001, she became eligible for a transfer to another school at the same promotional level as the position she occupied at Stewart House. On or about June 2001, she recalled receiving a telephone call from Ms Mariane Craig and being advised of her transfer to Warrawee Public School, Turramurra. During that conversation, she was advised that not only was it the only available position but it was an offer she could not decline without providing a very good reason. 
     29 The Applicant stated that she was aware that the transfer would result in a huge cultural shift for her considering that the vast majority of her teaching experience had been with educationally disadvantaged children who had special learning needs arising out of disability or behavioural problems, or in areas of juvenile justice and mental health. Nevertheless, she had not lodged a formal objection to the pending transfer.  
     30 Ms Rapone stated that most of the staff at Warrawee had notched up very long service at the school - in some instances over two decades - and two previous principals, more senior in age than the applicant, had completed their teaching career and retired whilst at that School.  
     31 Ms Rapone stated that she got off on a bad start at that school months before her appointment as Principal took effect. Soon after being advised of her appointment, she received a call from Mr Peter Haig, then Superintendent of Ryde Districts Schools, who instructed her to arrange a ""meet and greet"" visit to Warrawee Public School. She attended the School in late June 1991 only to discover that the School had not been advised of her appointment. The Acting Principal and other staff, it seemed, had anticipated that the Acting Principal would be promoted to that position. She recalled that she had been met with expressions of surprise during that visit and particularly recalled three brief conversations. Firstly, Mrs Julie Taylor said to her words to the effect that both her appointment as Principal and the visit had taken the staff by surprise as they had no prior knowledge of either. Secondly, Ms Prue Wright, who appeared to the Applicant to be angry and flushed, advised her that she had been appointed as Acting Principal for terms 3 and 4 in 2001 and was concerned about how the Applicant's appointment was going to affect her. Finally, an executive staff member, said to her words to the effect that “Prue [Wright] is going to be upset. She was appointed to be Acting Principal and it is her first day in that position and she was hoping to get appointed Principal on merit at the end of the year”. 
     32 Appointment to the position of Principal may be made by nominated transfer or by “merit’ on application. The Applicant, in the belief that Mrs Wright's appointment would have raised a reasonable expectation of permanent appointment under a merits review at the end of term 4, said that she recalled feeling embarrassed at the timing of her visit to the school, uncomfortable for the position in which Mrs Wright had been placed and a little concerned that their first meeting had begun with an awkward start bearing in mind Mrs Wright was to remain at the School as her Assistant Principal. 
     33 Her commitments at Stewart House were such that the Applicant had very little available time to herself or to be away from campus. Consequently, despite receiving the Warrawee Public School newsletters and invitations to attend various school functions and activities toward the end of the school year, she had elected to decline for two reasons. Firstly, the functions co-incided with the busiest period at Stewart House and, secondly, bearing in mind the tense atmosphere at their first meeting, she considered that it was desirable to allow Mrs Wright to complete her term as Acting Principal without interference from her.  
     Relationship between the Applicant and the School Community 
     34 She commenced her fifth position as Principal of a public school at Warrawee at the beginning of Term 1 in 2002. Ms Rapone described her attitude to work at the time of her commencement at Warrawee Public School as being that of a determined, driven and forthright leader who was a strong advocate for renewal and change in the workplace in an effort to improve both learning outcomes and the learning environment for students. 
     35 She had been set priorities by the Department - To improve educational outcomes for all students; to increase enrolment levels; and to work to increase student retention rates, particularly at the ends of the Years 2 and 4. By mid-2004, Ms Rapone had embarked on a series of wide-ranging changes which have been described in a chronology provided at the hearing. 
     36 Consistent with her personal belief that one's private life should be kept divorced from one's work life, the Applicant had shared knowledge of her sexual orientation and the relationship with her partner with a select group of family, friends and work colleagues. 
     37 The chronology listed a number of difficulties which she had encountered during the period of her employment at Warrawee - with the Treasurer of the P & C Association (early 2002), with staff as a result of the appointment of a General Assistant (mid 2002) mounting tension with staff and other stressful incidents (2003) and the defacement of her Reserved Parking sign (2004). 
     38 Shortly after commencement at Warrawee, Mrs Lyndall McCulloch, an Assistant Principal, informed her that the school community (parents and teachers) had formed the impression that she was not going to take up the appointment because they perceived her failure to attend school activities prior to her appointment to be a lack of interest on her part. Ms Rapone was further advised that she had been referred to as the ""phantom principal”. Ms Rapone had provided the reasons for her non-attendance adding that she would have offered assistance if she had become aware of any significant issues. 
     39 At about that time, the Applicant had a conversation with Mrs Wright, who was then the Assistant Principal at Warrawee Public School. Mrs Wright expressed anger and disappointment at being denied the ability to apply for the position of Principal as she believed she would have been appointed on the basis of merit. The Applicant explained that she had no choice in the matter as it was a nominated transfer. 
     40 Shortly after her appointment as Principal of that School, she observed certain behaviour that did not auger well with the priorities that she had been set. For example, the administrative staff answered the telephone by saying “Warrawee School” not Warrawee Public School; the school letterhead did not have the word “Public” on it but was simply “Warrawee School”: the Warrawee Public School newsletter accepted advertising from private schools; very little, if any, interaction with other local State High Schools; nil participation in curriculum or social linkage programs operating between other State Primary and High Schools in the district; and students from Warrawee Public School used many facilities of a sporting and educational nature from nearby private schools and attended performances at nearby private schools. She recalled receiving criticism from Principals of other public schools (for example, Boronia Park and Lane Cove West) about her school's apparent preference for association with private schools.41 Enrolment and exit data for that school had disclosed that there was a significant and increasing exit of students to surrounding private schools except for those students who gained entry to a Selective High School. The exodus of students to private schools directly and negatively impacted on staff numbers, funding and other resources of the school.42 Ms Rapone stated that throughout her engagement at Warrawee, she had embarked on a course of changes which were within her scope of authority as principal, were in the best interests of the students and teachers and were consistent with the policy and procedure of both the Department of Education and Training, and/or Primary Principals Association, as well as the Principal’s Priorities. The Applicant detailed examples of some of those changes and the adverse comments she recalled receiving from some members of staff who opposed those changes. 
     43 Ms Rapone was aware that both the parents and some teachers at the school were irritated and upset that she did not encourage a connection between local private schools and Warrawee Public School. She recalled being advised, during a staff meeting, that there was a great deal of dissatisfaction among the staff and parents about her refusal to allow the school, in the absence of those resources, to use the facilities of private schools. A complaint was made to her that she was changing the nature of the school and its relationship with its neighbouring private schools. The Applicant stated that she had explained that their role was to promote the differences between private and public schools thereby curbing the exodus of students to the former. She had further explained that her aim was to attract students because they were being offered better academic and social outcomes than private schools and not just those who simply cannot afford to be in private schools. 
     44 One of the changes she had implemented included the adoption in 2002 of the Primary Principals Association policy not to provide a written reference for a student leaving the public system to enrol in a private school. She recalled that its introduction had caused a high level of anxiety and dissatisfaction among parents, at least 20 of whom had insisted that the enrolling schools required those references and pointed out to her that it had not been an issue for the previous 2 principals. She also became aware that many of her teachers had provided those references on a private basis, including her Assistant Principal. She was aware that all her teachers, bar one, who had school age children, had enrolled them in private schools. 
     45 In the belief that there was little community service involved in the practice, the Applicant had discouraged the practice of private school students attending Warrawee Public School for the community service component of the Duke of Edinburgh Awards program.  
     46 The Applicant had instructed staff that whenever Warrawee Public School required space or other resources for its school bands or awards ceremonies, they were no longer to use the facilities of private schools for such activities. Instead, they were required to improvise or contact local primary and high schools and arrange to use their resources. 
     47 Warrawee Public School had a split campus. Kindergarten to Year 2 (the Infant campus) was located on one side of the public road and was administered by a clerical officer, Mrs Lawrence, who occupied a very significant position at the school because she had managed, over her 20 or so years employment, to develop close relationships with the teaching staff and many of the parents. Years 3 - 6 (the Senior campus) was located on the other side of the road together with the Principal's office. The Applicant formed the view that there was a perception, even amongst the staff, that the campuses were autonomous and parents saw the graduation from Year 2 as a convenient point to move their children out to other schools. 
     48 Ms Rapone formed the view that because the Principal's office was located within the Senior campus, it was an inefficient use of school resources bearing in mind that the infant's division was the most important campus in terms of the opportunities to form relationships with the students and their families. She made the decision during 2002 to switch locations with Mrs Lawrence. 
     49 In term 3 of the 2003 school year, the Applicant tabled a plan for the relocation. The plan further proposed that the Senior Clerical Assistant, who was located in the Senior campus would assume direct supervision of the Clerical Assistant, Mrs Lawrence, and manage the allocation of clerical work. The staff were invited to join a Committee, chaired by Assistant Principal, Mrs Kathy Ash, which was specifically set up to discuss the plan over two school terms. The staff were informed that any concerns expressed to the Committee would be addressed by her at a staff meeting at the end of the last term of 2003. 
     50 Ms Rapone stated at the conclusion of the staff meeting she had called to discuss the relocation plan, she had left in a very distressed and unsettled state because of the degree of aggression directed towards her. Mrs Evans, a Year 2 teacher, had shouted at her, calling her management style authoritarian and accused her of failing to listen to anybody's concerns. The silence maintained by the other staff in the face of Mrs Evan’s tirade had further destabilized her because she was unsure whether it was a result of their embarrassment at, or acquiescence with, that teacher's conduct.  
     51 The Applicant formed the view that Mrs Lawrence was very hostile to the relocation proposal. During another such meeting, Mrs Lawrence had expressed the view that the Applicant's actions were a direct attack on her authority. She recalled that Mrs Lawrence had written a letter outlining the importance of the Clerical Assistant’s role and highlighting her concerns arising from the proposed relocation of the Clerical Assistant’s office. 
     52 Ms Rapone had weighed up the competing views and considered the recommendations of the Committee prior to advising staff of her decision to proceed with the relocation on a trial basis. 
     53 From then on, she noticed a significant change in Mrs Lawrence's behaviour towards her which both upset and destabilised the Applicant. For example, Mrs Lawrence refused an instruction to provide teaching staff with access to the security code for the photocopier and on every occasion she released it to the staff, Mrs Lawrence would change the code without consultation with her. In addition, she estimated that Mrs Lawrence had challenged at least 70 per cent of her requests to perform administrative work. Further, Mrs Lawrence had refused her request to print additional awards for presentation to the students at assembly because she believed that to issue any more would simply devalue the impact of the ones already handed out. The relationship between Ms Rapone and Mrs Lawrence deteriorated further to the point where the latter refused to even exchange pleasantries with the Applicant and demanded, in early 2004, that there be no further verbal communications between them. Despite Ms Rapone's protests, Mrs Lawrence had communicated with her henceforth through a 3rd party or in writing. 
     54 From early 2003 onwards, she had worried and stressed about her relationship with other staff members. She believed that the deliberate and sustained course of mischievous conduct she had been subjected to was designed to irritate and unsettle her. Conversations ceased when she entered the staff room; notices, stickers and posters she had placed on School Notice Boards disappeared; an autographed photograph of Bob Hawke she had found in a storeroom and placed among other photographs of politicians and prominent people in a locked display cabinet in the foyer of the School was found, almost on a daily basis, to have been moved and placed face down in the cabinet. 
     55 As a result of the relocation, Ms Rapone did not have a designated parking spot in the staff only car park in the Infant campus. Therefore, if her commitments as Principal resulted in her arriving at work later than other teaching staff, she experienced difficulty in obtaining parking. Without any prompting from the Applicant, the General Assistant marked and signposted a parking spot in the Infant’s campus car park marked “Principal Parking Only”. Ms Rapone stated that she had felt upset and humiliated when the sign was defaced on several occasions. Words such as “Why? She is never here?” were written on it. She formed the view that a staff member or members was/were responsible for the defacement as the language used was far too sophisticated for a child in the Infant Campus. On each occasion, she had observed teaching staff watching her scrub the graffiti off the sign although no-one offered to assist her and no-one mentioned the matter to her. 
     56 Upon the retirement of the one day per fortnight General Assistant in mid-2002, the Applicant consulted the Principal of Pymble West Public School for his recommendation as to a suitable replacement handyman. He suggested that they share his school's part-time General Assistant, Jose, as he was a good worker. The only drawback was his lack of fluency in the English language. That was not a problem for the Applicant as she was able to communicate with him in his native Spanish supplemented by Italian. That appointment seemed to further increase the tension and unhappiness of the teaching staff at Warrawee. Ms Rapone observed their irritability and resentfulness over the fact that Jose publicly stated that he would only comply with instructions issued to him by ""Miss Lina"" (the Applicant). Mrs McCulloch, the Assistant Principal, had conveyed to her the unhappiness of the staff at what was perceived to be another example of her controlling nature - getting rid of an Australian in favour of a General Assistant who would not comply with their instructions unless they were made through the Principal. Ms Rapone had explained to her on whose recommendation Jose was employed and the fact that Jose, unlike his predecessor who was paid from the school's global budget, was financed by the Department. She had undertaken to set up a maintenance log for the teachers to record precisely what work they needed Jose to carry out. 
     57 Ms Rapone, from approximately mid-2002 onwards, was heavily involved in consultation with the Linkages Consultant at the Ryde District Office of the Department. The latter was working with Warrawee and 5 other local public primary schools to develop programs to facilitate the transition of Year 6 students into high school in the state school system in order to curb the exodus to the private school system. As a result, two programs were developed involving high school students attending the primary schools to provide mentoring and academic support on the study programs. She recalled receiving negative feedback from both Mrs Lyons and Mrs McCulloch claiming that she was wasting her time with the local high schools as most of their students were expected to go on to private schools. 
     58 During Term 1 of 2002, at the request of the school staff and in the belief that it was the most appropriate allocation of resources, she had changed the Warrawee Public School Newsletter from a weekly to a fortnightly publication. At their request, she met with the parents of a Year 2 student to discuss that decision - the mother was a local public school Assistant Principal and the father was the treasurer of the PCA at Warrawee. They considered the move to signify an intention on her part to limit communication with the School community because of her continued involvement, in terms of time and money, with Stewart House. They were angry and questioning of both her professional and personal style and her intentions. The criticism about her ""personal"" style was interpreted by her to be a reference to her sexual orientation. It was entirely unexpected and quite distressing, considering how early that attack came in her first year of occupying the position of Principal. Later, during discussions with her partner, the Applicant emphasised the importance of divorcing her work from her personal life following a comment from her partner that the school community would be unlikely to support their lifestyle. 
     59 The literacy and numeracy statistics which were available from the Department in 2003 revealed that Warrawee Public School was falling behind the District averages in literacy and numeracy, particularly girls numeracy. Ms Rapone formed the view, following an examination of the curriculum, that it was too crowded and decided that Drama, one of the three extra subjects which were funded by the school community, would be dropped and the resources deployed on literature resources. She believed that she had the support of the teaching staff in relation to that initiative. However, she received criticism from a parent who complained that she was introducing too many changes too quickly thereby changing the nature of the school. 
     60 Ms Rapone stated that she received a request in 2003 from Ms Christine Moulds, the Special Education Consultant for the Department, to accommodate extra students in the two additional special education classes required in the District. The School would be provided with additional resources in the form of a Teacher's Aide in the special education class, another Assistant Principal and an increase in funding to purchase resources. Ms Rapone was aware that there was ample evidence that children with special needs and the mainstream children mutually benefit from supported integration and therefore supported the scheme. The effect of her agreement was not only to double the special education resources available at the school but to transition some of the older students who had been in Special Education classes prior to the availability of the new resources into mainstream classes because of the support of the teacher’s aide. The introduction of the additional special education classes was the subject of unfavourable comment at staff meetings. It was generally felt that the School was not an appropriate vehicle for expansion of special education; that it would impact negatively on the educational reputation of the school because of its large numbers of special education students; that the program would take up too much of her time which could be better spent elsewhere; and that the parents were not happy with the increase in special education students into mainstream classes and the resultant lowering of the standard of teaching available to their children. In addition, a parent had accused her of turning Warrawee into a special education school and he did not want his children mixing with them. The response to her initiative was a further reflection of the of the clear divergence of educational values between herself and some of the staff members, as well as herself and the broader Warrawee Public School community of parents. 
     61 In about late 2003, two events occurred which, the Applicant stated, caused her considerable distress and left her emotionally drained. Firstly, she had counselled for at least 6 months a 10-year old student with moderate to severe intellectual disabilities who was severely traumatized because his father committed suicide by hanging in the family home. The close relationship she had developed with that child had been abruptly ended by her removal from the School. Shortly after, Mrs Lawrence's husband had committed suicide in the garage of their home. She had felt impotent and depressed because, despite all her efforts, Mrs Lawrence had rejected all her attempts to provide her with support or assistance. 
     62 The Applicant stated that in addition to all the above stresses, she had personal issues to contend with. She became aware that her partner's mother, who lived in Cairns, was due to retire and could no longer afford secure accommodation. She had volunteered to buy her a unit if it was within her budget. By May 2004 they had settled on a unit in a suburb of Cairns. 
     Alleged Stressors affecting the Applicant on 19 July 200463 The Applicant provided details of the stress conditions she was under on 19 July 2004 involving urgent domestic and work issues which had left her feeling very ""distracted"" and “frazzled”. 
     64 Firstly, a hitch arose in relation to the conveyance of the property in Cairns. Her partner's mother was extremely distressed because it appeared that the settlement date on the unit and the date she was required to vacate the rented premises would not co-incide leaving her with nowhere to live for a short time and the prospect of having to pay for short term accommodation and storage. Her partner was also distressed and crying. If the matter could not be ironed out either Ms Rapone or her partner would have had to travel to Cairns to assist her partner's mother in making alternative arrangements. The Applicant was worried about the emotional state of both women. The Applicant estimated that she had made at least 16 calls during the morning to her partner, her partner's mother, and the real estate agent and Solicitor involved in the conveyance. 
     65 Secondly, she needed to prepare for the professional development program prior to leaving Warrawee at 12 noon for a 12.30 pm start at Gordon East Public School.  
     66 Thirdly, she was Chairperson of the Owner's Corporation and there was a meeting scheduled at 5.30 pm on that day between the Corporation and the Local Council. She had several conversations with a resident in her block of units that morning and was under pressure to deal with the issues he raised in that conversation and to organize the information that she was to put on behalf of the owners at that meeting.  
     The Incident on 19 July 200467 19 July 2004 was the commencement of a new school term. It was a pupil-free day and it was to be used to provide training for the staff. The day's program involved a meeting of Executive Staff between 11.30 am and 12 noon at Warrawee Public School and a teaching workshop commencing at 12.30 pm with staff at Gordon East Public School. Ms Rapone arranged with Mrs McCallum and Mrs Tracy Darby, Assistant Principals, to travel in a convoy with her, as she did not have directions to get to Gordon. 
     68 Ms Rapone stated that at about 12.00 noon she organised the documents she required for the development program. Her mind, she stated, was so preoccupied with the issues described above that she had locked up the building and turned on the alarm, oblivious to the fact that there may have been teachers still within the building. Her actions were indicative of how distracted she was that morning. She had forgotten that there were teaching staff remaining in the Infant’s campus, as well as clerical and other support staff in the Senior campus who may have required access to the premises as well. 
     69 After she got into her car. she stated that she realised that she had left several documents borrowed from the State Office of DET in the staffroom of the Infant's campus. As she needed those documents for the afternoon’s workshop, she alighted from her car, walked over to Mrs McCallum's car and advised her that she needed to return to the staffroom. 
     70 She explained that as she was in a hurry, she had not disengaged the alarm when she re-entered the school building. As she retrieved the documents from the coffee table in the staffroom, she noticed what she described as a small backpack style bag near the documents. She did not know who the bag belonged to other than it must have belonged to a member of the teaching staff as both the Infants and Primary teaching staff had been in the Infant’s staff room for the meeting. Still thinking that she was the last person to leave the building, she decided to pick the bag up and take it over to Gordon East Public School. She returned to her car with the documents and the bag. 
     71 There was conflicting evidence from the Applicant as to when she looked into the bag and discovered the identity of the owner.  
     72 On the way to Gordon East Public School, the Applicant received a telephone call on her mobile telephone from the Senior Clerical Assistant regarding a storage issue. 
     73 That was followed by a telephone call from a teacher, Ms Laura Wigham, who advised her that a handbag belonging to a staff member, Ms Liz Raynor, had been stolen. The Applicant explained that she had not advised Ms Wigham that she had picked up a handbag in the staff room because ""I was at the time I received the telephone call from Ms Wigham feeling quite besieged and distracted"". Some discussion ensued about alerting the Police. There was conflicting evidence as to which one of them undertook the responsibility for calling the Police. Suffice to say the Police were not called by either woman.  
     74 When the teachers arrived at Gordon East Public School, they met over lunch. The Applicant could not recall any conversations with her staff regarding the theft of the bag nor making any sympathetic comments in regards to it. 
     75 The Applicant stated that she had intended to return the handbag to where she found it early the following morning prior to staff arriving at the school. 
     76 At 2.10 pm the Police attended and escorted the Applicant to her car when the handbag was retrieved. At 2.20 pm she was apprehended on a charge of stealing, interviewed and released later that afternoon. 
     The Criminal Proceedings against the Applicant 
     77 Ms Rapone was rearrested and released on 12 August 2004 on suspicion of stealing. 
     78 Finally, on 23 August 2004 Ms Rapone was charged with larceny of a value less than $2000 - to wit a Nokia Mobile phone valued at $150.00, a woman’s purse containing $96.05, a brown suede handbag valued at $30.00, a set of house keys and a set of keys for a new car that were the property of Elizabeth Ann Raynor.  
     79 During the period 08 September 2004 until 03 February 2005, Ms Rapone attended the Hornsby Local Court on five occasions. The hearing on 17 December 2004 before Magistrate Lawson was particularly traumatic. Her relationship with her partner was aired in the presence of parents and staff and their partners from Warrawee Public School. Ms Rapone contended that she heard sniggers and laughter coming from the public gallery throughout the proceedings and also comments such as “it serves her right”, “she’s such a bitch”, and “it’s about time”. 
     80 During the period commencing from 21 December 2004 until 04 February 2005, the matter received press coverage with an article being written for the Manly Daily and the North Shore Times. The local press coverage of the Local Court proceedings, including particulars of the offence charged and the exposure of her lesbian relationship, the Applicant stated, created considerable emotional and psychological difficulties for her and her partner, as they both lived and worked in the local area. 
     81 The Applicant deposed that, to the best of her recollection, no evidence was placed before the Local Court in relation to the circumstances and difficulties she had experienced at Warrawee Public School, nor their impact on her psychological wellbeing, or her psychological state at the time of the incident which led to the criminal charges. 
     82 On 17 January 2005, the charge of larceny in a sum under $2000 was found to be proven. The Applicant was convicted of larceny pursuant to s 117 of the Crimes Act 1900. Honour found stood the matter over for sentencing on 27 January 2005 and later extended it to 03 February 2006 to allow the Applicant an opportunity to put submissions before the Court as to the likely consequences on her career of any sentence which might be imposed. 
     83 On 03 February 2005 Magistrate Lawson dealt with the matter pursuant to s. 10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) by making a finding of guilt but declining to enter a conviction conditional upon Ms Rapone entering into a Good Behaviour Bond for a period of two years. 
     84 Ms Rapone lodged a Notice of Appeal in the District Court against the guilty finding on 04 February 2005, however decided to withdraw it citing extreme emotional and psychological stress as her reason. The Magistrate's original orders were thus confirmed by Judge Berman on 03 March 2005. 
     85 An attempt by the Applicant, by Notice of Motion dated 09 March 2006, to re-instate her Appeal to the District Court was unsuccessful because the Notice of Motion was by then time barred from proceeding. 
     86 The Applicant further attempted, on 12 April and hand-delivered on 18 April 2006, to make an Application for Annulment to the Attorney-General. That application was refused because Lina Rapone was legally represented at the time and had to stand by the decision her counsel made on her behalf not to put her mental state in issue at the hearing. 
     The Respondent's Handling of the Matter 
     87 Ms Rapone stated that her immediate Supervisor, the School Education Director-Ryde, Mr Maurice Brunning, contacted her at her home on 16 September 2004. The Applicant was requested to submit a transfer form as soon as possible in order that the Principal's position at Warrawee would not be vacant at the commencement of the 2005 school year. The Applicant further stated that she had made it clear to him that she was prepared to work in any capacity, anywhere in the State. She had added that she would like to shadow a fellow principal while awaiting her substantive appointment and pointed out that the Principal of Arndell Special School had indicated a willingness for that to happen, subject to departmental approval. Ms Rapone contended that Mr Brunning had promised to investigate whether it would be possible for her to do so. 
     88 On 17 September 2004, the Applicant received correspondence from Mr Brunning advising that her request for an appointment anywhere in the State as principal or in an appropriate executive position in schools or a non school based education teaching service position appropriate to her skills would be progress upon completion of a satisfactory HealthQuest assessment. In the interim, her status would be that of an unattached Primary Principal 3.  
     89 The Applicant contended that the she completed and returned the transfer form attached to which was a letter which stated words to the effect “I am prepared to work anywhere in the State in a school based or non school based position.” 
     90 The Applicant stated that, having received no further communication from the Department, she wrote to Mr Brunning on 18 January 2005 repeating her verbal request for a transfer to her substantive position or placement in a school shadowing a Principal while awaiting such appointment. In doing so, the Applicant had apologised unreservedly for any embarrassment or difficulty she may have caused the Department. She offered an explanation for her preference for work in the metropolitan area but indicated that if the only option was to re-locate then she would do so. She also asked for her request to be forwarded to (Mr Schipp's predecessor) Mr. Jim Ironside, Manager of the Conduct and Efficiency Unit, at the Department , for his advice.  
     91 An emailed response was received on 19 January 2005 in which Mr Brunning advised the Applicant that he had forwarded her letter dated 18 January 2005 to both “EP&C and School Staffing”. 
     92 The Applicant stated that the Department had not provided any information in terms of how it intended to deal with her circumstances nor was any explanation or submission sought from her prior to a determination being made in relation to her continued employment. The correspondence received by her Solicitor from Mr K. Schipp, R/Manager, Staff Efficiency and Conduct Unit, dated 02 February 2005, merely referred her to the relevant disciplinary provisions outlined in Teaching Services Act 1980 (NSW) and the Education Teaching Service Regulation 2001. 
     93 Ms Rapone stated that there had not been any communication to her from the Department from the date of her sentencing, 03 February 2005 until 14 November 2005 except what was initiated by herself. There had not been any indication given to her of what action the Department intended to take, if any. There had not been any request made of her to provide any explanation for the handbag incident. 
     94 Finally, on 24 November 2005 the Applicant received correspondence from Mr Schipp dated 14 November 2005 (it had been forwarded to her previous address). He confirmed the finding of guilt, referred to sections in the Teaching Service Act 1980 as to punishment and penalty, sought an explanation regarding the handbag incident and invited her to provide a written submission as to why a punishment should not be imposed. Ms Rapone acknowledged receipt of that letter on 25 November 2005 and sought an extension of time in which to respond. 
     95 On 05 December 2005 the Applicant provided a 9-page written submission with explanation receipt of which was formally acknowledged by Mr Schipp on 20 December 2005. 
     96 Mr Schipp, in a submission to the Director-General of DEAT, dated 16 February 2006, recommended that the Applicant be given the option to resign voluntarily or be terminated from her employment. That recommendation was adopted. 
     97 Ms Rapone was contacted by her district office and asked to go to Ryde District Office where she was handed correspondence dated 17 February 2006 from Mr Andrew Cappie-Wood, Director-General of the Department of Education and Training, seeking her resignation within 14 days or her employment would be terminated. 
     98 Legal advice and discussions with representatives from the Respondent Department during the period 17 February 2006 to 18 April 2006 confirmed to the Applicant that failure to resign would result in her dismissal. She requested, through correspondence from her Solicitors dated 28 February 2006, an extension by 10 days of the time period provided for her termination in order to investigate means by which she could clear her name. The response from Mr Cappie-Wood, dated 01 March 2006, granted the extension and pointed out that failure to provide her resignation within 10 days from that date would result in her dismissal become effective from the end date of the extension.99 On 09 March 2006, the Applicant filed a Notice of Motion and an Affidavit in support of the Motion in the District Court of New South Wales seeking that the Appeal be reinstated. 
     100 Ms Rapone stated that her Solicitor advised her that the Motion was dismissed on 21 March 2006. The 3-month limitation period applied to the filing of her Appeal and hence she was time barred from pursuing it. 
     101 The Applicant pointed out that she had provided long and dedicated service to the Department. She has had a long term commitment to the needs of disadvantaged and disabled students. She had no prospects of obtaining any work with the Department or as a consultant with any organization that provides services to the Department having been terminated by the Department and placed on the Departmental “blacklist”. It was her belief that such a ""blacklisting"" would also preclude her from serving on Boards of not-for-profit charitable organizations providing educational services. 
     102 The Applicant referred to second paragraph of the HealthQuest Report dated 29 September 2004 under the heading “Document Review”. She categorically stated that other than the incident on 19 July 2004 she had never been charged with the theft of any item either during the course of her employment or otherwise. She further stated that no member of staff at Warrawee Public School had ever raised any of the issues or allegations of theft with her in any way whatsoever or at any time during her employment at Warrawee Public School. In addition, no-one from the Department had ever raised any of those allegations with her. She emphatically denied that she had taken any items whatsoever that did not belong to her from Warrawee Public School or any school she had been employed in during the course of her employment by the Department. She had never been provided by the Department with an opportunity to respond to any of the allegations contained in the HealthQuest Report dated 29 September 2004.Expert Evidence on behalf of the Applicant103 Mr Timothy Matrell Watson-Munro, consultant forensic psychologist, gave an account of certain facts and circumstances in his report drawn from what he had been told, particularly by Ms Rapone. 
     104 During cross-examination, he agreed that it would be common in making a report of that kind that he would rely primarily upon what he was told by the person consulting him of the facts that led to the particular circumstance he was required to look into. He stated, however, that he had also relied on copies of correspondence he had been supplied with, the transcript of the Local Court proceedings and the psychological report of Ms Zanberg amongst other things. 
     105 He stated that during the course of his conferences with Ms Rapone, she recognised her wrongdoing, she recognised that what she had done was inappropriate and she was very sorry for that. 
     106 In his report, he stated that notwithstanding the conviction, there was nothing from his detailed assessment to suggest that individuals innately are predisposed towards criminal activity. He then went on to say that advisedly based on what he was able to say and know, including her prior career, there was no indication of criminal matters in her past, she seemed to be an extremely dedicated teacher who took on an enormous amount of responsibility in terms of her career and her care for others. He agreed, during cross-examination, that he had relied upon her making full disclosure to him in forming a view of that kind. 
     107 She had disclosed to him, and it was also in the documentation, the fact that there had been allegations, which did not result in any charges, of her having taken property (a camera and some wine glasses) belonging to other teachers from her school. He had also taken that into account in forming the view he formed. 
     108 Ms Nell Zanberg, a clinical and consultative psychologist, who used to be a working colleague of the Applicant at one stage, tendered a report dated 30 April 2006 which had been prepared for the purposes of an application to the Attorney-General for the annulment of the conviction of Ms Rapone in the Local Court in relation to a larceny matter.  
     109 Ms Zanberg stated that prior to preparing her report, she had held some conferences with Ms Rapone and with Ms Rapone's Solicitors. She had also been provided with a document written by Ms Rapone and the Manly Daily articles on the Local Court proceedings. 
     110 She explained that in her report she had endeavoured to lay down a psychological context for the incident post the event. She agreed that she had not tried to analyse why the Applicant took the handbag because her report was prepared for the purpose of attaching it to the Applicant's comprehensive annulment application to the Attorney-General and that application had detailed everything that had preceded the incident. 
     THE RESPONDENT'S EVIDENCE111 Mr Schipp stated that he was appointed Manager, Staff Efficiency and Conduct, Employee Performance and Conduct (EPAC) with the NSW Department of Education and Training in April 2005, having acted in that position since January 2005. He previously held positions of classroom teacher and Deputy Principal. 
     112 The Staff Efficiency and Conduct (SEC) team manages conduct and efficiency matters in relation to staff employed by DET.  
     113 Mr Schipp gave evidence that the Department has approximately 120,000 persons on its payroll of whom approximately 55,000 were permanent teachers and 1000 were engaged in a policy capacity. 
     114 In the performance of his current role, Mr Schipp has access to the Department’s records and has drawn on those records in making his statement. 
     115 Mr Schipp acknowledged that there were four HealthQuest reports albeit he had only seen two at the time he prepared his submission and recommendation to the Director-General - the assessments undertaken by Dr Walker dated 29 September 2004 and Dr Stambouliah dated 17 May 2005. He pointed out that he could not detect any comment in either of the two assessments he had read that indicated that Ms Rapone's action on that day was related to a medical condition. If there had been such a link, it may well have altered the recommendation he made to the Director-General. 
     116 Whilst Mr Schipp was in agreement that teaching in the environment described by the Applicant could give rise to highly stressful circumstances, he pointed out that prior to the incident of 19 July 2004, there had not been a scintilla of a suggestion that there had been any difficulties on Ms Rapone's part in coping with those senior and demanding jobs within the Department. 
     117 As Mr Schipp had not seen the second assessment, dated 02 February 2005, undertaken by Dr Stambouliah on 19 October 2004, its contents did not form part of the material he had given consideration to in terms of preparing his submissions to the Director-General. He admitted that he had never been aware of that specific recommendation regarding provision of alternative duties and therefore had not forwarded that information to the Director-General. He agreed, during cross-examination, that the task required that all material that could fairly and properly have been expected to influence the decision maker should have been put before the decision maker. He agreed that his role was one of objectivity in relation to the preparation of his submissions. He pointed out, however, that the Director-General would have been aware of the recommendation in that report as a copy had been included in Ms Rapone's submission to him. 
     118 The HealthQuest Report dated 17 May 2005 recommended that a trial return to work. During cross-examination, Mr Schipp stated that the responsible officer for implementing or rejecting that recommendation would have been the Regional Director upon advisement by himself. The Department's view was that, considering the seriousness of the charges against her, it would not be appropriate to accept that recommendation. He denied that the conviction for theft was the sole determinant regarding her future with the Department, albeit he considered it would be inappropriate to return her to a school having regard to the nature of the offence: 
      
       
        
        ""I found it difficult to believe that a principal of 32 years experience, whose stressful day included the fact she was having a meeting that afternoon and that her partner's mother was having trouble arranging rental accommodation, that that was the cause of such stress that she stole a colleague's handbag... They were the issues that she raised on the day of the 19th in her response to me.... I found it implausible that that was the cause of the reason for her stealing of a purse..... Can I say to you that's the reason I gave the recommendation to resign. I believe there has been irretrievable breakdown in the relationship... I think she's had an irretrievable breakdown with the staff of her school, I think she's had an irretrievable breakdown with the Department in the sense of our expectation of a principal."" 
        
       
     119 Mr Schipp accepted that the recommendation from Dr Stambouliah had not specified a return to work in any particular capacity. However, he disagreed with the proposition that it was open, on any reasonable interpretation of that recommendation, to consider work as a teacher, or in an administrative capacity. He rejected the proposition that consideration could have been given to returning her to work as a teacher under supervision pointing out that the recommendation had gone on to add that her performance could be monitored for at least six months. He questioned the feasibility of monitoring a principal who has been returned to a school as a classroom teacher. His interpretation of the recommendation would be a return to work in the person's substantive position. For that reason, the Respondent sought a final review of Ms Rapone by Dr Walker to determine her fitness to continue employment as a Principal. 
     120 Mr Schipp had included in his submission to the Director-General the HealthQuest recommendation of 17 May 2005 that she be returned to work on a trial basis at a school other than Warrawee. He agreed, however, that he had not indicated that the recommendation had not been implemented. He was of the view that such matter was irrelevant to the decision the Director-General had to make. 
     121 Although he had mentioned in his submissions to the Director-General that Ms Rapone was to be provided with further testing as there were serious concerns about her health, he agreed that he had not:· referred to the fact that there were psychiatric or psychological issues identified in relation to the Applicant; nor· annexed any of the HealthQuest reports to his submissions; nor· indicated that the HealthQuest assessment he referred to of 15 September 2004 was prepared by a psychiatrist, nor· drawn attention to the fact that Dr Walker had identified errors in cognitive testing; had referred to her unblemished teaching record, or his conclusion that her recent behaviour was out of character and defied logical explanation. 
      
      He held the view that those matters were not relevant to the decision that had to be made. 
       
     122 Mr Schipp stated that attempts had been made to gather all relevant information concerning Ms Rapone prior to a recommendation being made to the Director-General:· His Department had written to the Registrar of the Local Court about the status of the matter and received a response dated 04 November 2005 advising that an appeal had been lodged to the District Court and subsequently withdrawn;· On 10 January 2006, his Department had requested copies of any pre-sentence reports and transcripts of the proceedings from the Registrar of the Local Court. A delay was experienced as, ultimately, those documents had to be obtained from the District Court; and· A request was made, on 15 February 2006, pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, for a copy of the Police Brief of Evidence in the matter. A determination was made by NSW Police Legal Services on 26 April 2006 to decline that request. 
     123 He conceded, however, that no contact had been made with Ms Rapone in order to discuss the issues with her but explained that he did not consider it appropriate to address the matter of the court proceedings with her while she was, firstly, unfit for duty, and secondly, on approved leave. 
     124 He also conceded that up until 16 February 2006 when he made his recommendation to the Director-General, he had made no attempts to contact Ryde Regional Office to request any relevant material held in relation to Ms Rapone. Therefore, as a result of an administrative oversight, he had not been provided with a copy of Dr Stambuliah's report of 02 February 2005 in relation to the October 2004 assessment. 
     125 Mr Schipp pointed out, on his own behalf, that he had neither expressly included nor deliberately excluded any matters raised in the HealthQuest Reports from his submission to the Director-General. He had read those reports and merely summarised them for the Director-General: 
      
       
        
        ""... Both of the HealthQuest determinations that I've read, in my opinion, one of the things we may well have been looking for in those was a link between her conduct and some medical condition. My view of the matter was that after reading both those HealthQuest determinations in detail, neither of them gave a link between her actions in July of stealing the handbag of a staff member and the information which was availed in that HealthQuest determination. Now, if we had received in those HealthQuest determinations, for example, clear links between her conduct and a medical condition, then we may well have been looking at medical retirement. However, the final HealthQuest determination which I received in May 2005 - and I'm aware now that there was one after that - clearly indicated that she was fit to resume duty now.... there's no statement in there that those conditions were prevailing or not prevailing at the time of the offence."" 
        
       
     126 Mr Schipp further conceded that, until he was shown a copy during cross-examination, had not been aware of the letter from the Applicant to Maurice Brunning dated 18 January 2005, in which the Applicant had stated: 
      
       
        
        ""I have mentioned to you before that apart from willing to be placed almost anywhere, I am also prepared to accept some sort of probationary status if that is warranted. I'm prepared to be under direct supervision of any other colleague. Whatever the Department deems appropriate, I am prepared to comply with in order to return to work."" 
        
       
     127 It was pointed out to Mr Schipp that, in his report to the Director-General, he had, immediately upon advising that Ms Rapone had been found guilty of stealing a handbag, went on to make reference to the fact that, ""There had been other instances of staff members possessions being taken"". He disagreed with the suggestion that that he was attempting to convey a very clear inference that Ms Rapone had been guilty of taking other staff members' possessions as well. Mr Schipp confirmed that the Applicant had not been charged in relation to any other matter. He further confirmed that the Department had never raised with her any other allegations of theft attributed to her and hence she was never given any opportunity to respond to any such allegations. He accepted that, once he had adverted to the other thefts, the proper and necessary course would have been to have drawn to the Director-General's attention that no charges had been made in relation to those matters, that she had vigorously denied any such allegations and that they had not been raised with her by the Department. 
     128 Mr Schipp agreed that Ms Rapone's work history with the department is a material matter when considering the exercise of the discretions pursuant to ss 85 and 86 of the Act. He pointed out that he was familiar with Ms Rapone's work history with the department but that he had not considered her educational background in great detail. He agreed with the proposition that, in relation to her professional teaching career, her academic qualifications and the seniority of the positions she has held, she was quite clearly a person of very senior level qualifications and experience in the Department. 
     129 Mr Schipp stated that he had considered Ms Rapone’s extended and good service to the Department. If it had not been for that, his recommendation would have been that she be dismissed. Directing Ms Rapone to resign was intended to permit her to leave the Department with dignity. 
     130 Mr Schipp explained, during cross-examination, that the reasons why Ms Rapone could not be returned to work were the fact that, firstly, there was no vacancy for a principal and, secondly, she had been found guilty of a highly serious matter. 
     131 Mr Schipp stated his submission to the Director-General of DET recommended that the appropriate punishment under s 85 of the Act would be for her to be directed to resign under s 85 (1)(b)(i). Her name would be placed on the list of persons not to be employed in any capacity in NSW government schools and colleges without reference to the Director of Staffing Services. 
     132 In coming to the view that it was the appropriate course to recommend to the Director-General, he had regard to Section 86 of the Teaching Service Act; the seriousness of the charge of which she had been found guilty; the position of trust in which employees, particularly senior employees, hold in the Department; the Department’s principles on leadership; and its duty of care to employees and students. 
      
       
        
       
     133 On 27 March 2006 solicitors for Ms Rapone wrote to the Director-General informing him that the appeal in the District Court had been unsuccessful but that Ms Rapone would be making an application for annulment to the Attorney-General in respect of the matter. 
     134 Mr Schipp stated that a recommendation was issued from his Department, on 03 April 2006 to the Director-General that notwithstanding the proposed application to the Attorney-General, Ms Rapone should be required to resign within 7 days. The Director-General wrote to solicitors for Ms Rapone in those terms on 05 April 2006. 
     135 A response dated 12 April 2006 was received from solicitors for Mr Rapone addressed to the Director-General seeking a further extension of time on the basis that Ms Rapone was applying to the Attorney-General pursuant to s 5 of the Crimes (Local Courts Appeal and Review) Act 2001 for an annulment of her conviction. A copy of the Applicant's application to the Attorney-General for annulment was forwarded to the Director-General on 18 April 2006.  
     136 Mr Schipp's department wrote to the Director-General on 19 April 2006 recommending action under s 85 (3) of the TSA following Ms Rapone's failure to submit her resignation following direction to do so. 
     137 The Director-General exercised his power under the Teaching Service Act 1980 to dismiss Ms Rapone in correspondence dated 20 April, 2006. Rejection of the request for an extension of time and confirmation of her dismissal was forwarded to the solicitors for the Applicant on the same day by the General Manager, Industrial Relations and Employment Services for the Department. Mr Schipp subsequently became aware that the Attorney-General’s Department had declined Ms Rapone’s request for an annulment of her conviction. 
     138 Mr Schipp concluded in his statement that, in his view, the actions of the Director-General were reasonable and appropriate, taking into account the expectations required of Principals as outlined in various the Departmental manuals - the Code of Conduct, Leading and Managing the School, School Leadership Capability Framework and Values in NSW Public Schools: March 2004. 
     Submissions139 The submission on behalf of the Applicant is summarised below.140 The dismissal of the Applicant was patently clearly harsh, unreasonable and unjust.141 A great deal of the material in the Applicant's substantial affidavit had not been factually contested and therefore there was not a great deal of contested evidence in this matter.142 Regard must be had to the contribution that the Applicant can continue to make to some very disadvantaged students who are deprived of the advantages routinely available in ordinary schools. The Applicant has devoted approximately 30 years of her life to establishing a very successful career as a teacher. In particular, attention was drawn to what can be described as more than a substantial contribution and personal commitment to the educational needs of very disadvantaged and very dysfunctional young people in New South Wales. In that regard, she has not only obtained two post graduate qualifications and overseas experience in that field, she has held very high level and responsible positions in both educational institutions, institutions for persons from disadvantaged backgrounds who have been through the criminal justice system (for example, Minda and Yasmar), in educational facilities designed specifically to cater for the educational needs of disadvantaged students, and in the high level management roles (for example, as CEO of Stewart House). 143 One of the issues the Director-General was asked to consider in determining an appropriate penalty was the likelihood of a recurrence of the conduct on 19 July 2004. It was submitted that a proper foundation for that conclusion in terms of the matters that were positive towards Ms Rapone was not made. 
     144 It was submitted that a highly relevant consideration in that regard is the concession made by Mr Schipp during cross-examination that her role as Principal in such establishments had been both challenging and stressful having regard to the type of students whose needs were being catered for. On that basis, it must be concluded that, across the entirety of her career, except for one day in July 2004, there was never a scintilla of problem in relation to her ability to deal with the stresses involved in her role as Principal. That material fact, it was emphasised, had not been drawn to his attention. 
     145 Mr Schipp agreed that his role was to put relevant material to the Director-General that was reasonably and objectively capable of affecting the approach he took to where the matter should fall in terms of the disciplinary spectrum that was available to him. It was submitted that the evidence before the Commission compels the conclusion that Mr Schipp's submission put to the Director-General excluded some of that material - namely, in relation to her general wellbeing, the positive aspects of the criminal proceedings before the Magistrate, and her contribution to the Department.  
     146 In relation to her general wellbeing, there was no identification in the report to the Director-General of the existence of mental and psychological problems at the time. Firstly, two HealthQuest reports indicated a cognitive dysfunction on the applicant's behalf. There was no evidence that there was any limitation in time in relation to them. The first Report of Mr Stambouliah indicated a mild but significant cognitive impairment, significant difficulties in attention, concentration, memory and organisation. Mr Schipp conceded, under cross- examination, that there was nothing in the material that he looked at that allowed any conclusion that those cognitive deficits were not prevalent at the time the offence was committed. The failure to identify or draw to attention to those reports in the submission to the Director-General, or identify that they were prepared by a psychologist or psychiatrist or even indicate those findings to him was therefore inexplicable and entirely unfair to the Applicant. It was concluded that such failure fundamentally procedurally flawed the process that occurred. It fundamentally and must necessarily have impaired the approach of the decision maker to place this matter on the spectrum or the range of disciplinary measures that were available. 
     147 Secondly, in her correspondence to Mr Schipp dated 05 December 2005, Ms Rapone had detailed the stressors she had experienced on 19 July 2005 and clearly linked them with a detailed history of the difficulties she had been experiencing as Principal at Warrawee Public School. She explained that she had been upset and emotional on that day and was not acting rationally. Dr Walker had noted that her conduct defied logical explanation and that she had been distracted on 19 July. Further, Dr Stambouliah had identified difficulties in memory, concentration, organisation and attention. The press clippings vouch for the fact that she had been subjected to enormous pressure and stress, apart from what one would ordinarily expect to be experienced when one is a defendant in criminal proceedings. It was submitted that Ms Rapone presented as a highly credible and truthful witness despite slight inconsistencies between her evidence in these proceedings and the police reports which were understandable in the circumstances described above. 
     148 Thirdly, it was pointed out that there was little challenge made to the conclusions drawn by both Nell Zanberg and Tim Watson-Munro that the Applicant was suffering from a depressive illness. Attention was drawn to the Ms Zanberg's conclusions, ""It is my professional opinion after reviewing the documents, that her level of stress increased steadily over the 2.5 years, causing her to become clinically depressed. It is this depression and related anxiety state that accounted for her inability to relate the reasons for taking the purse"". In a more substantive assessment, specifically prepared for these proceedings, Mr Watson-Munro stated that ""Ms Rapone expressed profound regret for what occurred"", and diagnosed her as ""suffering a severe anxiety disorder with strong features of intermittent depression and anxiety according to DSM4 criteria"". He strongly suspected that her out-of character series of behaviours and actions on the day of the offence were because she had experienced a psychological decompensation with associated features of panic. 
     149 In relation to the proceedings before the Magistrate, it was submitted that if the Director-General's attention was to be drawn to the adverse aspects of the Magistrate's decision, then it follows that attention would also be drawn to any positive comments that may have been made. Although Mr Schipp gave evidence that he had read those positive comments, he had failed to either draw attention to the magistrate's view that the offence was not of a serious nature; or drawn attention to the fact that the case had received special consideration from the norm and for that reason a section 10 conviction had been entered; or captured the nature of her commitment to the Department by the provision of a proper and fair presentation of her work history.  
     150 In relation to her commitment to the Department, the submission to the Director-General contained no identification of her long and successful history of dealing with stressful school environments. 
     151 The Applicant did not accept that Mr Schipp, in his submission to the Director-General, did not intend any inference to arise from the manner in which he had identified the conviction and then proceeded to refer to other instances of theft occurring at the school. It was submitted that the logical, sensible construction of that paragraph leads inexorably to the conclusion that there was an ongoing pattern of theft and only the Applicant was implicated in it. In conclusion, it was submitted that Mr Schipp had taken a negative view of the applicant's actions and to that end, he omitted to take any opportunity to put any material favourable to Ms Rapone's circumstances or put extenuating circumstances to the Director-General. Instead, he selected material that supported his view and presented it in such a form that there was really little discretion available to the Director-General. 
     152 It was submitted on behalf of the Applicant that the circumstances warrant a clear and unequivocal finding that her dismissal was harsh, unjust and unfair and she ought to have her job back and she ought to be compensated for the time she has been out of work. Ms Rapone's gave evidence she would accept any position in a teaching or non-teaching role, as principal, as teacher, subject to any level of supervision and in any part of the State. There is no impediment to reinstatement other than the incident on 19 July 2004. She has a great deal to contribute, particularly to disadvantaged students. It was submitted that the Act provides the scope to accommodate her request. 
     153 In the alternative, she is entitled to compensation for the dismissal on the grounds that it was unfair. 
     154 The submission on behalf of the Respondent is summarised below. 
     155 The onus is entirely upon the Applicant to persuade the Commission to intervene in the dismissal.  
     156 The starting point for the Commission's assessment of the fairness or otherwise of the dismissal was the matrix upon which the Department based its decision to terminate the applicant. The Department considered the contractual obligations placed upon teachers in . Firstly, in a statement of key accountabilities for Principals titled ""Leading and Managing of the School""; secondly, in the Department's Code of Conduct; and, thirdly, the Teaching Service Act all of which capture exactly the sort of conduct which is the subject of these proceedings. 
     157 It was noted that the Commission was assured by Ms Rapone that she was very familiar with those materials. She was a role model and was obliged to demonstrate probity and leadership standards.  
     158 It was pointed out that the Department owed a duty of care to all of its students as well its employees, including Liz Raynor, whose handbag Ms Rapone had stolen.  
     159 It was not in dispute that the Director-General has a range of disciplinary measures available to him pursuant to the Teaching Service Act, including a power to dismiss employees in circumstances where they commit criminal conduct. The mere fact that there is a range of disciplinary measures available does not detract from the statutory obligation to dismiss an employee in certain circumstances. 
     160 Nevertheless, in view of her long-standing record and service to the Department, and in order to provide her with an opportunity to depart with dignity and a clean record, the Applicant was given an opportunity, which she declined, to resign her employment. 
     161 Procedural fairness had been afforded the Applicant in that she was given an opportunity to make submissions about the offence and the penalty. 
     162 Mr Schipp had provided, as was required of him, an objective, balanced submission to the Director-General in which he made some broad but balanced statements. He had attached to his submission Ms Rapone's 20-page document in which the Applicant had advanced her own interest commencing with the following preamble, ""I deliberated over every word to ensure my response is considered, measured and appropriate"".  
     163 The HealthQuest Reports, it was suggested, had no bearing on the criminal action taken by the Applicant nor do their contents suggest any link between the criminal action and any kind of condition that she exhibited. It therefore did not matter whether copies of those reports were or were not forwarded to the Director-General. Mr Schipp gave evidence that if any of the Doctors had suggested there was such a link, then he would have considered the matter in a different light and there might have been a different outcome. 
     164 The Commission has before it a School Principal, in a position of high trust, who intentionally stole the personal handbag of a fellow teacher and kept it with the intention of depriving the owner of it. The Department was required to consider how it can accommodate within its duty of care to staff and students, the maintenance within the system of a person who, in grave breach of the trust placed in her as a senior employee, stoles another person's handbag. The Department considered that her action warranted termination. Nevertheless, she was offered the opportunity to resign or ultimately be terminated. 
     165 Ms Rapone had a fundamental problem in that on the one hand she wanted to cavil with the Respondent's decision to dismiss her and, on the other hand, she had not, at any time, openly accepted that she had intentionally stolen Ms Raynor's handbag. Despite the Court's ruling, she refused to concede it during consultations with Mr Watson-Munro, Ms Zanberg and while giving oral evidence in these proceedings. 
     166 Her refusal to concede that it was a theft and that it was intentional, it was submitted, has two effects. Firstly, there was no contrition for her wrongdoing. Secondly the Applicant shifted the blame for the theft on to stress. Whilst it was conceded that the role of a School Principal would be stressful, it was pointed out that the role of every policy maker would also be stressful. It was concluded that if stress leads to thievery then that person is not suited for employment as either a School Teacher or a School Principal. In addition, the Applicant, when questioned as to whether she could guarantee that she would not re-offend, responded that she could not answer that question.  
     167 In conclusion, the legislation requires the Director-General to exercise his discretion in disciplinary matters and the Respondent was of the belief that the discretion was correctly exercised and, even if it has not, the Applicant cannot be returned to employment in light of the above. 
     168 The Responded cited Wang and Ors v. Crestell Industries Pty Ltd and ano. (Cahill VP, Hill J and French C) as authority in support of its contention that the seriousness of Ms Rapone's misconduct far outweighed any lack of procedural fairness which may have been involved in her dismissal and therefore the latter did not render her dismissal harsh, unreasonable or unjust. In Ms Rapone's case, she had not been completely deprived of the opportunity to put a case to the Director-General. 
     169 If, however, the Commission was to find that, notwithstanding all of the above, the dismissal was harsh, unreasonable or unjust, then in determining what remedy to award consideration should be given to a number of factors. Firstly, the demeanour of the Applicant who was not contrite about the actual theft either at the point of dismissal or in proceedings before the Commission. She refused to admit that it occurred, told the Local Court that she hid the handbag from view of the public to protect it from theft yet told the Police that she hid it until she could sneak it back unnoticed into the School. Secondly, it would not be possible to restore her to the workplace in the absence of trust. It was theft that caused the employment relationship to be severed and the Applicant cannot say that such a thing would not recur. It was submitted that the neither the Department nor her colleagues can trust her. Even the Applicant had no answer to give when her Counsel asked her how she would deal with a situation where she was restored to the workplace with the taint of being guilty. Thirdly, whilst not discounting the Applicant's contribution towards disadvantaged students and whilst the Department did not make the decision to part with an experienced and valued teacher lightly, it took into account its obligations towards both staff and students, including disadvantaged students, in arriving at its decision to terminate the Applicant. The Department has other staff with similar skills and there is no evidence that the students are being disadvantaged as a result of that decision. 
     170 If the Commission was minded to award compensation, then it is obliged to have regard to mitigation and the modest rewards the Applicant's new business venture has had. 
     171 In summary, it was emphasised that the Applicant, who was in a high position of trust, breached that trust by an act that struck at the heart of the contractual relationship between the parties. She stole a subordinate employee's handbag which contained property of a kind that would put that person in a state of fear. The explanation she provided for an act that warrants dismissal was unsatisfactory. Nevertheless, because of her good record, she was given an opportunity to resign which she spurned. The decision to dismiss her was thus carried fairly and properly and the Commission ought not intervene to alter it. 
     172 In reply, it was submitted on behalf of the Applicant that the HealthQuest reports were specifically addressing her fitness to return to work. None of the HealthQuest reports were requested to identify any link or were prepared for any apparent forensic purpose.  
     173 Finally, it was submitted that the Industrial Commission in a section 84 claim is performing a different task to a Local Court in a criminal proceeding. The Commission is entitled to form its own view of the seriousness of the offence and of any mitigating or extenuating circumstances. 
     CONSIDERATION174 The starting point for consideration of the matter is the fact that, on the criminal standard applied in the Local Court, Ms Rapone was found to be guilty of larceny.  
     175 A person convicted of larceny would, pursuant to the provisions of s 117 of the Crimes Act 1900, ordinarily expect to be imprisoned for five years. 
     176 In response to a request for the Court to exercise its discretion and make an order for dismissal pursuant to s 10, his Honour pointed out that it would have been a conventional and totally predictable outcome had Ms Rapone pleaded guilty to the offence. He further pointed out that its use was inappropriate in a case where there has been a plea of not guilty and where the evidence given by the accused on a contest on the facts has not been accepted. 177 Nevertheless, notwithstanding the general rule, his Honour noted that the section was ""clearly intended to be used to intervene in cases where a penalty disproportionate to the offence would be visited on an accused through the fact of conviction"".178 Therefore, in considering what sentence to impose on the applicant, Magistrate Lawson sought information as to the likely ramifications of a conviction on her continued employment: 
      
       
        
        ""....The offence the accused has been convicted of was a not insignificant offence,  
        but it was far from what could be called serious 
        . The consequences for the accused have I am convinced been very serious indeed, some of them have been referred to in Court today. They have included a degree of publicity, the loss of her position at Warrawee Public School and it seems unlikely that that position will be regained, the uncertainty of her career in the public teaching profession in the future, and clear difficulty with obtaining comparable or even substantially downgraded employment in teaching otherwise. These are severe consequences. I think in the circumstances it would be not appropriate that they should be added to by the recording of a conviction in the present case..."" [emphasis added] 
        
       
     179 It is obvious from the above, that his Honour had taken into account the fact that she had lost her position at Warrawee Public School and the uncertainty of her future within the public teaching profession in deciding to exercise the discretion to apply s. 10 notwithstanding the Applicant's not guilty plea. 
     180 I accept the explanation advanced by the Applicant for withdrawing her appeal to the District Court. 
     181 It is interesting to note that there is absolutely no evidence that the Applicant had complained to anyone or sought assistance from the Department in relation to the problems she had experienced at Warrawee Public School from commencement there in January 2002 until her first HealthQuest assessment on 15 September 2004.  
     182 It is equally interesting to note that despite the emotions and the stressors she had described, which it is fair to say, would have been exacerbated by the Police apprehending her in front of staff on 19 July 2004, re-arresting her the following month and charging her with larceny, Ms Rapone did not seek any assistance, medical or otherwise. It was at the behest of the Department that she completed a sick leave application form and it was also at the behest of the Department that she consulted HealthQuest. 
     183 No attempt was made to tender any of the available HealthQuest Reports to the Local Court. I accept the submission of the Respondent that the HealthQuest reports do not address the incident on 19 July 2004.  
     184 The HealthQuest Reports, as well as the Applicant's expert witnesses, can only attest to what the Applicant has divulged during private consultation.  
     185 There was no evidence whatsoever before the Commission that the Applicant's sexual preference had anything to do with the problems she encountered in the two years leading up to the incident or on the day of the incident. 186 The Applicant stated that she was aware of the Department's expectations placed on Principals as stipulated in the document, “Leading and Managing a School”, a statement of key accountabilities for Principals, which states: 
      
       
        
         
        The principal occupies the pivotal position in the school and is accountable for leadership and management consistent with relevant State legislation and the policies and priorities of the NSW Government. The task is complex and requires the principal to be the leading learner in the school, and a role model to staff and the community. 
        
       
     187 She also confirmed that she was aware of the Department's Code of Conduct which states, inter alia, that:  
      
       
        
        4.1 The Department is committed to the highest standards of conduct in public education, training and administration. To meet this commitment, the Department has issued this single Code of Conduct to cover all departmental sectors and to more closely align staff conduct with the organisational values and ethics which underpin the Department's policies and procedures. 
        
       
      
      
       
        
        16.9 Staff should be aware that unlawful or unprofessional conduct, even in a private capacity, which damages the reputation of the Department, may require disciplinary action by the Department. 
        
       
     188 In relation to a ministerial statement issued in March 2004 titled, “Values in NSW Public Schools”, setting out some core values which the Minister deemed to be core values for the operation of the Department and those within it, Ms Rapone stated that she was very familiar with those core values as they reflected her sentiments exactly. She accepted being judged and assessed against those values and those responsibilities.189 She agreed that principals are expected to be role models within schools and within the community and that leaders are required to “maintain commitment to ethical values and professional practice at all times”.190 She further agreed that to intentionally steal a subordinate teacher’s personal handbag is completely and utterly at variance with those values and those responsibilities. She accepted that the Department has always had an entitlement to require her to abide by its Code of Conduct and if she were to be reinstated or re-employed in any capacity she would still be bound to abide by that Code.191 Mr Newall referred to lack of contrition by the Applicant. The Applicant, throughout the current proceedings laid the blame directly on the stressful situation she found herself in on 19 July 2004. There was only one mention of the fact that the Applicant had shown remorse and that was in the interview with Mr Watson-Munro. 
     192 Having said all that, the Applicant, it cannot be denied, has a remarkable and distinguished career in the teaching field. Her energy appears to be boundless in relation to her need for learning as well as the need to assist in the area of the disadvantaged. One cannot cavil with Mr Schipp's evidence that there are other staff within the Teaching Department that have similar qualifications and experience but I doubt very much if there would be a very high percentage of staff in that group. 
     193 I accept that in normal circumstances one would feel inclined to pick up the handbag for the purpose of safekeeping if they are the last to leave the premises. However, notwithstanding medical assessments by HealthQuest and two hearings (one on the criminal standard and another on the civil standard), the enigma remains unresolved - why did the Applicant not divulge to anyone that she had the handbag? What would prompt a teacher to snoop around Ms Rapone's car until she detected the bag? 
     194 Notwithstanding that, the Commission has grave concerns about the submission made to the Director-General. The onus is on the Department to put processes in place to ensure that all relevant documentation is available to it when preparing a submission such as this. It is not enough to say that the Applicant had provided a 20-page submission herself which he is likely to read.  
     195 In addition to that, both positive and negative aspects need to be put to the Director-General so that the submission may be objective. I accept that it is a very difficult task indeed for someone to adopt an objective approach in a case involving someone from their own Department but justice has to be done. There were many positive features to the Applicant's case which were not suitably presented. 
     196 Of particular concern was the manner in which other alleged thefts were mentioned but not clarified leading the Director-General or anyone else reading the submission to make certain negative inferences about the Applicant. 
     197 Having regard to all of the above, I find that the dismissal of the Applicant was harsh as another lesser penalty could have been imposed. 
     198 Having said that, it is of grave concern to me and unfortunate for the Applicant that she was unable to provide a more positive response to a direct question from Mr Newall about her future behaviour: 
      
       
        
        Newall: Q. Under similar stresses of course, that could happen again, couldn’t it? You have no way of saying otherwise, have you? 
         
        Rapone: A. I have no way of answering that question, yes. 
        
       
     199 There was a similar vague response in relation to a return to work and how she would interact with other staff.200 If the Commission was to accept stress was the ultimate cause of her problem, it is noted that the Applicant agreed during cross-examination that being a teacher is a very stressful job and being a school principal is an even more stressful job. She also agreed that there is a significant degree of responsibility on classroom teachers and a greater degree of responsibility on school leadership position holders. Those stresses are the same today, if not more, than were present on 19 July 2004. 
     201 As the Applicant cannot guarantee to the Commission that similar behaviour would not occur if she were returned to work, the only relief is compensation. I note that the Applicant has commenced a small business enterprise and details of that were provided on the record. I further note that she was off work with pay for various reasons until a short time prior to her termination. On that basis, the Applicant is awarded compensation of six weeks' pay calculated on the weekly rate she received averaged over the last six months she was in employment. 
     202 The Applicant has completed her two year good behaviour bond without, it would seem any mishap. She has done her penance. I would strongly recommend to the Respondent that, if at some future date, the Applicant is able to provide medical or other evidence to the effect that she is fit to resume duties as a teacher, that strong consideration be given to utilising her skills and devotion within the public teaching system. 
     ORDER203 The Respondent is to pay to the Applicant a sum equivalent to six weeks' pay calculated at the weekly rate of pay averaged over the last six months of her employment;204 The payment is to be made within 21 days of today's date.205 These proceedings are hereby concluded.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
       
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with Hislop J. 
     
      
    2 HULME J: I agree with the orders proposed by Hislop J and with his Honour’s reasons. I would add the following. 
     
      
    3 The material before the Court persuades me that a combination of his sentence and the psychiatric condition which has supervened since, means that in consequence of his offence the Applicant has suffered far, far more than any punishment his offence deserved. The case is one which merits serious consideration by the executive government pursuant to the powers referred to in R v Munday (1981) 2 NSWLR 177 at 178 and, following the dismissal of this appeal, urgent such attention. 
     
      
    4 HISLOP J: The applicant was charged on indictment on the following counts:  
     
      
       
        
        Count (1) attempt to obtain money by deception contrary to the  
        Crimes Act 
         1900 s178BA(1). The maximum penalty for such an offence is imprisonment for 5 years when dealt with on indictment or 2 years if dealt with summarily. 
         
         
        Count (2) assault in company occasioning actual bodily harm contrary to the  
        Crimes Act  
        1900 s 59(2). The maximum penalty for such an offence is imprisonment for 7 years when dealt with on indictment or 2 years if dealt with summarily. 
        
       
      
    5 The applicant pleaded guilty to each count and on 21 April 2005 was sentenced in the District Court by Judge Nield. As to the first count his Honour deferred passing sentence conditionally upon the applicant entering into a bond pursuant to s 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (“the Act”) to be of good behaviour for a period of 12 months. As to the second count his Honour sentenced the applicant to imprisonment for 1 year and 6 months. He fixed a non-parole period of 9 months and a parole period of 9 months. He ordered that the sentence be served by periodic detention and fixed 5 May 2005 as the date of commencement of the sentence.6 The applicant has sought leave to appeal against the sentence on the second count on the grounds that:  
     
      
       
        
        (1) the sentence imposed by his Honour Judge Nield was manifestly excessive and outside the appropriate range; 
         
         
        (2) a sentence of periodic detention is no longer appropriate. 
        
       
      
    7 The circumstances of the offences were that the applicant was a concreting sub-contractor. He had sub-contracted to perform certain concreting works at a development site owned by a partnership comprising the complainant and a Mr Tauok. In June 2004 the applicant was paid by cheque for certain of the work done. The cheque was for $9,000. The applicant altered the cheque by increasing the amount to $19,000 and presented it at the bank for payment. The bank refused payment on the cheque. 
     
      
      Thereafter the complainant agreed to pay the $9,000, in cash, on 24 July 2004. On that day only $1,500 was paid. It was agreed the balance was to be paid at about twelve noon on 26 July 2004. At twelve noon on 26 July 2004 the applicant was told (as recorded by his Honour in his Remarks on Sentence) that : 
       
       
        
        the complainant would have to go to the bank and as he was very busy the [applicant] would have to wait. At about 12.30pm the complainant went to the Newtown branch of the ANZ bank and withdrew sufficient money to meet payment to the [applicant] and some other expenses. When he returned to the development site in his car the complainant was attacked by the [applicant] and four other men. One of the men was armed with a baton and two of the men were armed with hand guns. The men dragged the complainant out from his car and, notwithstanding that he said that he had the money for the [applicant], the men tried to drag him to the [applicant’s] car. The complainant called out for help and he fell to the ground and he was punched, kicked, struck with a baton and threatened with a hand gun. After Mr Tauok had gone to the aid of the complainant the men left the scene in the [applicant’s] car, with him driving it … the [applicant] disputes and, as I understand it, the Crown accepts, that he knew that one of the men was armed with a baton and that two of the men were armed with hand guns. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
      Ground One – The sentence imposed by his Honour Judge Nield was manifestly excessive and outside the appropriate range 
      
    8 The applicant was born on 15 July 1967 in Lebanon. He was educated to year 10 and obtained the matriculation certificate. He then worked in the building industry. In 1991 he married and shortly thereafter he migrated to Australia. In Australia he worked as a concreter and form worker in the building industry and in 1997 he and his wife established their own concreting business. He has three young children. 
     
      
    9 His Honour, in sentencing the Applicant, referred appropriately to sections 3A and 21A of the Act. He had before him a probation and parole presentence report dated 11 March 2005 which concluded: 
     
      
       
        
        The offender is eligible and has been assessed as suitable for a periodic detention order … and has signed an undertaking as required by section 66(1)(f) of [the Act]. 
        
       
      
    10 His Honour found that before his commission of the subject offences, the applicant was a man of unblemished character, well liked and well respected by those who knew him well and who regarded his commission of the subject offences as being contrary to his character; he was contrite, had the support of his wife, friends and business associates; he was not likely to re-offend and was likely to be rehabilitated; his guilty pleas were given at the earliest appropriate opportunity and entitled him to a 25% sentencing discount; the likelihood that he will not re-offend and will be rehabilitated were special circumstances which justified a non-parole period of nine months.  
     
      
    11 His Honour also found the second offence was a very serious offence. It was planned (albeit without much sophistication) and involved the actual use of violence and the actual use of a weapon, and it involved the threatened use of a hand gun and it, unfortunately, resulted in the complainant suffering some relatively minor injuries. 
     
      
       
      
    12 His Honour concluded: 
     
      
       
        
        The factors not referred to in s21A of the Act are one, deterrence, and two, the concurrent jurisdiction of the Local Court. As to deterrence, as I consider that the offender is not likely to re-offend and is likely to be rehabilitated, personal deterrence is not as important as it might be in another case. However, general deterrence is important. People, when owed money, must be aware that they cannot enforce payment of the money with the use of force. 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    13 In my opinion, it was open to his Honour, in the exercise of his sentencing discretion, to conclude that the objective seriousness of the offence, the criminality involved and the need for general deterrence could not have been adequately addressed by a suspended sentence or other non custodial sentence notwithstanding the very favourable findings made by his Honour as to the applicant’s subjective case. The sentence imposed by his Honour on count 2, having regard to the materials which were before him at the time of sentence, was well within the discretionary range open to him. I do not understand counsel for the applicant to contend otherwise.14 It was however submitted on behalf of the applicant that, since the imposition of sentence, and as a result of it, he had suffered from an adjustment disorder with anxiety and depression. This condition had prevented him attending the periodic detention centre on all but two occasions since the commencement of the order. It had had a profound effect upon the well being of the applicant and his family. He no longer worked and as a result various assets of the family had had to be sold. It was submitted that the applicant’s condition had resulted in a level of psychiatric and psychological disorder which took his case to a level where this Court should intervene and re-sentence. 15 In support of these submissions the applicant sought to tender affidavit evidence and reports of a psychiatrist and two psychologists which post dated the imposition of sentence as evidence to be taken into account in determining if the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive. The Crown submitted such evidence was inadmissible but accepted that the Court must see the evidence in order to rule upon it. 16 The general principle which has application in matters of this type was stated by this court in R v Munday (1981) 2 NSWLR 177 at 178 in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        It has been made plain in this Court on many occasions that the court is essentially charged with an appellate function involving the determination of whether a decision at first instance upon sentence was right or wrong, was excessive or inadequate, as things existed at the time when it was passed. The review of a sentence in the light of subsequent events is the proper province of the executive Government and not of an appeal court. 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    17 In R v Ashton (2002) 137 A Crim R 73 at 76 [10] it was held: 
     
      
       
        
        There is a firmly established principle that this Court will allow evidence to be introduced of events subsequent to the imposition of sentence concerning the physical or mental condition of the applicant where the existence or effect of that condition was unknown or not fully appreciated at the time sentence was passed. 
        
       
      
    18 The principle referred to in Ashton has application where the relevant condition existed at the time of the imposition of sentence but its existence or effect was unknown or not fully appreciated at that time. See Ashton (late manifestation of a pre-existing psychiatric condition) and the cases upon which it relied namely Bailey (1988) 35 A Crim R 458 (late diagnosis of AIDS Virus), R v Ehrenburg(NSWCCA, unreported, 14 December 1990), (late birth of deformed child as a result of complications of pregnancy) see also R v Mioduszewski (NSWCCA, unreported 28 May 2004). 
     
      
    19 In his remarks on sentence the learned sentencing Judge observed that the applicant was in good health and there was nothing untoward with his physical or mental health. The histories recorded in the reports which the applicant sought to tender were confirmatory of his Honour’s remarks.  
     
      
    20 Counsel for the applicant accepted the evidence did not establish the existence of a psychiatric condition which pre existed the imposition of sentence. The applicant had obtained an adjournment of the appeal on 28 September 2006 to seek expert evidence on that issue. The only report subsequent to that date sought to be tendered on behalf of the applicant was a report of the psychiatrist Dr Roberts dated 22 February 2007. That report did not traverse that issue. 
     
      
    21 The applicant was examined by a psychiatrist on behalf of the Crown. His reports were sought to be tendered in the event the applicant’s further evidence was admitted. He stated expressly that the applicant had no premorbid psychiatric illness or psychiatric disorder. He also opined that the applicant had the mental and physical capacity to serve his sentence and that his response was not unduly different to many other persons sentenced for similar offences. 
     
      
    22 The further evidence sought to be tendered does not establish the applicant, at the time of the imposition of sentence, was suffering from any psychiatric condition or one the effect of which was unknown or not fully appreciated at that time. The principle referred to in Ashton’s case has no application.  
     
      
    23 This Court in Ehrenburg stressed that the principle referred to in Ashton should be confined. 
     
      
    24 Loveday J, with whom Gleeson CJ agreed, said: 
     
      
       
        
        It must be stressed, however, this is a most unusual case. It will be unfortunate if the special facts and circumstance of this case, which I regard as borderline, were to be regarded as a general precedent for the review of a sentence by this Court in the light of subsequent events. Such a course is, as it has always been, a matter for the executive government (see  
        R v Munday 
         (1981) 2 NSWLR 177). 
        
       
       
      Samuels JA also agreed with Loveday J and cautioned against this Court erring in principle as a result of sympathy for an applicant. 
       
      
    25 In my opinion the principled approach to the law requires adherence to the principle expounded in R v Munday. Accordingly the additional evidence sought to be tendered must be rejected and this ground of appeal must fail. 
     
      
       
      Ground Two - A sentence of periodic detention is no longer appropriate 
      
    26 Section 66(1)(b) of the Act provides that a periodic detention order may not be made unless the court is satisfied that the offender is a suitable person to serve the sentence by way of periodic detention. The applicant sought to tender and rely upon a probation and parole service report dated 26 September 2006 which states: 
     
      
       
        
        The offender is eligible but has been assessed as unsuitable for a periodic detention order as per the requirements of s 66(1) of [the Act] … The reasons for unsuitability are as follows: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Mr Assaf declined to be assessed for a Periodic Detention Order, stating he cannot cope in a custodial setting. 
          
         
        
       
      
    27 It was submitted the report established that the applicant was no longer a suitable person to serve his sentence by periodic detention and that accordingly he should be re sentenced by this Court. 
     
      
    28 A Court may have regard to the contents of an assessment report on an offender or the evidence of a probation and parole officer in deciding whether to make a periodic detention order (s 66(2) of the Act), However the Court may make such an order notwithstanding an assessment report that an offender is not a suitable person to serve the sentence by way of periodic detention (s66(4)(a)). 
     
      
    29 The report dated 26 September 2006 is dependant purely upon a subjective opinion expressed by the applicant. Such a report, taken alone, would not cause a Court to decline to make an order for periodic detention. 
     
      
    30 In any event the report relates to events subsequent to the imposition of sentence and as such is not admissible – see R v Munday. This ground of appeal must also fail.31 In my opinion error has not been established. Accordingly, whilst I would grant leave to appeal, I would dismiss the appeal. 
     
      
    32 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
        
        (1) Leave to appeal granted. 
         
         
        (2) Appeal dismissed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: The issue before the court is whether it has jurisdiction to reopen Kathleen Folbigg’s appeal which was previously determined by the court. 
     
      
    2 The appellant, Kathleen Megan Folbigg was tried for four counts of murder and one count of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent. On 21 May 2003 a jury returned verdicts of guilty in respect of 3 counts of murder, one count of manslaughter and one count of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm. On 24 October 2003 the appellant was sentenced to imprisonment for 40 years with a non-parole period of 30 years. 
     
      
    3 A notice of appeal against conviction and sentence was filed on 8 July 2004. The appeal was heard in this Court on 26 November 2004 when judgment was reserved. 
     
      
    4 On 17 February 2005 the court delivered judgment. The appeal against conviction was dismissed but the appeal against sentence allowed and the appellant resentenced to a total period of imprisonment of 30 years with a non-parole period of 25 years. 
     
      
    5 On 18 February 2005 a solicitor employed by the Legal Aid Commission, who has had the carriage of the appellant’s matter, became aware of information concerning a possible irregularity in the consideration of the matter by the jury. He informed the Director of Public Prosecutions of the potential problem on 1 March 2005. The matter was then referred to the Office of the Sheriff and an investigation was conducted. The Sheriff prepared a report which was provided to the Supreme Court. 
     
      
    6 By letter dated 1 May 2006 the Prothonotary of the Supreme Court wrote to the solicitor for the appellant. In that letter he said:  
     
      
       
        
        “I am directed to inform you that at this stage there may be evidence of procedural irregularity. I am not at liberty to disclose to you or the Crown the contents of the Sheriff’s report at this stage. 
        
       
       
        
        The Court appears to be functus in this matter. You may recall that in  
        R v K  
        (2003) 59 NSWLR 431 and  
        R v Skaf  
        (2004) 60 NSWLR 86, the allegations in those trials were raised whilst an appeal was pending. It may be appropriate for your client to make an application under s 474D of the  
        Crimes Act  
        1900 to further progress the investigation.” 
        
       
      
    7 It will be necessary for me to trace the history of the matter in greater detail. However, it was not until 31 July 2006 that an application was made to reopen the appeal. 
     
      
    8 There is evidence before this Court which suggests that the orders of the Court of Criminal Appeal may have been entered on 5 July 2006. Upon the assumption that this occurred the Crown submitted that there is no jurisdiction in this Court to entertain an application to reopen the appeal. It was submitted that the appellant should be confined to any remedy which may be available pursuant to s 474D of the Crimes Act 1900 (now s 78 Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 No 120). 
     
      
    9 The appellant’s position is that this Court could not find that the order was entered on 5 July and indeed could not be satisfied that it was entered before the application which was made on 31 July 2006. Accordingly, it is submitted that, even if thereafter the order was perfected, this Court has jurisdiction to consider a further ground of appeal (see Regina v Lapa (No 2) (1995) 80 A Crim R 398; R vReardon (No 2) (2004) 60 NSWLR 454). 
     
      
       
      Relevant provisions of the Criminal Appeal Rules 
       
      
    10 The Criminal Appeal rules provide for the determination of appeals and the entry of the orders. Rules 50A to 54 are in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        50A Determination of appeal or application 
         
        An appeal or application for leave to appeal is determined on the making of orders disposing of the appeal or application. 
        
       
       
        
        NOTIFYING RESULTS OF APPEAL 
         
        51 Notice of determination of appeal etc 
         
        The Registrar shall send a notice (Forms Nos XI and XII) of the determination of any appeal, or of any application incidental thereto, to the appellant, if he was not present when the matter was determined, to the proper office of the Court of Trial, to the Director-General of Corrective Services and to the Sheriff, if the appeal is against a conviction involving a sentence of death or is against a sentence of death. 
        
       
       
        
        52 Notice of orders or directions by Court 
         
        The Registrar shall also notify the proper officer of the Court of Trial of any orders or directions made or given by the Court in relation to such appeal. 
        
       
       
        
        53 Records of Court of Trial to be noted 
         
        (1) Such proper officer shall thereupon enter the particulars of such notification on the records of the Court of Trial. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) Such entry shall be made in conformity with the administration of the Court of Trial on: 
         
         (a) the indictment, 
         
         (b) the appropriate Court file, or 
         
         (c) the appropriate computer record. 
        
       
       
        
        54 Depositions etc to be returned 
         
        After the final determination of any appeal, or the final refusal of any application for leave to appeal, the Registrar shall, subject to any order made by the Court, return to the officer from whom he received them all depositions, pleadings, inquisitions or other documents relating to such matter.” 
        
       
      
    11 The “Proper Officer of the Court of Trial” is defined by r 1 to mean “the officer who has the custody of the records of the Court of Trial.” The “Court of Trial” is the trial court from whom the appeal was brought (s 2 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912). The Court of Trial in the present matter was the Supreme Court. Accordingly, the orders of this Court were perfected when the particulars of a Notification made to the Prothonotary were entered on the records of the Supreme Court. Pursuant to r 53(2) the entry could have been made on the indictment, the appropriate court file, or the appropriate computer record. However, the evidence indicates that the relevant administrative practice of the Supreme Court has been to attach the orders of this Court to the trial indictment. Accordingly, the date on which this occurred is the issue which this Court must presently resolve. 
     
      
       
      The relevant events 
       
      
    12 The Prothonotary of the Supreme Court, Mr Riznyczok, is the Registrar of the Common Law Division of the Court to which the criminal list had been assigned. He gave evidence that he received a report from the Sheriff concerning an investigation into an alleged irregularity in the trial of the appellant. He says that he drew this possible irregularity to the attention of both the Legal Aid Commission and the Director of Public Prosecutions. Apparently the parties were already aware of the issue but the matter was formally brought to their attention by letter from the Prothonotary dated 1 May 2006. I have already referred to the letter written to the appellant’s solicitor [6]. The allegation was that a member of the jury may have researched the appellant’s personal and family history on the internet during the course of the trial. 
     
      
    13 On 19 June 2006 the appellant’s solicitor wrote to the Prothonotary indicating that his client may wish to make an application to reopen the appeal. The solicitor questioned whether the order of the Court of Criminal Appeal had been perfected. He said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I would request that you enquire as to whether or not the order or judgment of the CCA has been perfected in the Court of Trial in accordance with the rules. I would request that forward (sic) to me a copy of the appropriate record which is said to perfect the order or judgment if that has happened.  
        
       
       
        
        Given the consequences of this particular matter I would request that if the order has not been perfected that you do not take any action to perfect the order until you notify myself and further submissions are considered.” 
        
       
      
    14 Thereafter the Prothonotary took steps to locate the court file and the indictment and made enquiries as to whether the orders of the Court of Criminal Appeal had been entered. The Prothonotary recognised the importance of the issue and directed the relevant officer, Mr Lacey, to “have somebody inspect the file and indictment to check whether a copy of the CCA result has been filed with either file.” The Prothonotary was told by Mr Lacey: 
     
      
       
        
        “It’s unlikely we have entered the results. We haven’t had the resources to do that for some time now as we have been focused on getting the appeal books up to date. There have been a number of staff changes and we have a number of office temps who aren’t up to speed yet.” 
        
       
      
    15 The Prothonotary said to Mr Lacey: 
     
      
       
        
        “This is an important issue as it will determine whether Ms Folbigg will need to proceed by way of 474 or whether she can reopen her appeal. Somebody will have to inspect the file. If the orders haven’t entered, then they must not be entered until this is resolved.” 
        
       
      
    16 A search was made and it was reported to the Prothonotary that although results had been found for an interlocutory appeal the ultimate appeal “results” had not been found for the “last appeal.” 
     
      
    17 The Prothonotary took steps to have these findings confirmed. He went himself to the office of the Court of Criminal Appeal Registrar but could not find anything which indicated the entry of the Court of Criminal Appeal orders in the final appeal. He also spoke to another officer, Mr Godfrey, and asked him to check the computer system to determine whether the Court of Criminal Appeal orders had been entered on the record of the trial. The Prothonotary satisfied himself that they had not been entered. The Prothonotary also satisfied himself that no entry had been made on the CourtNet system which was then being used to record details of criminal cases. 
     
      
    18 Ultimately the Prothonotary came to the conclusion that the orders of the Court of Criminal Appeal had not been entered into the records of the Supreme Court. The Prothonotary wrote to the solicitor for the appellant on 14 July 2006 in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “… 
        
       
       
        
        A search of the court file reveals that a copy of the notification from the Court of Criminal Appeal has not been attached to either the indictment or placed in the trial file for Ms Folbigg. 
        
       
       
        
        I also understand that a notation of the Court of Criminal Appeal’s order has not been made on the Court’s computer system either.  
        
       
       
        
        At this stage, I am unable to confirm that the particulars of the determination of the Court of Criminal Appeal have been entered on the Supreme Court’s trial file. 
        
       
       
        
        On the assumption that the determination has not been entered, no steps have been taken to enter it at this stage.  
        
       
       
        
        I will cause the particulars to entered (sic) after a suitable period of time should your client not proceed with an application to reopen the appeal, or should your client intend to proceed with a section 474D instead. I will give you notice before I do so, so that you may make any necessary application.” 
        
       
      
    19 Mr Lacey also gave evidence. In his affidavit he said that he received an email from the Prothonotary on 28 June 2006 asking that he extract the Folbigg trial file and the folder containing the appellant’s indictment. He said that the Prothonotary asked Mr Lacey to place these documents in the office of the Court of Criminal Appeal Registrar.  
     
      
    20 Mr Lacey complied with the request and said that in early July he looked through the file and noticed that the trial indictment was still on it. However, there was no notification of the Court of Criminal Appeal orders on the file. He also checked the lever arch folders in which the court kept trial indictments but could not locate a copy of the indictment relating to the appellant.  
     
      
    21 Sometime in early July 2006, but after he had inspected the appellant’s file, Mr Lacey directed Mr Byron, who was a clerk in the court registry, to process orders of the Court of Criminal Appeal and ensure they were attached to the relevant trial indictments. There is no evidence that he gave Mr Byron particular instructions in relation to the appellant’s matter. 
     
      
    22 Mr Byron also gave evidence. He said that sometime in July 2006 Mr Lacey directed him to print out “Notifications of the Court of Criminal Appeal matters and attach them to the Supreme Court indictment to which they related.” Mr Lacey also advised him to stamp each of the notifications and sign them. 
     
      
    23 Mr Byron was given 5 lever arch folders each of which contained a number of indictments in plastic sleeves. They were collected by calendar year. He was advised to commence with the most recent notifications and proceed backwards. Mr Byron said that some of the folders contained indictments with notifications already stamped, signed and attached, but there were many without notifications attached. Some notifications were held loosely in the back cover of the folder. Some of these were already stamped but were not signed. Others were neither stamped or signed. For some matters a notification had not been printed and accordingly Mr Byron was required to find the notification on the computer system and print it out. He said that he first undertook this task before attaching the notifications to the indictments. 
     
      
    24 He said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The practice I followed was to access the sub directory called ‘notifications’ in the computer system for the matter for which I located an indictment in the relevant folder. Once I located the relevant Notification, I then printed the Notification out. At the time I attached the notification to each indictment, I would then stamp it with the stamp I was provided, bearing the date I attached it to the indictment, and sign it. I would then staple it to the indictment. On some occasions I did the process with one indictment from start to finish -- that is I printed, signed, stamped and attached the notification to an indictment in the one episode. On other occasions, I printed a number of notifications, then signed and stamped each one in that group, and then attached them to the relevant indictments. In some instances, there was a delay of several days between the various steps in the process I have described. 
        
       
       
        
        I have viewed the folder marked 2003, containing a number of blue indictments. In that folder, there are 25 indictments bearing Notifications stamped ‘5 July 2006’ and signed by me. I stapled each of the Notifications to these indictments. The trial indictment in Folbigg is one of the indictments with the notification attached in that folder. It is the 15th indictment with such notification attached, stamped and signed by me in that folder.” 
        
       
      
    25 Mr Byron has no recollection of dealing with the appellant’s indictment. However, he says of the process which he undertook: 
     
      
       
        
        “On most occasions, I would attach, stamp and sign the notifications to the indictments at the same time. However, on some occasions there was a delay of several days between the step of printing, signing, stamping and attaching. For example, I may have stamped the notification, but then had to attend to other tasks, or had a day off, and attached the notification to the indictment on another day after that. 
        
       
       
        
        When I say in some instances there was a delay of several days between various steps, from my estimate, it would not have been any more than about a week from the time the notification was stamped to the time I attached it to the indictment.” 
        
       
      
    26 Although the appellant carries the burden of persuading the court to reopen her appeal it is the Crown which asserts that the application is barred by reason of the perfection of the order. Accordingly, the Crown carries the onus of proving that the order was perfected before the application was made. In my opinion that onus has not been discharged. 
     
      
    27 Although the stamp on the notification of the court’s determination of the application for the appellant bears the date 5 July 2006, this cannot be the date on which the orders were entered. The evidence of the Prothonotary indicates that the notification had not been attached to the indictment by 14 July. Although Mr Byron said it was usual for him to attach the notification to the indictment within about a week as I have indicated he does not recall processing the appellant’s indictment. It must be remembered that the file had been placed in the office of the Court of Criminal Appeal Registrar with orders from the Prothonotary that judgment not be entered until the matter was resolved. There is no reason to conclude that his instructions were not carried out with the consequence that the orders would not have been entered until after the application to reopen had been filed. In these circumstances I could not find that the order of the Court of Criminal Appeal was attached to the appellant’s indictment before the appellant filed her application to reopen the appeal on 31 July 2006.  
     
      
    28 In these circumstances I am satisfied that this Court has jurisdiction to entertain the appellant’s application. Although the order has subsequently been perfected this is not a bar to the making of the application. In Lapa Clarke JA said: 
     
      
       
        
        “For my part there are two considerations which lead me to conclude that, accepting that the power of the court to vary a judgment cannot be enlivened, absent any relevant rule, after the judgment has been perfected it does have power to remedy an oversight here application is made before that has occurred, notwithstanding that the judgment is perfected while the court is considering the matter. The fundamental consideration which should determine whether a court of criminal appeal should reconsider its judgment is whether the failure to do so might lead to a miscarriage of justice. To put it another way, the application should be determined upon the interests of justice, giving full weight to the principle of finality.” 
        
       
      
    29 The appellant also submitted that even if the orders had been perfected this Court has jurisdiction to reopen the appeal. That jurisdiction was said to be founded upon the power of the court to ensure that its intentions, as expressed by the Prothonotary, were given effect to. In the alternative it was submitted that the residual discretion recognised in Lapa and acknowledged in Burrell v R [2007] NSWCCA 79 permits this Court, in the circumstances of the present case, to reopen the appeal. 
     
      
    30 Although the appellant acknowledged the significance of the principle of finality, it was submitted that the circumstances of the present case are such that this Court would be careful to ensure that an injustice was not occasioned to the appellant. The possible necessity for an application was identified well before the court’s order was perfected, whatever be the date upon which that occurred. At a time when the prospect of such an application was imminent the appellant’s solicitor was informed that the order had not been perfected and no further step towards perfection would be taken until the applicant had an opportunity to finally consider the matter. If, as the Crown submitted, that opportunity was lost it was not occasioned by any fault on the part of the appellant but by a failure within the court whereby the Prothonotary’s directive that the order not be entered was not carried out. 
     
      
    31 It is unnecessary to resolve these arguments. However, I would be reluctant to accept that where the court has undertaken to a party that it will not take a step which could extinguish that party’s right to seek leave to reopen an appeal without further notice and that undertaking is breached, that party is precluded from seeking relief from this Court. 
     
      
    32 I am satisfied that this Court may proceed to hear the appellant’s substantial application and directions should now be made for the further conduct of the matter.

    JUDGMENT1. In this matter a witness Miss Al Hinti was giving evidence on 14 May 2007. She attended the police station at Auburn on the night of 30 January and the early morning of 31 January 2005. She attended in the capacity of her role as an ethnic community liaison officer. 2. One of the most important tasks which she had in that capacity was liaison and enhancing the relationship between the police and the community. It was a particularly challenging role in respect of the Arabic speaking community around Auburn at that particular time and she had been somewhat successful in building up that liaison between the police and members of that community. 3. She was asked by the Crown Prosecutor in re-examination concerning her attendance at the police station that evening whether one person there acted as a spokesperson for the mostly Shi'ite members of the community who were at the police station that night. She said ""Yes"" and said that she knew the name of that person. When asked by the Crown Prosecutor to provide the name, she said, ""I can't discuss this information I am afraid at this time"". 4. There was then a brief discussion about whether or not there would be an application for public interest immunity in respect of that answer. That application has been formalised today with Mr Bourke appearing on behalf of the Commissioner of Police and making an application under section 130(4)(e) of the Evidence Act 1995 for a direction from me that the answer to the question ""Who is the spokesperson?"" not be adduced in evidence from Miss Al Hinti. The basis, as I have said, is that the evidence would relate to matters of state in the sense that it would disclose or enable someone to ascertain the existence or identity of a confidential source of information relating to the enforcement or administration of a law of the state. 5. Mr Bourke adduced evidence from Miss Al Hinti and tendered as exhibit 1 a handbook in respect of local ethnic community liaison officers. Miss Al Hinti, amongst other things, in evidence when asked what the consequences of disclosure of the name would be, said that it would jeopardise the relationship which she had so far built up with some struggle. The nature of her role had been new and it could jeopardise her successor. One of the most important aspects of her role was allowing members of the community to communicate effectively with the police. If she were to disclose the name of that person, it would jeopardise that relationship between an element of the community at Auburn, or at least in the Flemington Local Area Command, and the police. It would also engender some degree of mistrust and would have a great and unfortunate impact if the name were to be disclosed. 6. The forensic purpose so far as the Crown is concerned in wanting to adduce the evidence is to deal with a possible submission, indeed a likely submission from defence counsel, that there has been a degree of collusion between witnesses who were present at the police station that night. The absence of the person whom the jury have heard is the spokesperson may result in defence counsel inviting the jury to infer that such a person has not been called by the Crown and would therefore be unhelpful to the Crown. 7. In my opinion the impact of an order to disclose the name outweighs the importance of its disclosure. Important as it is to the Crown, the sanctity of confidential police informers has been protected by the courts for decades. This appears to me on the evidence to be an example of a relationship between the police and a member of the community who is also a source of information which would be jeopardised. More importantly, if I ordered the disclosure in this case, it would have a wider impact and other people would be less inclined to step into that role of assisting the police in that regard. Accordingly I direct that the answer to the question ""Who was the spokesperson that night at the Auburn Police Station?"" not be adduced as evidence.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 PRICE J: This is an application for leave to appeal by Michael Nicholas Saban (conveniently referred to as the applicant) against the severity of the sentence imposed upon him in the District Court at Bathurst by Nield DCJ on 3 August 2006. 
     
      
    2 The applicant pleaded guilty in the Local Court to a charge of robbery in circumstances of aggravation contrary to s 95 of the Crimes Act 1900 and adhered to that plea when he appeared before his Honour on 26 July 2006.  
     
      
    3 An offence contrary to s 95 of the Crimes Act is punishable by imprisonment for twenty years. 
     
      
    4 On 3 August 2006, the applicant was sentenced by his Honour to imprisonment for six years and nine months. The Judge fixed a non-parole period of four years and nine months to commence on 1 October 2005 and to expire on 30 June 2010 with a parole period of two years to commence on 1 July 2010 and to expire on 30 June 2012. 
     
      
    5 Three offences on a Form 1 were taken into account on sentence namely one offence of common assault contrary to s 61 of the Crimes Act and two counts of demanding property with menaces contrary to s 99(1) of the Crimes Act. 
     
      
       
      The facts 
       
      
    6 An agreed statement of facts was placed before the Judge and may be conveniently summarised. 
     
      
       
      Form 1 offence 1 (assault): 
       
       
      On 30 September 2005 at approximately 5pm the applicant uninvited joined a group of acquaintances at a flat in Bathurst. He then followed the victim (Ms Nightingale) and her boyfriend as they went for a walk. The victim and her boyfriend entered into a “play fight.” The applicant took exception to this and then threatened the victim before producing a knife. He started waving the knife around and made jabbing motions towards the victim’s face. The applicant then pushed her in the chest causing her to trip and lose her balance. He then took hold of her neck and shoulder before the male friend intervened. The victim then ran away and the applicant followed her with the knife in his hand. 
       
       
      Indictment (aggravated robbery) and Form 1 offence 2 (demand with menace): 
       
       
      Later on that same day, the applicant approached the victim (Mr Tidsell) who had returned home on his motor bike. He offered to buy the bike from the victim who repeatedly told him he was not interested in selling it and tried to get away. The applicant came up beside him and put his arm tightly around the victim. He insisted that the victim come with him next door. The victim was unable to pull away and went with him. The applicant suddenly grabbed the victim and pushed his face into a wall. The applicant told him to spread his legs so he could search him for the registration papers for the bike. The applicant produced a knife and thrust it towards the victim’s chest. He then said to the victim: 
       
       
        
        “You are going to sell me the bike or give it to me or else I’m going to stab you. I don’t care if I go to jail (sic) it would be worth it.” 
        
       
       
      The applicant continued to press the knife into the victim’s chest. Having discovered the victim’s mobile phone, he took it. The applicant continued asking for a receipt saying that the bike was his. He insisted that the victim call him by his name and say “Yes, Michael” to everything he was saying or he would stab him. The victim fearing for his life started to dry retch. The applicant grabbed the victim who fell backwards then escaped leaving the applicant in possession of his mobile phone. 
       
      
    Form 1 offence 3 (demand with menace):  
     
      
       
      At around 10am on the next day the applicant went to the “Returns Desk” at K-Mart in Bathurst with an unknown male. He demanded that staff give the other male a refund for goods he was presenting, which was refused as there was no receipt. The applicant then abused and threatened staff saying: 
       
        
         
        “Fuck off I’m not scared of you. Give him the money or I’ll do time for you. I’ve been to prison, it doesn’t scare me, give him the fucking money or else!”  
        
       
      
    Police were called and the applicant was arrested. 
     
      
     Subjective circumstances 
     
      
    7 Evidence of the applicant’s subjective circumstances was before the Judge by way of a report of a psychologist, Suzanne Freeman, and the oral evidence of the applicant himself and his brother, Mario Saban. 
     
      
    8 The applicant was born on 8 June 1974 and at the time of offending was aged 31 years. It appears that he had a very dysfunctional and fearful early life. The family moved to Bathurst when he was a child. His parents were of Croation background. His father, a violent alcoholic, physically abused all members of his family. There were nine children, the applicant being the fifth child. Two of the daughters were sexually abused. The children were often hungry and their father who was on a pension scavenged for food from supermarket bins. As a result of his father’s behaviour the applicant was treated as an outcast at school. When he was 11 years old, his parents separated. The applicant’s father after making several threats that he would do so committed suicide by burning down the house with himself inside. After his father’s death, the applicant attempted to overdose on tablets. 
     
      
    9 The applicant was expelled from school at the beginning of year 9. After leaving school he attended Bathurst TAFE where he completed an apprenticeship course in spray painting. 
     
      
    10 He had commenced using cannabis and drinking alcohol at about the age of 12 or 13. After he left school he was drinking daily although not when he was in employment. He moved to Western Australia in about 1994-1995. The applicant has had various jobs the last being with Beaurepaires in Sydney following his return to New South Wales. 
     
      
    11 The psychologist in her report noted that when the offences occurred he had been drinking and the applicant had stated he “cannot remember much” because he “got really totalled”. He expressed his remorse for his [offending] behaviour and he recently recognised he had a big problem with alcohol. Recently the applicant completed a drug and alcohol relapse and prevention course in Parklea Correctional Centre. 
     
      
    12 During his evidence, the applicant told the Judge that he had never thought about his addiction to alcohol “as much as I have this time in this prison sentence…..” and “I even got off my own behind and approached the drug and alcohol person in, in prison at Parklea and did a, a drug awareness certificate program”. (T13, 26/07/06) 
     
      
    13 Ms Freeman opined that the applicant is extremely anxious and suffers from symptoms of depression. He has a withdrawn, isolated personality style with strong depressive, self-defeating and anti-social features. He requires counselling to help alleviate his depression and anxiety and to help him improve his self-esteem.  
     
      
     Prior criminal history  
     
      
    14 The applicant has a lengthy criminal record as a juvenile and as an adult. Included in that record are sentences of imprisonment in New South Wales for offences of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and malicious wounding. Of particular significance are convictions in Western Australia on 12 June 2000 in the Perth District Court for robbery and threats to injure and in the same court on 12 April 2002 for receiving, burglary and breach of suspended sentences. 
     
      
    15 For the offences which I have last mentioned the applicant received a total sentence of 6 years imprisonment to date from 25 December 2001. It appears that the applicant was released on parole which was transferred to New South Wales.  
     
      
    16 It is appropriate to note that at the time of the commission of the present offences the applicant was subject to that parole.  
     
      
     Dealing with the Appeal  
     
      
    17 The sole ground of appeal is the applicant’s contention that the Judge gave insufficient weight to the applicant’s background and prospects of rehabilitation as a consequence of which the sentence is manifestly excessive. 
     
      
    18 The applicant contends that his Honour gave only cursory attention to the background of extreme deprivation and violence and the Judge’s only regard to that was a reference to the psychologist’s report. The applicant complains that his Honour remarked that he was unaware of anything untoward in the applicant’s mental state despite references in the psychologist’s report to several suicide attempts and symptoms of depression. 
     
      
    19 It is evident from his Honour’s remarks that he paid more than cursory attention to the background of the offending. He referred to the psychologist’s report and to the applicant’s background and upbringing. The Judge acknowledged the tragic death of the applicant’s father, his unhappy childhood and teenage years. He noted his excessive consumption of alcohol and smoking of cannabis. His Honour, however, did not expressly mention the applicant’s attempted suicides and the psychologist’s assessment of continuing depression and anxiety. The Judge did note [ROS at para 11] that [the applicant] “has suffered episodes of depression”. In any event, the assessment made by Ms Freeman was confined, as mentioned, to depression and anxiety.  
     
      
    20 The applicant complains that it was not open to his Honour to find that the applicant had no desire to change his ways and would be likely to re-offend. There was evidence before the Judge, the applicant contends, that he had for the first time recognised that he has a problem with alcohol and had sought to address this problem.  
     
      
    21 This contention is based on remarks on sentence made by the Judge. His Honour, relevantly, said (ROS at para 27): 
     
      
       
        
        “As to the prospects of the offender’s rehabilitation and the likelihood of the offender not re-offending, I doubt that, having regard to his past, the offender has any desire to change his ways and I suspect that, if he does not get his way or want (sic) he wants, he will re-offend.” 
        
       
      
    22 His honour had earlier noted that [the applicant] had been dealt with for fifteen offences in New South Wales, one offence in Queensland and twenty offences in Western Australia.  
     
      
     His Honour remarked: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is obvious and fair to say that the offender has learnt nothing whatsoever from his earlier offending and the sentences imposed upon him for those offences.” (ROS at para 8) 
        
       
       
      
    23 It was open to his Honour, a very experienced sentencing Judge, to be doubtful about the prisoner’s prospects of rehabilitation.  
     
      
    24 The applicant has an unattractive history of similar offending and the present criminality occurred whilst he was subject to parole. The Judge was not obliged to accept without question the evidence of the applicant.  
     
      
    25 His Honour accepted that the plea of guilty demonstrated remorse for the offence and identified as one of the mitigating factors the provisions of s 21A(3)(i) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1989. The Judge also accepted that the aggravated robbery was unplanned.  
     
      
    26 In determining the appropriate sentence, his Honour took into account, as he was required to do, the offences on the Form 1 and appropriately remarked “that the sentence for the aggravated robbery offence will be longer than the sentence that would have been imposed for it had it been the only offence” and cited recent authorities: see Des Rosiers v R [2006] NSWCCA 16, Regina v Stankovic [2006] NSWCCA 229. 
     
      
    27 Offence 1 on the Form 1 was an offence discrete from the aggravated robbery as was offence 3. The applicant’s offending in the commission of the offence of common assault included threatening the victim by the use of a knife. 
     
      
    28 The criminality involved in the Form 1 offences was such that the Judge was entitled to significantly increase the penalty for the primary offence. 
     
      
    29 From the identification by his Honour of the aggravating factors taken into account in determining the appropriate sentence it is apparent that he did not regard the applicant’s record of previous convictions as an aggravating factor. The Judge considered that both general and personal deterrence to be important. His Honour remarked [ROS at para 28]: 
     
      
       
        
        “The offender must be reminded, yet again, and loudly and clearly, that repeat offending will not be tolerated.” 
        
       
      
    30 His Honour was entitled to have regard to the applicant’s record of repeat offending in giving more weight to retribution, personal deterrence and the protection of the community than would be the case if such a record did not exist: see R v M.A.K R v M.S.K [2006] NSWCCA 381 [at 51], R v McNaughton [2006] NSWCCA 242.  
     
      
    31 The primary offence was a serious offence during which the victim was manhandled by the applicant, threatened with a knife, his clothes searched and phone was stolen. 
     
      
    32 In his sentencing remarks, his Honour referred to a number of considerations in R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 436, the guideline judgment on armed robbery offences. The applicant’s criminal history and the offences on the Form 1 are factors which justify a sentence above the sentencing range identified in Henry. 
     
      
    33 His Honour appropriately determined that the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty attracted a discount of 25 per cent. 
     
      
    34 An offence contrary to s 95 of the Crimes Act is punishable by 20 years imprisonment. Notwithstanding the subjective features of the applicant, an undiscounted starting point of the sentence of nine years was within an appropriate range. I am not persuaded that the Judge gave insufficient weight to the subjective background of the applicant and his prospects of rehabilitation. I am unable to find that the sentence was manifestly excessive.  
     
      
    35 The Judge did not find special circumstances and it was within his discretion not to do so. Although such a finding was made, a balance of term was fixed which exceeds one third of the non-parole period of the sentence. As the error favours the applicant, I do not propose to interfere with it.  
     
      
    36 I propose that leave to appeal be granted, but the appeal be dismissed.  
     
      
    37 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree.  
     
      
    38 HIDDEN J: The sentence was undoubtedly severe but I am not persuaded that it was outside the bounds legitimately open to his Honour. I say so in the light of the extent of the applicant’s criminality, whilst mindful of his shocking background and such signs as did emerge from the evidence. One can hope that he will undergo rehabilitation upon his release. 
     
      
    39 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: The orders of the Court will be as proposed by Justice Price.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: The appellant is being tried before a judge and jury in the Supreme Court on an indictment which alleges  
     
      
       
      (a) one count of defrauding the Commonwealth contrary to s.29D  
      Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) 
      ;  
       
       
      (b) one count of agreeing to receive a benefit on an understanding that the exercise by him of his duty as a Commonwealth officer would be affected contrary to s.73  
      Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) 
      ; and  
       
       
      (c) one count of publishing to a person to whom he was not authorised to publish, documents which came into his possession by virtue of him being a Commonwealth officer and which it was his duty not to disclose, an offence under s.70  
      Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) 
      . 
       
      
    2 The trial which is taking place is a retrial. At the appellant’s first trial the jury was unable to agree and was discharged. 
     
      
    3 The jury at the present trial was selected on 26 March 2007 and the trial commenced. 
     
      
    4 On Monday 7 May (which was day 25 of the trial) a member of the jury failed to attend court and inquiries were made. Those inquiries revealed that the juror had been arrested over the week end of 5-6 May 2007 and charged with offences of resist police, driving recklessly, driving an unregistered motor vehicle, driving whilst disqualified and exceeding the speed limit by more than 45 kph. Following his arrest he was refused bail. 
     
      
    5 When this information became available to the trial judge further enquiries were made and it was ascertained that the juror had been disqualified from driving by a court order for a period of four years on 12 April 2002 with further periods of disqualification being ordered by courts for other offences. The juror has been disqualified from driving until 24 April 2015. 
     
      
    6 Section 6(a) of the Jury Act 1977 provides that a person is not qualified to serve as a juror if that person is presently disqualified. The list of disqualified persons is provided by Schedule 1 to the Act and includes a person who is currently bound by an order including an order disqualifying the person from driving a motor vehicle (Schedule 1 clause 3(a)). Accordingly, the absent juror was at all times a person disqualified and accordingly not qualified to serve as a juror. 
     
      
    7 Following the disclosure of these matters to the parties the appellant moved for the discharge of the jury. The Crown opposed that course and submitted that the trial judge should discharge the absent juror but order that the trial continue with a jury constituted by the remaining 11 jurors in accordance with s 22 of the Jury Act. The trial judge declined to take the course urged by the appellant and made the following orders: 
     
      
       
        
        “(a) The juror whom I have described as the absent juror is discharged, under s.22(a)  
        Jury Act 1977 
        ; 
        
       
       
        
        (b) I order, under s.22(a)  
        Jury Act 1977 
        , 
          
        that the remaining eleven jurors be considered as remaining, for all purposes of the trial, to be properly constituted as the jury;  
        
       
       
        
        (c) Until further order of the Court, I make an order prohibiting publication of the matters revealed in the course of these proceedings on 8, 9 and 10 May 2007 concerning the absent juror, the reasons for his absence from this trial and the reasons for my order discharging him under s.22(a)  
        Jury Act 1977 
        . “ 
        
       
      
    8 Following the delivery of his Honour’s judgment senior counsel for the appellant indicated that he had instructions to appeal to this Court pursuant to s 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. He asked the trial judge for a certificate pursuant to s 5F(3)(b) of the Act. The trial judge determined to grant the certificate and as a consequence the appellant may appeal to this Court as of right. 
     
      
    9 The appellant’s argument raised for consideration whether in the events that have happened the appellant was being tried by a jury as required by s 80 of the Constitution. For that reason notices pursuant to s 78B of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) were issued. Only the State of New South Wales sought to intervene in the proceedings. 
     
      
       
      The appellant’s argument 
       
      
    10 The appellant submitted that by reason of the fact that one of the members of the jury was disqualified from serving as a juror the trial had miscarried and the jury must be discharged. Section 19 of the Jury Act provides that the jury “is to consist of 12 persons returned and selected in accordance with this Act.” It was submitted that persons referred to in s 19 must be persons who are not disqualified or ineligible to serve. Accordingly, if, as happened in the present case, a person who is disqualified is returned and selected a fundamental breach of the Jury Act has been committed. 
     
      
    11 It was submitted that that breach cannot be cured by the discharge of the disqualified juror. Although s 22 provides that in the event that a juror is discharged “whether as being through illness incapable of continuing to act or for any other reason” and if the judge so orders, the jury subject to certain conditions, remains for all the purposes of the trial, it was submitted that the section does not contemplate the jury remaining when it had included from the outset a person or persons who were not lawfully a member of it. It was submitted that although the jury comprised 12 persons it was not constituted as required by law and s 22 could not operate to allow it to remain. 
     
      
       
      The respondents’ submission 
       
      
    12 The respondents submitted that s 22 would allow the discharge of the disqualified juror and permit the trial to continue with a jury of 11. It was submitted that the proper understanding of s 22 was informed by s 73. Section 73(a) provides that the verdict of a jury shall not be affected or invalidated by reason only: 
     
      
       
        
        “(a) that any member of the jury was disqualified from serving as a juror or ineligible to serve as a juror.” 
        
       
      
    13 It was submitted that the legislature had accordingly recognised that a trial may take place when through inadvertence a member of the jury was disqualified from serving but had clearly intended that if that event should occur the verdict could not later be challenged. It was submitted that in these circumstances it can be comfortably inferred that the legislature intended that if it was discovered during the trial that a juror was disqualified s 22 could be utilised to remove the juror without affecting the lawfulness of the trial. 
     
      
       
      The appellant’s response 
       
      
    14 The appellant responded by submitting that s 73 was a significant intrusion into the common law which adopted a strict approach to the essential elements of a jury trial, including the selection and empanelling of the jury. It was submitted that s 73 must be strictly construed and, although it would operate to save the verdict, it could not operate to validate a trial where there was a material defect in the constitution of the jury. The appellant accepted that there were evident policy reasons why the legislature should provide that if a trial has concluded and a verdict has been entered, be it acquittal or conviction, the law should preclude a challenge to it. However, when the opportunity is available to remedy the defect before the trial has been completed it was submitted that the court is required to discharge the jury to enable the accused to be tried according to law. 
     
      
       
      Discussion 
       
      
    15 The origins of trial by jury have been considered by the High Court on a number of occasions (see Wu v The Queen (1999) 199 CLR 99 esp Kirby J at 111 ff Callinan J at 132-133; see also Cheatle v The Queen (1993) 177 CLR 541 at 550-552). From the time orthodox juries were introduced to New South Wales the relevant statutes provided for a jury comprised of twelve persons. The common law did not provide for a judge to discharge an individual juror although the entire jury could be discharged in a “case of evident necessity.” 
     
      
    16 The Jury Act was amended in 1929 to empower a judge to discharge up to two jurors and order that the trial continue. The Jury Act 1977 continued that position. 
     
      
    17 As Kirby J observed in Wu at [46] s 22 of the Act does not expressly confer on the judge a power or discretion to discharge a juror. This power derives from the inherent or implied powers of the particular court. However, if the judge orders the discharge of an individual juror s 22 is available so that in the appropriate circumstances a judge is not obliged to discharge the entire jury, but may order that the trial continue with less than 12 jury members. 
     
      
    18 Section 22 is in the following terms 
     
      
       
        
        “Where in the course of any trial or coronial inquest any member of the jury dies or is discharged by the court or coroner whether as being through illness incapable of continuing to act or for any other reason, the jury shall be considered as remaining for all the purposes of that trial or inquest properly constituted if:  
         
         
        (a) in the case of criminal proceedings, the number of its members:  
         
        (i) is not reduced below 10, 
         
          
          (ii) is reduced below 10 but approval in writing is given to the reduced number of jurors by or on behalf of both the person prosecuting for the Crown and the accused or each of the accused, or 
           
          (iii) is reduced below 10 but not below 8 and the trial has been in progress for at least 2 months, 
          
         
         
        (b) in the case of civil proceedings, the number of its members is not reduced, in the case of a jury of 4, below 3 or, in the case of a jury of 12, below 8, or 
         
         
        (c) in the case of a coronial inquest, the number of its members is not reduced below 4, 
         
         
        and if the court or the coroner, as the case may be, so orders.” 
        
       
      
    19 The question in this case is whether the power in s 22 is available when the jury empanelled for a trial was comprised of at least one person who was disqualified and that person has been discharged. 
     
      
    20 Section 19 of the Jury Act provides that in the Supreme Court the jury “is to consist of 12 persons returned and selected in accordance with (the) Act.” The significance of that requirement cannot be understated. As the statutory enactment of the common law position, which had prevailed in England for hundreds of years, it lies at the heart of our system of trial by jury. 
     
      
    21 There have been a number of instances where a failure to comply with the legislation providing for the selection of jurors has been found to result in a “departure from the essential requirements of the law that it goes to the root of the proceedings” (Wilde v The Queen (1988) 164 CLR 365 at 373). In each of these cases the accused was convicted and the court intervened to quash that conviction. Sometimes in these circumstances a trial has been referred to as a “nullity” although care must be exercised in the use of that expression. The practical effect may be confined to the fact that the conviction must be set aside in the event of an appeal: see Crane v Public Prosecutor (1921) 2 AC 299 and the discussion in Swansson v R; Henry v R [2007] NSWCCA 67. 
     
      
    22 In Tuckerman v Tuckerman (1932) 32 SR (NSW) 220 the Full Court cautioned against the granting of new trials where irregularities were found in the empanelling of the jury. Halse Rogers J referred to Hill v Yates (12 East. 229) where Lord Ellenborough CJ expressed the view that if, notwithstanding that there was an irregularity, no identifiable injustice was done, it was a matter for the discretion of the trial judge as to whether the jury should be discharged and an appeal court should not intervene.  
     
      
    23 In Tuckerman, although the jury had been struck “from properly qualified jurors”, the identified irregularity was that there was an excessive number of names of prospective jurors in the box from which the jurors’ names were drawn by the associate. The court described this as a “mere irregularity” and there being no prejudice said that “we are not prepared to say that such an irregularity is of such importance that subsequent proceedings are to be regarded as having taken place … coram non judice.”  
     
      
    24 In R v Smith [1954] QWN 49 a trial was regarded as a “nullity” because a challenge for cause had been wrongly determined by the judge and not by the jurors. In R v Hall [1971] VR 293 the trial judge directed the jury to try a challenge for cause when the judge himself was required by statute to try that challenge. The verdict was set aside. In R v Short (1898) 15 WN (NSW) 140 a juryman took ill and the remaining jurors were discharged but did not leave the jury box. Another juror was called and sworn but the other 11 were not resworn. The conviction was set aside. In R v Dempster [1924] SASR 299 a juror was chosen and empanelled but was not sworn. The trial proceeded and the jury returned a verdict. Before the trial judge had passed judgment the difficulty with the juror was discovered. The judge declined to pass judgment and ordered that the record should be amended so that all entries subsequent to the plea of not guilty up to and including the verdict should be expunged. 
     
      
    25 Johns v The Queen (1979) 141 CLR 409 concerned the situation where an accused person himself challenged a prospective juror but his counsel, without consulting the accused, informed the trial judge that there was no challenge. The High Court determined that the trial had miscarried and quashed the conviction.  
     
      
    26 In Maher v The Queen (1987) 163 CLR 221; 25 A Crim R 261 two charges were added to the indictment after the jury had been sworn. The jury was not resworn and the appellant was convicted on one of the added charges. It was determined that there had been a failure to comply with mandatory provisions and the conviction on the added count was set aside.  
     
      
    27 The High Court delivered one judgment saying, inter alia: 
     
      
       
        
        “The provisions of the  
        Jury Act 
         and of the Code which govern the constitution and authority of the jury as the tribunal of fact in a criminal trial are mandatory. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        A failure to comply with those provisions may render a trial a nullity, at least in the sense that the conviction produced cannot withstand an appeal: see  
        Crane v Public Prosecutor 
          
        (UK)  
        [1921] 2 AC 299).” 
        
       
      
    28 Mindful of the complexities in the concept of “nullity” the court said: 
     
      
       
        
        “In any event it involves such a miscarriage of justice as to require the conviction to be set aside.” 
        
       
      
    29 In Maher (at p 234) the court went onto say: 
     
      
       
        
        “The principle is clear. A jury must be sworn to try the issues joined between the Crown and the applicant on a count then appearing on an indictment. Here the jury found the applicant guilty of the offence charged in count 20, though it had not been sworn to try the issues on that count. A conviction founded on that verdict cannot stand. There was a failure to observe the requirements of the criminal process in a fundamental respect.” 
        
       
      
    30 In the time available to this Court no authority dealing with circumstances similar to the present case has been identified. However, in R v Brown and R v Tran (2004) 148 A Crim R 268 this Court considered the Jury Act in circumstances where a person became a member of a jury although they had mistakenly attended court on a day other than that provided in the summons to attend. Unbeknown to anyone that person became a member of the jury, although they were not a member of the panel summoned to attend on the day appointed for the trial. Accordingly, the juror was not a member of the panel provided for the accused’s trial. 
     
      
    31 This Court held that there had been a failure to comply with mandatory provisions of the Jury Act and the empanelling of the jury was invalid and ineffective and accordingly the trial was a nullity. The court did not accept an argument that the verdict could be saved by s 73(b) and the convictions were quashed. The question of whether the juror could have been discharged and an order made allowing the trial to continue pursuant to s 22 did not arise and was not considered. 
     
      
    32 Further significant statements of present relevance were made by the High Court in Katsuno v The Queen (1999) 199 CLR 40; 109 A Crim R 66. The problem in that case arose from the fact that the Director of Public Prosecutions was provided with information concerning persons listed on the jury panel at a time other than provided by the statute. A majority of the High Court held that the unlawful supply of such information did not vitiate the trial. Relevant statements of principle in that decision include: 
     
      
    · “the failure to observe mandatory provisions relating to the constitution and authority of the jury” are failures “to observe the requirements of the criminal process in a fundamental respect” ([35]) 
     
      
    · “a conviction simply cannot stand if the trial process is flawed in a fundamental respect.” ([35]) 
     
      
    · There will be a failure to observe the requirements of the criminal process in a fundamental respect if there has been a failure to comply with a mandatory provision relating to “the constitution and authority of the jury.” ([41]) 
     
      
    · Not every legislative provision is mandatory. However, provisions relating to the summoning and number of jurors are mandatory. [41]-[42] 
     
      
    · In Maher, Short and Dempster there was non-compliance with legislative or mandatory procedures which resulted in a person or persons sitting on the jury when not entitled to do so. In those circumstances there has been a relevant fundamental failure in the trial process. [43] 
     
      
    33 In the present case there has been a failure to comply with the Jury Act and although twelve members were sworn only eleven were qualified to serve on the jury. In these circumstances, but for any statutory provisions, this Court would conclude that s 19 had not been complied with and accordingly the trial involved a miscarriage of justice and any conviction would have to be set aside. Furthermore if, as has happened, the present irregularity was identified in the course of the trial, the judge would have no alternative but to discharge the disqualified juror. At common law that would have led inevitably to the discharge of the entire jury. 
     
      
    34 Although s 19 requires a jury of twelve the Act does not mandate that the jury’s verdict will only be valid if returned by a jury of that number. Section 22 of the Act provides that the trial judge may order that when a juror has been discharged the other jurors remain for “all the purposes of that trial.” Although s 22 refers to jurors who are incapable through illness of continuing to act it also expressly contemplates, without further elaboration, that the power may be exercised when a juror has been discharged “for any other reason.” 
     
      
    35 The High Court considered s 22 in Wu. In that case the juror was discharged as being unwell. Although the legitimacy of that decision was debated in the High Court the exercise by the trial judge of the power or discretion provided in s 22 was also considered. 
     
      
    36 Gleeson CJ and Hayne J said at at [21]-[22]: 
     
      
       
        
        “It may be accepted that a criminal trial by jury in New South Wales must begin before a jury of twelve. At common law if a juror died or was taken ill a fresh jury had to be sworn  
        Halsbury’s Laws of England  
        ,1st ed (1917) Vol 18, para 623, although it seems that sometimes the eleven remaining jurors were re-empanelled and a fresh juror sworn in the place of the disabled juror  
        R v Beere  
        (1843) 2 Mood & R 472 [174 ER 353]. But the whole purpose of s 22 is to provide that a trial can proceed before a jury despite the discharge of one or more of its members. That is, there can be a fair and lawful trial of an accused despite the discharge of a juror in the course of the proceedings. 
        
       
       
        
        In this case it is not shown that the trial judge erred in discharging the juror. There being no attack on the decision to proceed before the jury constituted by the remaining jurors, it is not necessary to examine that decision. Nevertheless, the cause for discharging the juror relating  
        only  
        to that juror and not affecting in any way the capacity of the remaining jurors to perform their task, there is no basis for doubting that it was appropriate to proceed as the trial judge did.” 
        
       
      
    37 Wu stands as authority for the proposition that when tried for a State offence, if the relevant circumstances arise and a proper decision is made pursuant to s 22, although the jury may be reduced below 12 persons contrary to s 19, any verdict which is returned will be valid. In the case of a Commonwealth offence, s 80 of the Constitution does not require that the verdict be returned by all of the original twelve jurors (Brownlee v The Queen (2001) 207 CLR 278). Accordingly, if a juror misbehaves or is incapable of continuing to act for relevant reasons in the course of the trial for the Commonwealth offence, although that juror may be discharged, it would not follow that the entire jury must be discharged. This may be contrasted with the position when a State Act provides for a verdict by a majority of the members of the jury. In those circumstances the statutory provision is of no effect, s 80 of the Constitution requiring that a verdict of guilty may only be entered on the unanimous decision of all members of the jury. (see Cheatle v The Queen (1993) 177 CLR 541). 
     
      
    38 From the preceding discussion it is apparent that s 22 is a significant intrusion into the right to trial by jury provided by the common law. It also operates to modify the otherwise mandatory requirements in s 19. However, it is not the only statutory intrusion of present relevance. Section 73 provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “The verdict of a jury shall not be affected or invalidated by reason only:  
         
         
        (a) that any member of the jury was disqualified from serving as a juror or ineligible to serve as a juror, 
         
         
        (b) of any omission, error or irregularity with respect to any supplementary jury roll, jury roll, card or summons prepared or issued for the purposes of this Act, 
         
         
        (c) that any juror was misnamed or misdescribed (where there is no question as to the juror’s identity).” 
        
       
      
    39 Although s 73(b) and (c) are important s 73(a) is of greater consequence. If a disqualified or ineligible person has been included in a jury roll and has been empanelled as a member of the jury, any verdict returned by that jury is not “affected or invalidated.” It is apparent that the legislature took this course out of a recognition that the preparation and maintenance of the roll was a complex task and that the presence of persons on it who were disqualified was almost inevitable. A person who, when first included on the roll may have been under no disqualification, could become so without recognising the consequence for the jury roll. If a verdict could be challenged and set aside in those circumstances considerable cost and inconvenience could be caused to both the person tried and to the State. It may be readily inferred that it was to avoid these difficulties that the section was enacted. 
     
      
    40 It would be surprising if in these circumstances the power in s 22 was confined in the manner contended for by the appellant. However, there is force in the submission that, because s 73 operates to modify the operation of the statute which otherwise requires a jury comprised of persons who are not disqualified or ineligible, it should be strictly construed. I also accept that because it says nothing about the discharge or otherwise of the jury if the problem is discovered in the course of the trial it is not of direct relevance to the construction of s 22. Nevertheless it confirms that the legislature was concerned that because the disqualification and ineligibility provisions were complex, and likely to be breached, the cost and inconvenience if verdicts could be set aside were unacceptable. 
     
      
    41 Although the common law provided for trial by a jury of 12 jurors the composition of the jury and the criteria by which the eligibility of potential jurors is determined is now provided by the State Jury Act. To my mind when the High Court speaks of “mandatory provisions” relating to the “constitution and authority of the jury” there is no reason to exclude s 22 from these provisions. Both s 19 and s 22 are to be found in Part 4 of the Act. The effect is that although the legislature has expressly provided that a jury must comprise twelve persons who are not disqualified a lawful verdict may be returned by a jury of less than 12 in circumstances falling within s 22 and provided that section is complied with. 
     
      
    42 It is the legislature in New South Wales which has determined that certain persons should be disqualified from being a member of a jury. Apart from a person in the circumstances of the “absent juror” a lengthy list of persons is disqualified or ineligible. It includes a person who is unable to read or understand English and persons who are unable because of sickness, infirmity or disability to discharge the duties of a juror (Schedule 2). It is not hard to imagine persons in either of these categories ending up on a jury. Persons who cannot read English commonly seek to mask their difficulties out of embarrassment. I cannot accept that the legislature did not intend that if a person with these difficulties found their way onto a jury and the difficulty was identified during the trial, particularly at a late stage of the trial, s 22 would not be available so that the juror could be discharged and the trial continue to a verdict. 
     
      
    43 The view I have reached in relation to s 22 is reinforced, although not conclusively, by s 73(a). The legislature recognised that on occasions persons who are disqualified or ineligible will become members of a jury and has legislated to preserve a verdict returned by such a jury. In these circumstances there is little justification for confining the operation of the words “for any other reason” to exclude the exercise of the power in the present circumstances. There would be no justification, either of policy or necessary construction, to exclude the discharge of a juror who, being disqualified, was discharged for that reason. 
     
      
    44 I appreciate that I have earlier referred to various decisions where a failure to observe a provision of the statute in relation to the constitution of a jury has caused the jury’s verdict to be quashed. In each of the cases the “problem” was not discovered until after the trial had concluded and in no case was a provision, such as s 73, available to protect the jury’s verdict from a successful challenge. Each of these decisions reflects a determination by the courts to ensure that where there is a defect in the constitution of the jury or its process, by reason of a failure to comply with the Act, a verdict cannot stand.  
     
      
    45 However, in Wu the High Court accepted that s 22 could operate to vary the otherwise mandatory requirements of s 19. Furthermore, the High Court in Brownlee concluded that s 22 was not incompatible with s 80 of the Constitution. If available to authorise a jury verdict returned by less than twelve jurors I can see no reason why s 22 should not be available in the present case. 
     
      
    46 Apart from the submission that the power provided by s 22 was not presently available no challenge was made to the trial judge’s consideration of whether to exercise the power. In the circumstances of this trial, which is a retrial of a complex series of charges which has already proceeded for a number of weeks, the reasons which his Honour gave for the exercise of the power under s 22 are compelling. 
     
      
    47 In my opinion the appeal should be dismissed. 
     
      
    48 SIMPSON J: Pursuant to a certificate issued under s 5F(3)(b) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 by Johnson J on 10 May 2007, the appellant appeals against an order of his Honour made on the same day. The order appealed against was made under s 22 of the Jury Act 1977. The substance and effect of the order is that a trial then in progress proceed with a jury of 11 members. 
     
      
    49 Since dictating these reasons, I have had the opportunity of reading in draft the judgment of McClellan CJ at CL. His Honour proposes that the appeal be dismissed. I have come to a different view. 
     
      
       
      History 
       
      
    50 The appellant is charged with three counts of offences against the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth). On 26 March 2007 a jury was empanelled and a trial began. It had an estimate of four months’ duration. It proceeded, with one hiccup, until 7 May. A number of important Crown witnesses have completed their evidence in chief and cross-examination. 
     
      
    51 On 7 May it was discovered that one member of the jury had, on 12 April 2002, and other occasions thereafter, been disqualified by court order from driving a motor vehicle. By s 6 and Sch 1 of the Jury Act the existence of such an order carries a further disqualification: disqualification from serving as a juror. 
     
      
    52 Johnson J was then called upon to decide what course to take. He determined (i) to discharge the juror and (ii) to proceed with a jury of 11. It is the latter decision that is the subject of the present appeal. 
     
      
    53 On behalf of the appellant it was submitted that proceeding with the trial with a jury of 11 members was not open to his Honour. Two strands of the argument were advanced: 
     
      
       
      (i) that s 80 of the Constitution of Australia mandates that trial of indictable offences against laws of the Commonwealth be by jury,  
      and  
      that, implicit in that mandate is a further mandate that the jury, at least at the commencement of the trial, be constituted by 12 qualified individuals; that is, that an essential feature of the “jury” envisaged in s 80 is that it be composed of that number of jurors; 
       
       
      (ii) that, in any event, the terms of the Jury Act do not permit, in these circumstances, the trial to proceed. 
       
      
    54 The first strand of the argument raises a question under the Constitution and, accordingly, notices to the Attorneys-General of the States, Territories, and the Commonwealth were issued under s 78B of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth). Only the Attorney-General for the State of NSW opted to participate in the appeal. 
     
      
    55 The second strand of the argument involves the construction of the Jury Act and is not dependent upon constitutional issues or questions. 
     
      
    56 I will return in due course to the constitutional issue. I am satisfied that the appeal turns upon the construction of certain provisions of the Jury Act. They are s 6 and Sch 1, and ss 19, 22 and 73(a). It is convenient to set out the relevant portions of those sections here.

        (c) that any juror was misnamed or misdescribed (where there is no question as to the juror’s identity).” 
        
       
      
    57 Trial of criminal charges by jury is an ancient part of the criminal justice system in all states and territories of this country. It has evolved over the years and centuries: see Wu v The Queen [1999] HCA 52; 199 CLR 99; R v Brownlee (1997) 41 NSWLR 139 at 142-144. 
     
      
    58 Historically, a jury was composed of 12 persons. Absent statutory intervention, a trial could not proceed with fewer than 12 jurors. The power (or discretion) to discharge a single juror and allow the trial to proceed with the remainder derives (in part, by necessary implication only – the power or discretion to discharge a single juror is not explicitly spelled out) from s 22. That the power or discretion exists to continue a trial with a jury made up of fewer than 12 jurors cannot be doubted. This is explicit in the terms of s 22. It applies equally to trials conducted in NSW courts for offences against Commonwealth law: R v Brownlee (2001) HCA 36; 207 CLR 278. 
     
      
    59 The basis upon which a decision to discharge a single juror may be made is as wide as it can be possibly be – for incapacity caused by illness “or for any other reason”. Here, the reason is as compelling as it can possibly be: “the juror” was disqualified from serving. He ought never to have been empanelled. Indeed, his name ought not to have been on the jury roll: see Jury Act, s 14. That, however, is not the present issue.  
     
      
    60 A decision under s 22 involves not one, but two, steps: the decision to discharge the single juror, and the decision (which must be the subject of an order) that: 
     
      
       
        
        “… the jury shall be considered as remaining for all the purposes of that trial … properly constituted …”: 
        
       
       
      see  
      Wu  
      (supra) 
       
       
      The present issue concerns whether it was open to the trial judge to make that further order. 
       
      
    61 I have come to the conclusion that it was not. Section 19 is explicit in its terms: a jury in a criminal trial is to consist of 12 persons returned and selected in accordance with the Jury Act. This jury was not returned and selected in accordance with the Jury Act. It included one member (purported member) who was disqualified from serving. The trial process was flawed from the outset. 
     
      
       
      Can s 73(a) save the trial? 
       
      
    62 Only one argument can avail the Crown, in its support of the decision of the trial judge. It is that s 73(a) is to be read as including, not merely the preservation of a verdict in which a disqualified person participated, but also the preservation of an unconcluded trial subject to the same defect. This is an argument that found favour with Johnson J. I respectfully disagree. In my opinion s 73(a) cannot be read as going so far. Section 73(a) is, in my opinion, a quite extraordinary provision. It overrides the entitlement of an accused person to the verdict of a jury constituted in accordance with the requirements of the Jury Act – that is a jury from which are excluded all persons who were disqualified from serving or ineligible to serve as jurors. Because of its extraordinary nature it ought not to be interpreted as going beyond its terms. Johnson J applied the well-known maxim “the greater includes the lesser” to reach a contrary view, that is, that s 73(a) denotes an intention on the part of the NSW legislature to preserve a trial in which the defect in the jury constitution is discovered before verdict.  
     
      
    63 I acknowledge the practical benefit and attractiveness of this argument. Discharge of the disqualified person could be seen to achieve, in substance, what the legislature sought to achieve by the disqualification provisions – that is, that no disqualified person will participate in the verdict. 
     
      
    64 However, that does not overcome the problem that the explicit requirement of s 19 has not been met: that is, that the jury be returned and selected in accordance with the provisions of the Jury Act. That is, in my opinion, a mandatory requirement. Section 73(a) cannot, in my opinion, be broadened to incorporate a concept that simply is not present.  
     
      
    65 In enacting s 73(a) (and, indeed, the other sub-paras of s 73) the legislature turned its mind to the consequences of a disqualified or ineligible person finding his or her way onto a jury. It cannot have been blind to the possibility that the defect or disqualification would have been discovered prior to verdict. Yet it opted to make no equivalent provision to cover that circumstance. 
     
      
    66 In my opinion, to excuse non-compliance with a mandatory or fundamental requirement concerning the composition of the jury would require express statutory provision. There is no such provision. 
     
      
    67 I have considered whether s 22 is adequate, even without s 73(a), to permit the course taken by Johnson J. (This, as I understand it, is the approach taken by the Chief Judge.) I am satisfied that it is not. That is, largely, because of the terms of s 19. Section 22 is predicated upon the jury having been returned and selected in accordance with the Jury Act. The reasons for discharge that it envisages are open-ended, but do not, in my view encompass the circumstance that one purported member of the jury was not qualified to serve. 
     
      
    68 The view to which I have come is in accord with observations made by members of the High Court. In Maher v The Queen [1987] HCA 31; 163 CLR 221, in considering an irregularity in a trial of offences against both Queensland and Commonwealth law, the High Court said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The provisions of the Jury Act [the Jury Act 1929-1981 (Q)] and of the Code [the Criminal Code (Q)] which govern the constitution and authority of the jury as the tribunal of fact in a criminal trial are mandatory, for the entitlement to trial by jury which s 604 of the Code confirms is trial by a jury constituted in accordance with the Jury Act and authorised by law to try the issues raised by the plea of not guilty. A failure to comply with those provisions may render a trial a nullity, at least in the sense that the conviction produced cannot withstand an appeal: see  
        Crane v Public Prosecutor  
        [[1921] 2 AC 299]. In any event it involves such a miscarriage of justice as to require the conviction to be set aside.” 
        
       
      
    69 In Katsuno v The Queen [1999] HCA 50; 199 CLR 40 (a case the facts of which have no bearing on the present case), Gaudron, Gummow and Callinan JJ said: 
     
      
       
        
        “At one level, the decisions in  
        Maher  
        and  
        Johns  
        [ 
        Johns (Roger) v The Queen  
        (1978) 141 CLR 409] 
         are concerned with failure to comply with mandatory legislative provisions relating to the constitution and authority of the jury. At another, as is clear from the judgment of the Court in  
        Maher 
        , they are concerned with ‘failure to observe the requirements of the criminal process in a fundamental respect of which the failure to observe mandatory provisions relating to the constitution and authority of the jury is but an example. A conviction simply cannot stand if the trial process is flawed in a fundamental respect.” 
        
       
       
      If a conviction following trial flawed in a fundamental respect cannot survive, then, axiomatically, it is not open to a judge to decide to proceed with the trial after the defect is discovered. 
       
      
    70 On this basis the appeal should be allowed. 
     
      
       
      The constitutional issue 
       
      
    71 Section 80 of the Australian Constitution provides as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “80 The trial on indictment of any offence against any law of the Commonwealth shall be by jury, and every such trial shall be held in the State where the offence was committed …” 
        
       
      
    72 By s 68 of the Judiciary Act the laws of States or Territories concerning, inter alia, the trial and conviction on indictment of persons charged with offences against the law of the Commonwealth apply to the conduct of trials of those offences. The Jury Act applies to the conduct of the present trial. 
     
      
    73 In Cheatle v The Queen [1993] HCA 44; 177 CLR 541 the High Court held, however, that a provision of the Juries Act 1927 (SA), which authorised majority verdicts in certain circumstances in trials conducted in that State, nevertheless did not authorise majority verdicts in trials of offences against Commonwealth law. That was because unanimity was an essential feature of trial by jury at the time of the adoption of the Constitution and that was not amenable to modification by State statute. This does not mean that, in order to comply with the “essential” requirements of s 80, a jury must consist of 12 members. In Brownlee the Court held that s 22 of the Jury Act authorised reduction of the numbers of members of the jury to 10, not only in respect of trials of offences against state laws, but also of charges brought under Commonwealth laws.  
     
      
    74 This was held to be not inconsistent with the requirements of s 80. Some reservations were expressed concerning whether a further reduction to fewer than that number might exceed the bounds permitted by s 80. (It was because of the decision in Brownlee that the argument advanced on behalf of the appellant had to recognize that the proposed “essential feature” (that the trial commenced with a jury of 12) was so limited – Brownlee precludes an argument that s 80 envisages a verdict of a jury of 12. 
     
      
    75 The question posed in the majority judgment (Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ) was: 
     
      
       
        
        “… whether laws in the terms of s 22(a)(i) … of the Jury Act are compatible with the command in s 80 of the Constitution.” 
        
       
       
      or what was encompassed by: 
       
       
        
        “… the essential features of a trial by jury.” 
        
       
       
      as mandated by s 80. 
       
      
    76 The consequence of the decisions in Cheatle and Brownlee is that unanimity is an essential requirement; that the verdict be that of a jury composed of 12 members is not. 
     
      
    77 Nevertheless, counsel who appeared for the appellant sought to persuade the Court that “the essential features of a trial by jury” include 12 members (at the outset of the trial). The argument depended upon the fact (which is clearly correct) that the appellant’s trial, while it had the appearance of commencing with 12 (qualified) jurors, in fact commenced with only 11, because one was disqualified from serving.  
     
      
    78 Brownlee persuades me that the fundamental premise of the argument is wrong. A jury in a Commonwealth trial may be made up of such numbers (at least, provided it is not less than 10) as the local law provides. If a state Jury Act provided for juries made up of 10 persons, or of 14 persons, there would be no inconsistency with the requirements of s 80. The flaw in the present trial lies not in any departure from constitutional requirements, but in the departure from the standards prescribed by NSW statute. There is no merit in the constitutional argument. 
     
      
    79 I would nevertheless, for the reasons I have given above, allow the appeal.  
     
      
    80 That raises the question what orders this Court ought to make. The orders sought on behalf of the appellant are: 
     
      
       
        
        “1 That judgment (No 17) of Johnson J of 10 May 1007 be set aside. 
         
         
        2 That the jury be discharged. 
         
         
        3 That a new trial be ordered. 
         
         
        4 Such other orders as the Court sees fit.” 
        
       
      
    81 Section 5F(5) provides for the powers of this Court following an appeal under s 5F: it is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “(5) The Court of Criminal Appeal: 
         
          
          (a) may affirm or vacate the judgment, order, decision or ruling appealed against, and 
           
          (b) if it vacates the judgment, order, decision or ruling, may give or make some other judgment, order, decision or ruling instead of the judgment, order, decision or ruling appealed against.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    82 Accordingly, I propose that this Court make the following orders: 
     
      
       
      (1) The judgment of Johnson J of 10 May 2007 is vacated; 
       
       
      (2) The jury empanelled in the trial of R v Petroulias be discharged; 
       
      
    83 HOEBEN J: I agree with Simpson J and the orders which her Honour proposes. 
     
      
    84 I also agree with McClellan CJ at CL that s 22 of the Jury Act 1977 has a wide application except that for the reasons given by Simpson J it cannot apply to the facts of this appeal. By way of illustration, I see no reason why s 22 could not save a trial where a person was empanelled as a member of a jury and after commencement of the trial but before verdict became disqualified.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 JAMES J: This is an appeal by the Crown pursuant to s 5DA of the Criminal Appeal Act against a sentence imposed on the respondent which was reduced because the respondent undertook to assist law enforcement authorities, on the grounds that the respondent failed to fulfil his undertaking. The offence for which the respondent was sentenced was supplying 8.12 grams of a prohibited drug methylamphetamine on 28 July 2001. The respondent entered a plea of guilty to the offence.  
     
      
    2 On 24 April 2003 his Honour Judge Solomon of the District Court sentenced the respondent to a term of imprisonment of three years, with a non-parole period of two years three months, and ordered that the sentence be served by way of periodic detention. 
     
      
    3 After the sentence was imposed a complicated series of events occurred, including revocations of the order that the term of imprisonment be served by way of periodic detention, a rescission of a revocation order and the conviction of the respondent for further offences. It is unnecessary to go into the detail of these events. 
     
      
    4 The respondent sought to appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal against the sentence imposed by Judge Solomon. On 22 December 2005 the reserved judgments of the members of the Court of Criminal Appeal were delivered. The Court of Criminal Appeal granted the respondent an extension of time in which to apply for leave to appeal against sentence, granted the respondent leave to appeal and allowed the appeal and remitted the proceedings to the District Court for the re-sentencing of the respondent in accordance with the Court of Criminal Appeal’s judgment. 
     
      
    5 The ground on which the Court of Criminal Appeal allowed the appeal was that Judge Solomon in sentencing the respondent had made an order that the sentence be served by way of periodic detention, without first having considered the length of the term of the sentence which should be imposed. See R v Zamagias [2002] NSWCCA 17. The sentencing judge’s omission to consider the length of the term of the sentence which should be imposed, before making an order that the sentence be served by way of periodic detention, had led to the imposition of a sentence which in the length of its term was manifestly excessive.  
     
      
    6 After the respondent’s successful appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal, the respondent came before Judge Solomon again for re-sentencing. 
     
      
    7 In remarks on sentence delivered on 10 March 2006 Judge Solomon noted that since he had first sentenced the respondent, the respondent had served 15 weeks of periodic detention and had served 43 days in custody after a revocation of the order for periodic detention.  
     
      
    8 His Honour devoted part of his remarks on sentence of 10 March 2006 to the subject of assistance provided and to be provided by the respondent to law enforcement authorities. 
     
      
    9 In 2004 the respondent had made statements to police giving an eyewitness account of a shooting and attempted murder on 8 May 2004 of a man named Michael Darwiche. In the statements the respondent identified the persons who had shot at Michael Darwiche as being three members of the Razzak family, whom the respondent knew and named.  
     
      
    10 In a letter placed before Judge Solomon on 10 March 2006 a high ranking police officer expressed the view that, without the assistance of the respondent, it would have been unlikely that the three persons named by the respondent would have been charged.  
     
      
    11 In his remarks on sentence of 10 March 2006 Judge Solomon also referred to an affidavit by the respondent which had been filed in the Court of Criminal Appeal in support of the respondent’s appeal against the first sentence, in which the respondent had deposed to the fear he had for his own safety as a result of the assistance he had given.  
     
      
    12 His Honour concluded this part of his remarks on sentence by saying:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Insofar as the assistance is concerned, it is of the highest order. A serious crime may have been solved with the assistance of the offender. The offender is prepared to give evidence. In addition, the offender’s life is in jeopardy as a result of the assistance previously given and as a result of the assistance he will give. He is entitled to a discount of at least 50 per cent.” 
        
       
      
    13 In his remarks on sentence Judge Solomon referred to the respondent’s plea of guilty and found that the plea of guilty had utilitarian value and also evinced some contrition. 
     
      
    14 Judge Solomon accepted a submission by counsel for the respondent in the proceedings on sentence that an appropriate putative sentence would be a sentence of two years. Allowing a discount of 50 per cent would reduce the putative sentence to a sentence of one year. His Honour found special circumstances and divided the term of one year into a non-parole period of six months and a balance of term of six months. His Honour then made an order under s 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act suspending the execution of the whole of the sentence. 
     
      
    15 His Honour did not in his remarks on sentence quantify the amount of the part of the discount for assistance which related to future assistance and he did not state any reason for suspending the sentence.16 The trial of the three members of the Razzak family on charges arising out of the shooting and attempted murder of Michael Darwiche took place in June 2006. The respondent was called as a witness for the Crown at the trial. The transcript of the respondent’s evidence at the trial covers many pages but it is sufficient, for the purposes of this appeal, to note that the respondent claimed that he could not remember what had happened on 8 May 2004. Leave was given to the Crown to cross-examine the respondent and the respondent was cross-examined on the statements he had made to police. In general, the respondent said that he could not recall saying what appeared in his statements and could not remember what had actually happened. 
     
      
    17 A statement by a police officer was put before this Court. According to the statement, the respondent, after the trial in the District Court had been adjourned on the first day the respondent was giving evidence, telephoned the police officer and arranged a meeting with the police officer. At the meeting with the police officer the respondent said “I can remember what happened but I’m so scared”. The respondent claimed to the police officer that he had been physically assaulted four times over the preceding few months and he blamed those assaults on members of the Razzak family. 18 After the respondent had completed giving evidence, the trial in June 2006 was aborted, for reasons unconnected with the respondent.  
     
      
    19 On 12 July 2006 the present appeal by the Crown was commenced. The only ground in the Notice of Appeal is that the respondent received a reduced sentence because of his undertaking to assist law enforcement authorities and he failed to fulfil that undertaking.  
     
      
    20 The appeal by the Crown came before a differently constituted Court of Criminal Appeal on 15 December 2006. On 15 December 2006 the appeal was adjourned, on the application of the respondent, on the grounds that a new trial of the three members of the Razzak family had been fixed for February 2007, the respondent had been served with a subpoena to give evidence at the new trial and the respondent had indicated that he was prepared to give evidence at the new trial in fulfilment of his undertaking to provide assistance.  
     
      
    21 The new trial of the three members of the Razzak family was held in February 2007. The respondent was called as a witness for the Crown and gave evidence on 15 and 16 February 2007. This Court was not informed of the outcome of this second trial. 
     
      
    22 A transcript of the respondent’s evidence at the second trial was put before this Court. It is unclear whether this is a transcript of the whole of the respondent’s evidence. 
     
      
    23 In his evidence at the second trial the respondent said that he and Michael Darwiche had been shot at on 8 May 2004. However, he asserted that “I didn’t see it because I just went straight away down”. He said that all he had seen had been the approaching car from which the shots were fired.  
     
      
    24 The Crown was granted leave to cross-examine the respondent and the respondent was cross-examined on the statements he had made to police. The respondent admitted that he had made the statements but said that some of the contents of the statements were untrue and, in particular, it was not true that he had seen who did the shooting. 
     
      
    25 The respondent was also cross-examined on an affidavit by him, which had been filed in support of his appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal and in which particulars of the assistance he had provided and had undertaken to provide were given, including the making of statements in which he had identified the persons who had done the shooting. 
     
      
    26 The respondent was also cross-examined about an undertaking to give evidence on which he had relied when being re-sentenced by Judge Solomon. In the undertaking he had undertaken to give evidence against the three named members of the Razzak family and had sworn that the contents of the statements he had made to police in 2004 were true.  
     
      
    27 The respondent continued to maintain in his evidence at the second trial that not everything in the statements he had made to police in 2004 was true.  
     
      
       
      Decision 
      
    28 Section 5DA of the Criminal Appeal Act provides, so far as is relevant:- 
     
      
       
        
        “5DA Appeal by Crown against reduced sentence for assistance to authorities 
         
         
        (1) The Attorney General or the Director of Public Prosecutions may appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal against any sentence imposed on a person that was reduced because the person undertook to assist law enforcement authorities if the person fails wholly or partly to fulfil the undertaking. 
         
         
        (2) On an appeal the Court of Criminal Appeal may, if it is satisfied that the person has failed wholly or partly to fulfil the undertaking, vary the sentence and impose such sentence as it thinks fit.” 
        
       
      
    29 The principles to be applied on an appeal under s 5DA of the Criminal Appeal Act have been stated in a number of cases including R v O’Brien (NSWCCA unreported 10 June 1993), R v El-Sayed (2003) 57 NSWLR 659, R v Waqa (2004) 149 A Crim R 143, R v KS [2005] NSWCCA 87, R v Chaaban [2006] NSWCCA 352. These principles include:- 
     
      
       
        
        “The purpose of section 5DA is not punitive. The purpose is to enable this Court in an appropriate case, and to an appropriate extent, to intervene to adjust or correct a sentence where the sentencing process can be seen, with the benefit of hindsight, to have miscarried by reason of the circumstances set out in the section.” ( 
        O’Brien 
         per Gleeson CJ at [2]) 
        
       
       
        
        “If the assistance and in particular the evidence, is not forthcoming, the discount has been obtained on an expectation which has not been fulfilled and the basis for the reduced sentence is removed. It is in these circumstances that s5DA allows the sentence to be varied to that which would have been imposed, subject always to the Court’s discretion not to intervene where circumstances justify such a course…” ( 
        Waqa 
         at 147 [24] per Dunford J). 
        
       
       
        
        “…s5DA only authorises this Court to review the sentence where there has been breach of an undertaking to provide future assistance. In other words, where a discount has been allowed for the provision of past assistance and an undertaking to provide future assistance, and there is subsequently a breach of the undertaking to provide future assistance, this Court can adjust the sentence on account of the breach of that undertaking, but cannot interfere with that part of the reduction that has been allowed on account of the past assistance.” ( 
        Waqa 
         at 147-148 [26] per Dunford J) 
        
       
       
        
        “In the event that the contemplated assistance is not given, s5DA provides a mechanism that allows the discount to be excised. It does not admit of reviewing the sentence generally…” ( 
        Chaaban 
         at [52] per Bell J). 
        
       
       
        
        “The ability of the Crown to invoke this section is a very important part of the criminal justice system. Persons who give undertakings and who receive the benefit of those undertakings by way of a discounted sentence can, subject to exceptional circumstances, expect to have their sentences increased if they renege on their undertaking to give evidence. The departure from an undertaking of that kind is not to be regarded lightly and it will normally justify appellate intervention.” ( 
        KS 
         at [19] per Wood CJ at CL). 
        
       
      
    30 In general, the fact that the offender’s reason for not honouring his undertaking to give assistance is a justified fear for his safety if he does so, is not a sufficient reason for the Court of Criminal Appeal to decline to intervene. The reasons why this should be so were well stated by Simpson J in El-Sayed at 66 [32-35]. There is an exception to this general rule where the authorities have neglected to take reasonable measures to protect the offender from reprisals (R v Bagnall & Russell CCA unreported 10 June 1994) and there may possibly be other exceptions. 
     
      
    31 I will now seek to apply these principles to the present case. 
     
      
    32 The power of the Court, if it intervened, would be limited to increasing the sentence by excising that part of the combined discount of 50 per cent which related to the undertaking to provide future assistance. The Court has no power to review the sentence generally. In particular, the Court has no power to review the term of the sentence before any discount is allowed, the amount of the combined discount, the proportions in which the sentence is divided between a non-parole period and a balance of the term or the order that the execution of the sentence be suspended.  
     
      
    33 I accept that the respondent genuinely fears for his safety if he gives evidence in accordance with his undertaking but, as the authorities show, this will not usually be a sufficient reason for this Court declining to intervene. As has been indicated earlier in this judgment, a finding by Judge Solomon that the respondent’s life was in jeopardy as a result of the assistance previously given and the assistance he had undertaken to give, formed an important reason for Judge Solomon deciding to allow such a high discount for assistance. The circumstances of the present case are far removed from the circumstances which existed in Bagnall & Russell and I do not consider that it has been shown that the authorities have neglected to take reasonable measures to protect the respondent.  
     
      
    34 I have, however, concluded that, notwithstanding the important policy consideration stated by Wood CJ at CL in KS, this Court, in the exercise of its discretion, should not intervene in the present appeal.  
     
      
    35 The sentencing judge did not in his remarks on sentence quantify the amount of the part of the combined discount which related to future assistance. This Court has said on a number of occasions that the amount of any discount for future assistance should be quantified, so as to facilitate the determination of any appeal by the Crown under s 5DA. See for example, Waqa at 148 [27]. The omission by the sentencing judge to quantify the amount of the part of the combined discount which related to future assistance does not prevent this Court intervening but does render it more difficult for this Court to determine to what extent, if at all, it should intervene. 
     
      
    36 It is difficult to determine how much of the discount of one year allowed by the sentencing judge should be allocated to future assistance. The past assistance provided by the respondent had utility in that it led to the apprehension and charging of the members of the Razzak family. On the other hand, it can be contended that the past assistance had only limited value, unless the respondent gave evidence at a trial incriminating the members of the Razzak family. 
     
      
    37 A further complicating factor is that it is left unclear in the remarks on sentence of 10 March 2006 whether the discount of 50 per cent also included an amount for the respondent’s plea of guilty.  
     
      
    38 Whatever amount of the combined discount of one year is allocated to the undertaking to provide future assistance, it would not exceed a few months, which would then have to be divided half and half between the non-parole period and the balance of the sentence and which would all become subject to the order suspending the execution of the sentence. 
     
      
    39 Other reasons for this Court exercising its discretion so as not to intervene are the staleness of the respondent’s offence and the protracted criminal proceedings to which the respondent has been subjected. The offence was committed nearly six years ago, when the respondent was 18 years old. He was first sentenced for the offence more than four years ago. He was last sentenced for the offence more than a year ago and more than a year has elapsed since a sentence with a term of one year was imposed. There have also been two appeals to the Court of Criminal Appeal. 
     
      
    40 In my opinion, this Court should, in the exercise of its discretion, dismiss the Crown appeal.

       Inspector Mark Barber  
       
       
       
       JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: The first issue raised in this case concerns the sufficiency of two Court attendance notices (“CANS”) filed in the Chief Industrial Magistrates Court on 5 August 2005. Neither of the filed CANS contains a statement in the terms required by s 175(3)(e) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (the CP Act).  
     
      
    2 Section 175(3)(e) provides: 
     
      
       
        
         
          
          “(3) A court attendance Notice must do the following: 
          
         
        
       
      
     ………… 
     
      
       
        
         
          
          (e) state, unless a warrant is issued for the arrest of the person or the person is refused bail, that failure to appear may result in the arrest of the person or in the matter being dealt with in the absence of the person.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    3 The plaintiff is being prosecuted by the WorkCover Authority of New South Wales for alleged breaches on 11 August 2003 pursuant to ss 8(1) and 8(2) of the Occupational Health and Safety Act 2000 by virtue of s 26(1) of that Act. The first defendant is an inspector employed by WorkCover and is the prosecutor.  
     
      
    4 The maximum penalty for an offence in the case of an individual (being a previous offender) is 750 penalty units or imprisonment for 2 years, or both, or in the case of an individual (not being a previous offender) 500 penalty units: s12 of the Occupational Health and Safety Act 2000. Being proceedings in a lower court for an offence, Chapter 4, Part 2 Division 1 of the CP Act applies.  
     
      
    5 Pleas of not guilty to each charge were entered by the plaintiff and were listed for hearing on 22 May 2006. At the outset of the hearing the plaintiff argued that the Chief Industrial Magistrate did not have jurisdiction to hear the proceedings as the filed CANS did not comply with s 175(3)(e) of the  
     
      
      CP Act. The Chief Industrial Magistrate disagreed and in written reasons delivered on 15 August 2006 determined that the filed CANS were valid and prescribed forms of court attendance notice. 
       
      
    6 By way of an amended summons, the plaintiff seeks declarations that proceedings with respect to each CAN were not commenced within the time prescribed by s 107 of the Occupational Health and Safety Act and that the Chief Industrial Magistrate’s Court is without jurisdiction to hear the proceedings. The second defendant is the Chief Industrial Magistrate.  
     
      
    7 The plaintiff contends that compliance with s 175 of the CP Act is mandatory. The failure to file a CAN which includes the statement required by s 175(3)(e) of the CP Act, the plaintiff submits, amounts to a non-compliance with an essential preliminary to the commencement of criminal proceedings. The consequence of the failure is that the Chief Industrial Magistrate does not have jurisdiction to hear the matters.  
     
      
    8 An analogy is drawn by the plaintiff to the provisions of s 177 of the CP Act which were considered in Sharman v Director of Public Prosecutions [2006] NSWSC 135. The issue in that case was whether proceedings for offences including negligent driving occasioning death contrary to s42(1)(a) of the Road Transport (Safety and Traffic Management) Act 1999 were validly commenced within time as copies of the court attendance notices containing an endorsement as to service were not filed in the registry of the court within the limitation period prescribed by s 177(4) of the CP Act. Bell J said [at 39]: 
     
      
       
        
         
          
          “The Criminal Procedure Amendment (Justices and Local Courts) Act introduced a completely new scheme with respect of the commencement of criminal proceedings. The subject matter of the Act is the conduct of criminal proceedings both summary and on indictment. The Division is concerned with the commencement of proceedings for summary offences, including proceedings for indictable offences that are to be dealt with summarily: s170(1). Proceedings for summary offences are to be commenced by the issue and filing of a court attendance notice in accordance with the Division. All proceedings are taken to have commenced on the date on which a court attendance notice is filed in the registry of a relevant court in accordance with the Division. The language of s 177(4) is imperative. In my opinion it cannot be read disjunctively as requiring as a condition of the commencement of proceedings that a copy of the court attendance notice be filed and, separately, making provision for the filing of a copy of the court attendance notice that contains an endorsement as to service.” 
          
         
        
       
       
       
      As a consequence of the failure to comply with s 177(4) of the CP Act, her Honour declared that the proceedings were not commenced within time and the Local Court was without jurisdiction to hear them. 
       
      
    9 The plaintiff submits that ss 175 and 177 of the CP Act both employ the word “must” and, as both provisions appear in Chapter 4, Part 2 Division 1, they should be construed consistently. If the requirements of s 177(4) are mandatory as held by Bell J in Sharman, the plaintiff contends that the requirements of s 175(3) are also mandatory. It is to be noted that s 177 of the CP Act was amended on 29 November 2006 by the Crimes and Courts Legislation Amendment Act 2006.  
     
      
    10 The first defendant (hereinafter referred to as the prosecutor) submits that Sharman is to be distinguished as her Honour was dealing there with the issue of whether the proceedings had been properly commenced under s 178 of the CP Act by the filing of a copy CAN, as was then required under s 177(4) of the CP Act.  
     
      
    11 In the present case, each CAN was served on 1 August 2005 and filed on 5 August 2005. No issue as to filing within seven days therefore arises. It is not in dispute that the CANS were filed within seven days.  
     
      
    12 A further contention for the plaintiff is that his Honour erred by finding that there were two prescribed forms [of CANS] for use, whereas the plaintiff argues neither the 2000 nor the 2005 regulations (sic) contained any prescribed form of CAN. 
     
      
    13 In response, the prosecutor notes that ss 175(1) and (2) of the CP Act refer only to rules, not regulations and contends it well established pursuant to rules 59(2) and (3) of the Local Courts (Criminal and Application Procedure) Rule 2003 that the CANS filed in the present proceedings comply with the requirements of the Act and the rules as to form.  
     
      
    14 The following provisions in Chapter 4, Part 2 Division 1 of the CP Act were in force at the time of filing of the CANS: 
     
      
       
        
         
          
          “

            (b) to an indictable offence that has been dealt with summarily. 
            
           
          
         
        
       
      
    15 The Occupational Health and Safety Act specifies that proceedings for an offence against that Act may be instituted within the period of two years after the act or omission alleged to constitute the offence, except as otherwise provided by s 107 or s 107A of the Act. As the offences are alleged to have been committed on 11 August 2003, the time for instituting the proceedings expired on 10 August 2005. Although the CANS were filed on 5 August 2005, the plaintiff contends that the proceedings were not validly instituted.  
     
      
    16 Before the Chief Industrial Magistrate were two forms of CAN each headed “FOR GENERIC USE”. In his reasons, his Honour sedulously detailed (at paras 10-12) variations in the two forms one of which is referred to as a “Court/Service Copy” and the other as a “Defendant Copy”. As was identified by his Honour the major variations between the forms are found on the second page. The Defendant Copy bears a section entitled INFORMATION FOR THE DEFENDANT, which is not included in the Court/Service Copy. His Honour was satisfied that the warning in paragraph 3 of that section met the requirements of s 175(3)(e) of the CP Act. No issue is taken with this finding, which is clearly correct. A section headed STATEMENT OF SERVICE appears, as the Chief Industrial Magistrate pointed out, on the Court/Service Copy whereas it does not on the Defendant Copy. His Honour had earlier found that an examination of the “prescribed forms” set out within the regulations to the Act revealed that these forms were “two separate prescribed forms for use in this jurisdiction”(emphasis added). 
     
      
    17 In accordance with s 175(1) of the CP Act a CAN must be in writing and be in the form prescribed by the rules. The rules may prescribe one or more forms of CAN: s 175(2). 
     
      
    18 Section 3 of the CP Act 1986 defines “rules” as meaning: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        Rules 
         made for the purposes of a court to which the relevant provision applies.”  
        
       
      
    19 The relevant “rules” for the purpose of s 175 of the CP Act are those under the Local Courts (Criminal and Applications Procedure) Rule 2003. 
     
      
    20 An “approved form” is defined in clause 3 of that Rule to mean in relation to a document: 
     
      
       
        
        “………the form approved for that document by the Chief Magistrate under clause 59 from time to time”. 
        
       
      
    21 Clause 59 provided prior to being amended on 30 March 2007: 
     
      
       
      “Forms  
       
       
        
        59(1) The Chief Magistrate may from time to time cause to be published in the Gazette approved forms for the purpose of this Rule. 
         
        (2) If there is no approved form for a document required to be filed in any proceedings in a Court, the registrar of the Court may approve the form of the document.  
         
        (3) Strict compliance with an approved form is not necessary but substantial compliance is sufficient.” 
        
       
      
    22 It seems that no approved form of CAN has been published in the Gazette. The two forms of CAN identified by the Chief Industrial Magistrate have been in use in the Chief Industrial Magistrates Court and Local Courts generally since July 2003.  
     
      
    23 The two CANS filed in the present proceedings are Court/Service CANS. It was open to the prosecution to introduce evidence of approval of the form of the CANS by the registrar of the Chief Industrial Magistrate’s Court but no such evidence was led. As a consequence, there was no evidence available to his Honour to permit a finding that either form of CAN was a form prescribed by the rules for use in the Chief Industrial Magistrates Court. 
     
      
    24 In Knaggs v Director of Public Prosecutions & Anor [2007] NSWCA 83, a similar issue was considered by the Court of Appeal. Campbell JA, with whom Mason P and Tobias JA agreed, observed [at 22-23]: 
     
      
       
        
        “22. No approved form of CAN has been published in the Gazette. A form of CAN had been approved by the Chief Magistrate at some time prior to 13 June 2003 (the date on which the Rules were made) has been published on the Local Courts official website, and has been in use throughout Local Court’s since July 2003….. 
        
       
       
        
        23. There is no evidence that that form has been approved by the registrar (as opposed to the Chief Magistrate) of the Local Court. I conclude that the permission given by section 175(2) for the rules to prescribe one or more forms of CAN has not been acted upon, and that the requirement in section 175(1) that the CAN “be in the form prescribed by the rules” does not presently have any content.” 
        
       
      
    25 It is not in dispute that the filed CANS comply with the requirements of subss 175(3)(a)-(d) of the CP Act. Non-compliance with s 175 does not, however, necessarily lead to a conclusion that the Chief Industrial Magistrate lacks jurisdiction. In Knaggs the Court of Appeal held that a contravention of s 175(3)(b) did not result in the invalidity of the CAN and of any convictions that result in proceedings commenced by such a CAN. 
     
      
    26 A principal contention for the plaintiff is that ss 175 and 177 of the CP Act both employ the word “must” and should be construed consistently in accordance with “Sharman”. The imperfection in that reasoning is manifested by the appearance of the word “must” in s 175(1). 
     
      
    27 As was said by Campbell JA in Knaggs [at 53]: 
     
      
       
        
        “……….another aid to construction is that the word “ 
        must 
        ” appears in both section 175(1) and in section 175(3). Section 175(1) states that a CAN “ 
        must 
        ” be in the form prescribed by the rules - yet section 175(2) confers a mere permission for the rules to prescribe court forms, rather than a positive requirement. The form of the legislation therefore left open the possibility, which has in fact happened, that there is no prescribed form. It would be strange if a failure to comply with section 175(1), through not using “ 
        the form prescribed by the rules 
        ” for a CAN, made that CAN void. Indeed, if that were so, every CAN that the Local Court has issued since the commencement of section 175 would be void, all convictions obtained pursuant to proceedings commenced by such a CAN would be void, and all acquittals obtained in proceedings commenced by such a CAN would be likewise void and so would not give rise to a defence of  
        autrefois acquit. 
         I doubt that the legislature is likely to have intended those consequences. If a failure to comply with what section 175(1) says “ 
        must 
        ” be done does not necessarily result in invalidity of the CAN, that suggests that failure to comply with what section 175(3) says “ 
        must 
        ” be done does not necessarily result in invalidity of the CAN either”.  
        
       
      
    28 It is well established that a failure to comply with a legislative requirement that some act must be done in a particular way does not necessarily result in invalidity. The test for determining the issue of validity is to ask whether it was a purpose of the legislation that an act done in breach of the provision should be invalid: see Project Blue Sky Inc & Others v Australian Broadcasting Authority (1998) 194 CLR 355 at 388-390. There are, as was recognised in Knaggs [at 34-37] particular considerations that relate to legislative provisions concerning the manner in which the jurisdiction of courts is exercised or invoked. When a statutory provision relates to the exercising by a court of jurisdiction, particular principles of construction of legislation come into play. There is a “basic rule” that it is presumed that the Parliament does not intend to cut down the jurisdiction of courts save to the extent that the legislation in question expressly so states or necessarily implies: see Plaintiff S157/2002 v Commonwealth (2003) 211 CLR 476 at 505 [72], Berowra Holdings Pty Ltd v Gordon [2006] HCA 32 at [31].  
     
      
    29 No express provision is made in s 175(3)(e) or in the CP Act itself for the consequences of a failure to provide the required statement. There is no express statement that proceedings commenced by a CAN, which does not comply, will be invalid. Nor is there, in my view, a necessary implication of invalidity.  
     
      
    30 The nature of the obligation created by s 175(3)(e) is of particular significance. The CAN is obliged to bear what is in effect a warning to the accused person that failure to appear may result in the arrest of the person or in the matter being dealt with in the person’s absence. Section 175(3)(d) provides that the CAN must require the person to appear before the court at a specified date, time and place (unless a warrant for arrest is issued or bail is refused). It would be a peculiar result if the absence of the warning on either the Court/Service Copy or the Defendant Copy invalidates the proceedings before the court when the accused person appears on the date specified. Furthermore, as a matter of common sense, I do not believe it could ever have been intended that the omission in a Court/Service CAN of the warning results in invalidity as the provision of that information is relevant only to the accused person.  
     
      
    31 The possibility of variance between the form of the CAN to be filed and the CAN to be served is contemplated by the permission in s 175(2) to prescribe “one or more forms”. The Court/Service Copy is obviously intended to be the copy of the CAN which is to be filed in the registry of the court after the Statement of Service is completed. The box headed Court Registry use only makes provision for court staff to fill in information required for clerical purposes. Neither the Statement of Service nor the box for use by court registry staff appears on the Defendant Copy. Section 175 does not require that the CAN filed in the court registry must be identical in all respects with the CAN served on the accused person. 
     
      
    32 Summary criminal procedure was governed by the Justices Act 1902 until it was repealed with effect from 7 July 2003. The Courts Legislation Miscellaneous Amendments Bill introduced a legislative package to replace the Justices Act 1902. During the second reading speech of the Bill in the Legislative Assembly on 23 October 2002, Mr Moss, the Parliamentary Secretary, on behalf of the Attorney General said that sections 50 and 175 of the CP Act: 
     
      
       
        
        “…………make references to new terminology which may be ambiguous. It was not intended that the  
        Justices Act 
         reform package change the law in relation to the contents of the initiating process. Therefore sections 50 and 175 will be amended to more closely reflect the language of the current law.” (Hansard, Legislative Assembly, 23 October 2002 at 5750) 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
      Almost identical language was used by Mr MacDonald, the Parliamentary Secretary, in the second reading speech in the Legislative Council on 21 November 2002. 
       
      
    33 It was the legislature’s apparent intention that s 175 be construed in a way that does not alter the previous law concerning the contents of the initiating process for a summary offence: see Knaggs [at 66]. Under the Justices Act, summary criminal proceedings were generally commenced by a prosecutor laying an information before a justice of the peace. The justice could then issue a summons for the appearance of the defendant. If the defendant failed to appear, a warrant for the arrest of the defendant could be issued or the case could be heard in the absence of the defendant on proof of service of the summons: ss 52–77 of the Justices Act. Section 62 of the Justices Act made provision for the form of summons. 
     
      
    34 There was no requirement that a warning be provided to a defendant of the consequences of a failure to answer a summons. The omission of such a warning did not invalidate the proceedings commenced by an information. As the Legislature did not intend to change the law in relation to the contents of the initiating process as existed under the Justices Act, there is no reason to conclude that the Legislature intended that a non-compliance with s 175(3)(e) deprived a Local Court of jurisdiction. 
     
      
    35 The filing of a CAN which includes the statement required by s 175(3)(e) of the CP Act is not, in my view, an essential preliminary to the commencement of summary criminal proceedings. In the present proceedings the CANS which were filed have validly commenced proceedings against the plaintiff.  
     
      
    36 The second issue which arises for determination is the plaintiff’s contention that the prosecutor has failed to establish that the service of the CANS was effected in accordance with the CP Act and the Chief Industrial Magistrate erred when he found that Defendant Copy CANS which contained the warning required by s 175(3)(e) were served on the plaintiff.  
     
      
    37 The plaintiff complains that his Honour erred in drawing an inference in the prosecutor’s favour, when he commented on the plaintiff’s failure to give evidence. The inference said to have be drawn by his Honour is that the plaintiff’s evidence could not have assisted his case because he was served with Defendant Copy CANS. 
     
      
    38 The statements of service appearing on the Court/Service Copy CANS, the plaintiff argues, contain statements by the process server that he served “a copy of this Court Attendance Notice” (emphasis added) on the plaintiff and those statements are evidence that documents in the form of the filed CANS were in fact served. Clause 37 of the Local Courts (Criminal and Applications Procedure) Rule provides, the plaintiff points out, that a person who serves a document, must complete an endorsement as to service on a copy of the document served and there is every reason to construe clause 37 as a code for the service of CANS.  
     
      
    39 In support of the submission, reference was made to a passage which appears in the second reading speech made by the Attorney General on 5 December 2001 when introducing the Criminal Procedure Amendment (Justices and Local Courts) Bill, Crimes (Local Courts Appeal and Review) Bill and the Justices Legislation Repeal and Amendment Bill:  
     
      
       
        
        “…The new procedures will allow police to complete a court attendance notice or an application on the spot and hand it to the defendant, sign an endorsement of the same document, and send the notice to the court registry.” (Hansard, Legislative Assembly, 5 December 2001 at 19663) 
        
       
      
     The plaintiff places emphasis on the reference to the “same document”. 
     
      
    40 The prosecutor submits that the Chief Industrial Magistrate was entitled to form the view on the evidence that he did and no error in law or fact in his reasoning can be shown.  
     
      
    41 The argument for the plaintiff based as it is on a literal interpretation of the words “a copy of this Court Attendance Notice” makes little sense as the form of Defendant Copy CAN does not contain a statement of service. It is apparent that the Defendant Copy CAN is the form of CAN to be served and the Court/Service Copy is the form to be filed with a completed statement of service. The words “copy of this” CAN could only be intended to refer to the Defendant Copy CAN served on the accused person.  
     
      
    42 Clause 37(1) prior to being amended on 30 March 2007 was as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) A person who serves a document issued in proceedings must complete an endorsement as to service on a copy of the document served”. 
        
       
       
      As the  
      Court/Service 
       CAN includes the statement as to service and is the CAN to be filed, it is manifest that for the purpose of the rule a  
      Court/Service 
       CAN is a copy of the document served.  
       
      
    43 The reference to the “same document” in the second reading speech cannot sensibly be construed literally. After all, this would require the endorsement as to service being completed on the document previously served on a defendant. The endorsement is to be “of” the same document and not “on” the same document. In any event Clause 37 made clear what was required.  
     
      
    44 Evidence relevant to the issue of service of the CANS before the Chief Industrial Magistrate included the facsimile to the prosecutor from Ms Barnes, a solicitor with WorkCover, enclosing a letter dated 28 July 2005 providing instructions to the process server, the filed Court/Service Copy CANS with completed statements of service and the oral evidence of the prosecutor. An affidavit of Martin Connolly, the process server, has been filed in this Court. It was open to his Honour, upon the evidence then available to him, to conclude on the balance of probabilities that the plaintiff was served with Defendant Copy CANS. Whilst his Honour remarked upon the plaintiff’s failure to give evidence, he expressly recognised that there was no requirement for the plaintiff to do so. I am unable to find that the Chief Industrial Magistrate drew the inference contended by the plaintiff. 
     
      
    45 No error has been established which entitles the plaintiff to the declarations sought. The proceedings against the plaintiff were validly commenced within time. The Chief Industrial Magistrate has the jurisdiction to hear the proceedings. 
     
      
       
      Orders  
       
      
    46 I make the following orders:  
     
      
       
      1. That the Amended Summons be dismissed. 
       
      
     2. That the plaintiff is to pay the costs of the first defendant. 
     
      
       
      3. That the proceedings be remitted back to Chief Industrial Magistrate for hearing.

    SENTENCE1 HIS HONOUR: The B-grade cricket grand final had been held on Saturday 10 February 2007. Several of the players and friends celebrated into the early hours of the Sunday morning at the Post Office Hotel, Moree. Two of those present at the Post Office Hotel at 2am were Michael William Grant and Kodey Douglas McNamara. 2 Michael Grant born in August 1977 will be thirty years old this year. Kodey McNamara turns twenty-one in just a little over two weeks. 3 Each had been drinking continuously for something approaching twelve hours. Each was ill equipped to handle any difficult, complex or highly charged social incident. In the blink of an eye an incident occurred that was difficult, complex and highly charged. Both these men reacted inappropriately, violently and illegally. Their reaction was vigilantism of the worst kind. 4 As a result of their conduct over, according to the charge papers, a ten minute period each has been charged with:(1) aggravated break, enter and commit serious indictable offence, namely the assault of Jayden Byron occasioning to him actual bodily harm in circumstances of aggravation, namely being in the company of the other and a third young man. (2) malicious damage although the damage and property owners differ in each case. Michael Grant is charged with maliciously damaging a LandCruiser motor vehicle the property of Glenn Withers I have assumed the father carries the same name as the son. Kodey McNamara is charged with malicious damage to the front door of unit 6, unit 7 and unit 15, the property of the Sundowner Motel.(3) each has been charged with assaulting Glenn Withers whilst in the company of the other and a third young man.4 Today each is to be held accountable for his criminal conduct. As sentencing judge it falls to me to resolve a number of competing tensions as I strive to determine the appropriate sentence for these offences before this court committed by these offenders harming these victims in this community, see Gladue v The Queen [1999] 1 SCR 688 [80]. 5 My initial task requires an assessment of the objective criminality of the offences before the Court. I will also need to have regard to matters personal to each offender, the subjective matters. The starting point for such assessments requires a sentencing judge to make findings of fact from the evidence before the Court relating to the offence and to each of the offenders.6 My fact finding task has been circumscribed in this case in that the parties have tendered an agreed set of facts to which I shall shortly return. It is sufficient at this point if I remind the Court that a judge is not party to an agreed set of facts. The tender of the agreed facts does not relieve the judge from his fact finding responsibility but simply limits the material from which the facts may be found. To that extent, if it be the case, that the facts as agreed between the crown and each of the offenders does not reflect the actual events that occurred, it must be remembered the Court can only find facts from the evidence placed before it.7 Each offender's rehabilitation prospects will have to be assessed even if looking through a glass darkly. Before any sentence can be made there are likely to be technical questions relating to deterrence, discounts for pleas of guilty, whether special circumstances are to be found, whether any of these offences attracts a standard non parole period and if so whether the offence is one that requires a standard non parole period and finally of course the ultimate length of the term of imprisonment and other penalty that is to be imposed.8 None of these can be commenced until the primary facts are determined. What weight needs to be given to all of these matters against the imperative that all sentencing should have as its primary focus the protection of the community will also need to be determined see R v Cuthbert [1967] 2NSWR 329, R v Rushby [1977] NSWLR 597 and R v Hayes [1984] 1 NSWLR 740.Facts9 About 2am on Sunday 11 February 2007 Kodey McNamara, Michael Grant, a third offender and a group that I understand from the evidence to be somewhere about twenty to thirty had left the Post Office Hotel. The group was moving in a northerly direction on the footpath in Frome Street. I have tried in the days since receiving this evidence to envisage the spot in Frome Street opposite the court house really, where I anticipate this offence occurred. If it occurred near the pub then Jaydon Bryon must have gone over, not just the kerb, but the safety protrusion of the footpath into the street. 10 A white Toyota LandCruiser owned by Glenn Withers’ parents drove off from a parking spot directly outside the hotel. Glenn Withers was not driving, he was in the passenger seat. The vehicle was driven by one Jayden Byron a disqualified driver. It also headed in a northerly direction. It started with rapid acceleration of such force as to cause the rear tyres to skid and I have no doubt squeal on the roadway. 11 Police sitting in a marked police vehicle outside the Moree Police Station saw the incident. The vehicle drove and then swerved suddenly to its left mounting the footpath at the same time increasing its speed. It headed directly towards the crowd of youths who recently had departed the hotel. They were on the sidewalk directly in the path of the vehicle. The youths had to scatter for their lives or be struck by the vehicle. The vehicle drove some twenty metres along the footpath before returning to the road. It continued to accelerate along Frome Street reaching a speed police estimate of to be of about 100 kph. Police immediately set off in chase. 12 One of the members of the crowd responsed to the drama by calling out words to the effect “this is Renae Subeni all over”. Moree locals, and in particular Michael Grant and Kodey McNamara, knew the significance of that comment. Each had poignant recollection of the late Renae Subeni. She had been killed seven years before when another young man had wantonly aimed his vehicle at and driven into a crowd of young persons at a party somewhere in Moree.13 Michael Grant was there and had witnessed the incident. Significantly his brother and sister were also in that group and had to flee from the path of the oncoming vehicle. I accept the incident had, both at the time and subsequently, a profound effect upon him. I accept that the connection between the events being drawn to his attention inflamed and/or made more urgent a response from him to the situation. I accept it was one of a number of factors contributing to his response. Likewise it was a factor contributing to McNamara’s response. 14 McNamara, Grant, the third offender, and it would seem one or two others, got into a car headed in the same direction as the LandCruiser and police vehicle. 15 Others of the youths in the crowd would appear to have followed in other cars.16 The offenders received information, no doubt via the mobile phone, that Withers and Byron were staying at the Sundowner Motel. The three offenders were driven there at least there is no evidence which satisfies me either of the offenders before the Court drove the motor vehicle in which they were travelling.17 The LandCruiser was parked in front of unit 6 and 7. When McNamara and Grant arrived, Withers was checking to see if the white vehicle had been locked. He was approached by all three offenders. Each of McNamara and Grant punched him to the head causing him to fall to the ground. It was only after these blows had been struck that McNamara thought to ask him if he had been the driver of the white LandCruiser. Withers denied he had been. Grant grabbed a garden chair and a bottle smashing two of the cars windows and the windscreen. The car belonged to Mr Withers, the father. So far as I can tell he was an absolutely innocent victim. He had, of course, been nowhere near the scene.18 McNamara focussed on dealing with Jayden Byron. He kicked in the door of unit 6 at 2 in the morning. The occupant of the unit, a female, was woken with the door being kicked in. Terrified she screamed. To state the obvious she had nothing to do with the matters that were upsetting McNamara. McNamara, in no way dissuaded, then moved to unit 7, repeated the process, he kicked the door in. Again an unconnected innocent woman was woken from her sleep terrified and screaming.19 Withers, recognising the inevitable, that other doors were likely to be kicked in showed McNamara and Grant room 15. That door was also kicked in by McNamara. Jayden Byron was inside. He armed himself with a small pocket knife. I infer he did so only to defend himself. I infer he was fearful of what was about to happen. He was disarmed. Each of McNamara and Grant entered unlawfully those premises and punched him to the head, each in the company of the other and as I understand it a third person.20 Police arrived. The two offenders immediately and without any further trouble left the unit. Each of McNamara and Grant remained at the scene. Each participated in a sound recorded record of interview at the scene in which each made full admissions as to the part he played. 21 McNamara told police that he and others including his girlfriend had to jump out of the way to avoid the oncoming LandCruiser. Grant said the vehicle had only just missed him, his brother and sister - echoes of the past. 22 Each told police he had been drinking that night. It must have been obvious to police each of these men was well effected by alcohol. 23 McNamara conceded “I took matters into my own hands and I’m sorry”. Grant told police “if I was sober it wouldn’t have happened at all. I just would have been home”. 24 Both Withers and Byron suffered injury at the hands of their assaulters. Details of those injuries have not been disclosed to the Court. The malicious damage to the doors amounted to $1,023. The damage to the motor vehicle amounted to $597. I shall record that the following day each of the offenders put in process steps to repair and compensate for damage caused by their criminal conduct. On 15 February and 28 February earlier this year invoices totalling $1,023 were given to McNamara and Grant for damage to the motel. Each paid $512 towards those invoices. Grant paid for the repair to the motor vehicle windows and the windscreen. The action of each offender was done in the presence of, and perhaps seen by occupants of, or youths who came to the Sundowner Motel.Objective criminality25 From the facts as he finds them to be a sentencing judge is required to assess what is called the objective criminality of the offences as an essential step in assessing the seriousness of the criminal behaviour of each offender. That is done by comparing objectively the criminality exhibited in these cases with criminality of offences of a similar kind. It is in this way that the seriousness of the criminality of these offences can be evaluated. You would understand that the objective criminality has an important impact upon the overall sentencing outcome. 26 These are offences that have at their heart a vigilante motivation that undermines the rule of law. Retribution by at least these three, if not the mob, for a few minutes in the early hours of the morning of 11 February was seen to justify damage to three doors to the Sundowner Motel an innocent victim; the terrifying awakening from their sleep of two innocent third parties; and the damaging of a motor vehicle belonging to a father who had contributed nothing towards the outrageous conduct of an associate of his son. 27 The rule of law recognises a number of important propositions. Included among these are the right of persons to enjoy and use their personal property. In the case of the Sundowner Motel to produce income without fear of it being destroyed for no legal purpose. The right of persons such as Withers and Byron to the integrity of their body. Primarily the administration of criminal justice depends upon the proper investigation of crime by police and the fair trial of those accused and the sentencing of offenders by the Court. The offences with which I am dealing undermined the rule of law and in so doing caused fear and property damage to a number of otherwise disinterested citizens.28 The aggravated break, enter and commit the offence of assault occasion actual bodily harm in the company of others carries a standard non parole period of five years for offences that fall within what is called a mid range of seriousness. In assessing whether these offences would fall within that range I note that none of these offences was planned or indeed conceived until after the LandCruiser was driven at the group of youths. Even then the offences really were not conceived until the LandCruiser and Withers was seen at the Sundowner Motel.29 The two offenders had consumed copious quantities of alcohol for purposes related to the celebration of the end of the cricket season or some other social cause. To the point in time where they were driven at by Byron there is no suggestion either offender was acting obnoxiously. Their overstated aggressive behaviour comes as a direct result of Byron’s act. 30 The offence committed by Jayden Byron put several lives at risk including lives of those important to each offender and in the case of Grant to the lives of those who had already once been similarly threatened. The similarity of Byron’s conduct with the conduct of another driver causing death of a victim known to both offenders seven years previously was called to their minds by a comment made by a member of the crowd. That comment of course was not made with a view to inciting them but simply an observation of what that person felt.31 While Grant and McNamara appear to have accepted a leadership role, others in the crowd attacked by Byron were no doubt voicing anger, resentment and a desire for action. It may well be that those voicing anger, resentment and a desire for action, rather than being cool headed, allowed or contributed to or made easier for Grant and McNamara to do what they subsequently did.32 The smashing of the two doors and disturbance of the occupants of unit 6 and 7 constitutes an aggravating circumstance of the offence that carries the standard non parole period. However that aggravation is itself muted in that the smashing of the two earlier doors by McNamara was done in the mistaken belief that the LandCruiser was parked at the front of the unit containing Byron. I am satisfied McNamara genuinely believed that Byron would be in unit 6. When he was not there I am satisfied that McNamara genuinely believed he would be in unit 7. His reasoning was hopelessly wrong but his motives were not one of pure wanton destruction of the Sundowner Motels property.33 McNamara was young, aged 19 I think at the time. Grant of course was aged in his late twenties. 34 The offence of break and enter was the first offence of its kind by either. Grant had a prior actual bodily harm assault for which he was fined $900. I will come to that later.35 Each offender was entitled to a legitimate, and I stress the word legitimate, sense of outrage at the conduct of Byron in driving at him. Their subsequent illegal activity initially sprang from that legitimate sense of outrage.36 In all the circumstances therefore I would not find that the objective seriousness of this offence fell into that mid range of seriousness that attracts the standard non parole period. For the reasons I have just given while on its objective criminality I find it to fall below a mid range of seriousness. The offence is far from trivial or minimal. It must be somewhere between the mid range of offences on its objective seriousness and the lower end. On a spectrum I would place it just below mid range of seriousness as evaluated on its objective circumstances.37 I turn now to what I call the subjective circumstances. I am both entitled and required to do that. Not only am I sentencing for the criminal offences but I am also sentencing each of these offenders for them. Each offender coming before the Court will vary from other offenders who stand or who have stood for sentence. Circumstances personal to an offender may offer to the court some explanation and insight into the commission of this offence by these offenders or some reason why a more or less sentencing outcome is appropriate.38 I will review firstly the subjective circumstances of Michael Grant. Family dynamics/social relationships39 Michael Grant aged thirty works as a farm hand on Gurlie Station some fifty kilometres south of Moree. He has a partner, Sarah and a four month old son Charlie. He is the oldest of three siblings, a younger brother and sister previously mentioned. His family attended court to support him. He took the opportunity when giving evidence to undertake to them to do nothing like this again. I sense his family is close to and supportive of him. He acknowledged in court that among others his family had suffered stress as a result of his actions. Education/work history/skills40 Grant was educated to Year 12. He is employed by LRG Partnerships. Glenn Furnass supplied a reference recognising him as a highly valued and respected team member. He is engaged in areas of header driving, tractor driving, cattle work and farm maintenance. Furnass evaluates him as “extremely capable”. He is described as being able to take instruction and to use his own discernment. Grant is studying Agri business at university and has all but completed the degree. I think it is at the University of New England. The last unit is being done by correspondence. Grant has experience in pubs, presumably behind the bar. He has sporting skills particularly in Rugby. Of the five references tendered on his behalf three make reference to his leadership skills. It is to his credit that he has a capacity to lead. Such gifts also bring with them obligations, that is to lead responsibly. He presents as an impressive, decisive and determined young man. General health41 As best one can tell from appearances in court he is a strong, well built, athletic man in excellent health. Mental health42 There is no psychiatric report. There do not appear to be any mental health issues. He has had the benefit of a supportive and non deprived upbringing. He has a good work ethic.  Alcohol and drug issues43 I am satisfied on the evidence before me there is no illicit drug use. However it is clear there are alcohol issues; probably power drinking (seeking a level of lift in mood quickly) and binge drinking (episodic heavy drinking to a point of heavy inebriation). Features in grants abuse of alcohol44 The offender to his credit has sufficient insight to link his overstated aggression to his alcohol consumption. Almost immediately he approached the Anglican Counselling Service. He has had four counselling sessions with Wendy Long, a counsellor/educator. He says he has halved his alcohol consumption by drinking less frequently. That no doubt is of significant benefit to him, his family and social circle. It may well be that he still needs to address the features of drinking I referred to above, namely power and binge drinking. Character and antecedents 45 Michael Grant presents as an impressive young man. Since obtaining his Higher School Certificate he has worked and made significant contributions to the community through work and sport. During his uni study he made time to contribute to anti-youth suicide group “Links for Life” where he played a pivotal role in coordinating and raising in excess of $10,000 for that cause in 2001. He served as the club captain of the Robb College Rugby Club. 46 All who have supported him with references remark that the offence is out of character. One of his referees wrote “in all incidents Mr Grant has always been composed, showed leadership and made rational decisions handling all situations extremely well”. Regrettably it cannot be said in handling this incident with which the Court is dealing that Grant displayed any of the characteristics so admired by his referee. I do accept however that generally it was a past pattern. I say generally because there is an assault occasion actual bodily harm on his record. The fine for that assault is $900. To one experienced in the law such as me that is a heavy fine which indicates that the assault must have been of some seriousness or done in serious circumstances. There are also three charges relating to a driving incident in December 2001. Nonetheless the offender’s prior record is such that leniency can be extended. Attitude to the offence 47 There is little doubt that this offender is genuinely embarrassed by and disgusted with his behaviour. He has come to realise the enormity of his offending as the prison gates come into focus. He has come to understand what imprisonment would mean. As he said in his evidence “everyday I see my son doing something different and I don’t want to miss any of that”. There is an aspect of this case which has particularly impressed me. Both these young men have supported each other in seeking to retrieve and restore as much as could be retrieved and restored from their situation. Both set about recompensing for the property damage. Both sought to address together in counselling their drinking issues and I have little doubt that both sought to comfort and support each other as the court case approached and hopefully thereafter.Plea48 Both offenders pleaded guilty from the outset. There does not appear to me to have been any plea bargaining. Each appears to have accepted full responsibility for his actions. Each was forthright with the police on the morning of the incident. Each acknowledged the violence of his behaviour. In the case of each offender I do not intend to give a discount for the plea but I do intend to give a full benefit by changing the nature of the final sentencing outcome.49 I turn now to review Kodey McNamara’s subjective features.Family dynamics and social background50 He is a twenty year old man residing with his partner of three years. They live with his mother, her partner and two of his siblings. I know he is an uncle although to whom I am not entirely sure. There has been no contact with his father since birth. He told Probation and Parole that during his formative years there was no male role model for him. His family members were in court to support him. Notwithstanding the absence of a father it would appear he has otherwise been well supported and cared for during his childhood. One of his referees however made reference to his “attempting to protect and support his friends and family in some horrendous situations”. What those situations were and what, if any, impact they had upon him was not explained in evidence.Education/Skills/Vocational History51 The pre sentence report speaks of him achieving Year 12 Higher School Certificate status. It is noted that his longest period of unemployment since leaving high school has been two weeks. His work is casual and seasonal. There is a reference from Auscott. Lewis Loder, the day shift supervisor, informs the Court he is working at the Midkin Gin, that he is cooperative and eager to learn. He interacts well with team members. Another referee worked with him supervising him as a harvest casual. There McNamara showed capacity to work independently for extended hours, meet deadlines and display reliability. Currently he is working twelve hours daily, seven days per week. For the present he has put sport and drinking on hold. McNamara was a member of the B-grade side which had played in and lost the grand final earlier referred to. His evidence was he is comfortable with and enjoys his work choices. He earns $2,000 per fortnight.General Health52 Kodey McNamara is a tall, fit, solid built man who also appears to be in excellent health.Mental health53 There is no report of any mental health issue that would impede his future well being. He recognised immediately after his criminal conduct that he had anger management problems. I have already referred to his seeking counselling for it with Wendy Long. She observes “he worked very hard showing motivation and enthusiasm to manage his anger during these sessions”.Alcohol and drug issues54 There is no evidence to suggest any illegal drug use. There is however evidence of alcohol problems. On the day in question, for example, he had been drinking for twelve hours straight. There is insight into the link between his drinking and anger management. His response, in addition to counselling, has been to consume no alcohol since the offence.Character and antecedents55 This offender is still a young man. He has contributed to the community through his work. He has displayed a strong work ethic. He appears to be a family man valuing his partner and other family members. He has only one prior criminal offence, custody of an offensive weapon in a public place for which he received a six month s 9 bond. I am, in the light of that penalty, prepared to regard him as being otherwise a person of good character. Clearly the magistrate did not regard that offence as overly serious. His record entitles him to some leniency when dealing with the matters before the court. Circumstances motivating the offence56 The conduct of the driver on the evidence before me was criminal, dangerous and outrageous. No doubt this offender recognised all of those qualities in the driver’s conduct. Legitimate outrage would not have been a problem but it morphed instantly into a desire for retribution which he sought to satisfy. He had known Renae Subeni, I have already found that as a factor involved in his response. His consumption of alcohol though was a more significant factor. He was disinhibited, was impaired in his executive skills including judgment and cognition skills. 57 There is growing research showing adolescent and young men, aged eighteen to twenty-five, are not fully developed in those mental skills classed as executive skills. These are the skills relating to making judgment. Particularly in emotionally and tense situations the capacity of this group of society to make appropriate judgment calls is poorer than it ultimately will become. However there is no expert evidence on this before me. While I am aware of the existence of research the extent, if at all, to which it applies to this offender is not in evidence and therefore moot. Its significance is that executive skill development may have played some part. 58 I do however reject as an explanation one given to Probation and Parole by him that he was seeking to report Byron’s reckless use of the vehicle to police. It is highly likely on the evidence before me that he knew the police were already aware of the incident and were searching for the offender. It is to be recalled when I recited the agreed facts one of those facts was that the police vehicle left almost immediately chasing them. The explanation given to Probation and Parole is either an attempt by him to rationalise or perhaps to minimise his involvement. The danger of that is that it blocks the path to rehabilitation because he will have nothing to rehabilitate from in his mind.59 I should note in fairness that in evidence before me he was fully accepting of the extent of his conduct, its criminal nature and its impact upon the several victims. It is for that reason that I later come to a finding he has good prospects for rehabilitation. I am satisfied he is genuinely and realistically contrite. Rehabilitation prospects both offenders60 I am satisfied both offenders have strong rehabilitation prospects. Both have strong family and community support. Each appears to have supported the other towards rehabilitation and restitution since the incident. Both have accepted full responsibility for their offending conduct and are genuinely contrite. Both have minimal or minor involvement previously with the criminal law. Both have good physical and mental health. Both have a strong work ethic. Both appear to have reasonable self image. Michael Grant has sought in the past to make significant contributions to social issues of importance affecting others. Both have contributed to the community through sport participation. Australia rightly values its sportsmen and women as role models.Setting the sentence61 The circumstances of this offence, namely the vigilante aspect requires a component of general deterrence. I intend to achieve that end by imposing a term of imprisonment upon each for the major offence. As to personal deterrence I am persuaded that the likelihood of further offending is low. The arrest of, charging of, Local Court appearances, District Court appearances, denunciation of their conduct in open court by a judicial officer, the imposition of the penalties about to occur all constitute personal deterrence sufficient for these two men. Minimum non parole period62 I have already noted on its objective facts the aggravated break and enter, that is the major offence each faces, is below a mid range of seriousness recognised for these offences. Having now reviewed the subjective features of each I note that these subjective features would reduce further the level of seriousness for sentencing purposes. Further, I note a statutory non parole period would apply only after trial. 63 Of course the establishing by Parliament of a standard non parole period was an indication by the Parliament that it intended sentences imposed for these offences to be generally increased over past practices. In the first Court of Criminal Appeal judgment on standard non-parole periods the Court of Criminal Appeal, being a court to which this court is subject, after the introduction of the standard non parole, made this point, which it seems to me I can take advantage of [my memory of it is that the Chief Justice gave a judgment in which Wood J, the then Chief Judge at Common Law and Simpson J agreed, at para [114 Division 1A of Part 4 of the Sentencing (Criminal Procedure) Act”] you can take it from me that relates to the standard non parole period,  
     
      
      takes its place in the context of an Act which contemplates sentences other than those requiring a full term of imprisonment. In this regard it is noted that s5(1) gives an important direction in so far as it provides that a court must not sentence an offender to imprisonment unless it is satisfied, having considered all possible alternatives, that no penalty other than imprisonment is appropriate” 
      
     
     
      
      115, “This reflects the accepted principal that imprisonment is a sentence of last resort. A circumstance which the Act recognises in so far as provision is made for the suspension of sentence, periodic detention, home detention, monetary penalties and bonds to be of good behaviour. To that list could have been added parole periods.  
      
     
     
      
      116, the nature of offences included in the table is such that only rarely will sentences involving an alternative to full time custody be appropriate. However there is nothing in the Act to indicate any intention to confine the available sentence for a Table offence to one of full time custody provided that a non custodial sentence would be a proper sentence upon the particular facts of the case. In fact subject to appropriate reasons being given s 54(C)(1) of the Act expressly contemplates that alternatives to full time custody will continue to be available”.  
      
    64 What needs to be taken from that passage is that it will only be rarely that a full time custodial sentence will be avoided. Clearly if it is only rare that an offender will avoid full time custody in these cases then only exceptional cases will qualify. After some anguish I have come to a view that this is such an exceptional case for both young men: 
     
     the conduct of the driver was inflammatory placing as it did a number of young and innocent persons in serious peril 
     neither offender was drinking for other than a social purpose 
     each offender was personally threatened and persons important to each offender were likewise threatened 
     the episode had echoes of a prior tragic killing 
     the response of each was neither foreseen nor planned 
     the driver was fleeing the scene and police, his conduct thereby appearing not only outrageous but also cowardly 
     the damaged property was repaired forthwith and at the expense of each 
     the assault upon each victim was one limited to occasioning actual bodily harm 
     the rehabilitation of each offender commenced upon the following day or days and has been seriously undertaken by each 
     each has minimal or minor criminal record 
     each is impressive and performing otherwise as valued members of the community 
    Parity65 Both offenders criminality is in a sense embraced equally in all offences. I intend to treat each as equally culpable.Sentencing disposition66 Had the offences of assault occasion actual bodily harm and malicious damage come before the Court alone I would have been inclined to deal with them by way of heavy fines or a community service order. In the circumstances I intend to deal with them by way of fines. 67 Michael Grant will you stand up please? Michael William Grant you are convicted of this offence:- that between two and two ten in the morning on 11 February 2007 at Moree you assaulted Glenn Withers occasioning to him actual bodily harm while you were in the company of Kodey McNamara and one Brad Harmon. For that offence you are fined $1,000. Likewise you are convicted between the same time and at the same place you maliciously damaged property, to wit, the LandCruiser motor vehicle which was the property of Glenn Withers Senior, the dad. For that offence you are likewise convicted and fined $1,000. You are also convicted of the aggravated break and enter which is in these terms: that you on 11 February did break and enter the dwelling house of Jayden Byron because he was staying there, it is not his home of course, situated at the Sundowner Motel and in the said unit committed a serious indictable offence, namely assaulting him occasioning to him actual bodily harm in circumstances of aggravation, that being that you were in the company of another persons, namely Kodey McNamara and the said Brad Harmon. In respect of that offence I am sentencing you to twenty months imprisonment. I do intend that that sentence will be suspended upon your entering into a bond to be of good behaviour for twenty months from today. It will have these conditions: that you will accept supervision of Probation and Parole for six months and thereafter at the discretion of the Probation and Parole, that you will accept all reasonable directions of the Probation and Parole and in particular counselling, treatment and programs related to your alcohol consumption and your anger management. I should note that any failure to accept supervision which means not respond or not be there on time will result in a breach of the bond. It will be a condition of the bond that it will be deemed a breach of the bond so that you know. In the event of a breach of the bond I am to be notified within forty-eight hours and you will be called up in front of me. I need not tell you what is going to then happen. Sit down.68 Kodey McNamara will you stand up please? Mr McNamara I am convicting you of the offence that again between two and two ten in the morning on 11 February 2007 at Moree you assaulted Glenn Withers occasioning actual bodily harm to him while you were in the company of Michael Grant and the said Brad Harmon. For that offence you are to be fined $1,000. I am likewise convicting you that you at the same time and place you maliciously damaged property, the property of the Sundowner Motel. For that offence you are likewise fined $1,000. For the offence that you at the same time and place broke and entered the dwelling house Jayden Byron situate at the Sundowner Motel and then in the said unit committed a serious indictable offence, namely assaulting Jayden Byron while you were in the company of Michael Grant and Brad Harmon you are likewise sentenced to twenty months imprisonment. Again conditional upon your entering into a bond to be of good behaviour for twenty months from today, that is a year and eight months. I intend to suspend the sentence. The conditions are identical to those that I gave to Michael Grant and I do not think I need to read them out again, you heard them?OFFENDER MCNAMARA: Yes.HIS HONOUR: All right just sit down for a moment. Would you check with your clients please and see if they’re willing to enter into the bonds on conditions which I have indicated?MOYLAN: Yes your Honour, just excuse my back? Thank you your Honour they accept that.HIS HONOUR: Mr Crown one of the things I will do I haven't set a non parole period.MOYLAN: No your Honour.HIS HONOUR: I’m not entirely sure that I am compelled to. I would rather not set it.MOYLAN: No I don’t think there is a requirement now your Honour.HIS HONOUR: I think that I have an option to do it as I understand it but not a requirement.MOYLAN: Yes, correct.HIS HONOUR: For the benefit of each, should it come to pass that you do come before me, I will note that at this time I do not intend to set a non parole period. But should either come before me on a breach I would have found special circumstances if I were committing each of you to full time custody. That means that you would have had a longer than normal parole period, so it was to your benefit. Counsel can explain that. You will each be remanded because you are now strictly speaking in custody. You will each be remanded into the custody of your solicitor. Once the custodial matters have been dealt with by way of your entering into the bond you will be free to mix with your family and go.

    JUDGMENT1. There is a witness in the witness box giving evidence before the jury. His name is Musadek Al Zargani. The Crown Prosecutor has, I expect, almost finished with him in evidence-in-chief. The Crown Prosecutor has sought leave under s32 of the Evidence Act 1995 for the witness to use a document to try to revive his memory about a fact in the course of giving his evidence. That is not permitted by s32(1) of the Evidence Act without my leave. Various factors are stated in s32(2) which I will not set out. Mr Simpson opposes the application.2. The document from which the witness would be asked to refresh his memory is a statement dated 11 February 2005 given to the police. The events in respect of which he will be asked to give evidence occurred on 30 January 2005. 3. He has already given an account of what occurred on that day including his recollection of words said by one of the accused, Mr El Mostafa. There is a portion of his statement dated 11 February 2005 which the Crown Prosecutor has highlighted which contains the additional words in respect of which he wishes the witness to refresh his memory. Those words are: ""If you vote you will die"". 4. In opposing the application Mr Simpson says that there is no guarantee that the witness found the document to be accurate at the time. He points to the fact acknowledged by the Crown that there has already been, some days or weeks ago, an amendment to the statement concerning words recollected or not by this witness. In addition Mr Simpson argues that in accordance with s32(2)(b) the document was not made when the events recorded in it were fresh in his memory. 5. The authority on that question appears to be The Queen v Van Beelen 1972, a judgment of Sangster J in the Supreme Court of South Australia. It is reported as a note in 6 SASR 534. At 537 His Honour said:  
     
      
      “ 
      The suggestion in Cross on Evidence, Australian edition, of the requirement of 'Contemporaneity' seems to me, again with respect, to be wrong. Certainly if the memorandum were made or verified contemporaneously the facts would be fresh in the mind of the witness, but in my opinion the real test is freshness of memory as a question of fact and not the relationship in time, except that shortness of time makes it easier to accept the witness's assertion that the facts were fresh and length of time more difficult - and a great length of time would undoubtedly lead any court to reject the evidence claiming that the events were fresh in the memory of the witness at the time of making the memorandum 
      "". 
       
      
    6. The time in this case is almost two weeks and what the witness is being asked to recollect are specific words uttered by one of the accused. He has given his account in court without that addition of these specific words.7. Two matters to which my attention has been drawn by both parties and are contained in s192 of the Evidence Act. Mr Simpson argues in accordance with s192(2)(b) that it would not be fair to his client and the Crown Prosecutor acknowledges fairly that the importance of the evidence to be called by reference to clause (c) is not overwhelmingly significant.8. I find it difficult in accordance with the Van Beelen terminology to accept, given the length of time, the assertion that the specific contents of the statement were fresh in the memory or would have been fresh in the memory of this witness almost two weeks after the event.9. Although not referred to in submissions it has become clear in the course of my presiding over this matter that the altercation which is the subject of this evidence was followed by a riot that evening or at least a sequence of events the Crown alleges was a riot and would have received a significant degree of publicity.10. I take that into account in determining the extent to which, in those circumstances, the few additional words might have been fresh in the memory of this witness. Accordingly I refuse leave to this witness to refresh his memory from the document.

     OLIVER MARKISIC v COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA & ANOR 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 CAMPBELL JA:  
     
      
       
      Nature of the Appeal 
       
      
    2 This is an appeal from an order of Simpson J given on 8 November 2005, that dismissed a Notice of Motion by which the appellant, Mr Oliver Markisic, made a charge of contempt of court against Mr Michael (Mick) Keelty, the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police (“AFP”). 
     
      
    3 That Notice of Motion was brought in proceedings in which Oliver Markisic and his mother Marika Markisic were the plaintiffs. That action, number 20369/01 in the Common Law Division, names the Commonwealth of Australia as defendant. It alleges various torts that the Appellant describes in an affidavit as ""trespass to the land, assault, battery, false imprisonment and false arrest, nervous shock, interference with domestic relations and so on."" I will refer to that action as ""the Trespass Proceedings"". It arises from an incident that the Appellant alleges occurred on 29 September 1998, where, according to him, members of the AFP entered the plaintiffs’ house and land without a warrant authorising them to do so, and abducted from there a child, Elena Markisic. The appellant says that Elena was born on 3 May 1997, and therefore she would have been nearly 17 months old at the time. It appears that Elena was the child of the appellant's brother, Dragan Markisic, and that there had been dispute between Dragan Markisic and the child's mother, Katerina Markisic, that related in some way, not altogether clear from the material before us, to the custody of the child. 
     
      
       
      The Notice of Motion 
       
      
    4 The Notice of Motion in question was filed on 14 June 2005. The substantive order it sought was: 
     
      
       
        
        ""An order that Mick Keelty, Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police, to shaw [sic] cause why not be held in contempt of the Supreme Court of New South Wales."" 
        
       
      
    5 It had annexed to it a Statement of Charge, in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “Mick Keelty, Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police challenged the authority of the Court and committed contempt of court by not providing all the documents as required under the Subpoena for production of documents issued by the Supreme Court of NSW on 06 April 2004 and addressed to the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police.” 
        
       
       
      The Evidence in Support of the Notice of Motion 
       
      
    6 On 6 April 2004 the Appellant caused to be issued a subpoena, in the Trespass Proceedings, directed to ""the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police"". The subpoena was in the conventional form, and stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “THE COURT ORDERS that you shall ATTEND AND PRODUCE this subpoena and the documents and things Described in the schedule (in this subpoena called the “scheduled documents”) 
        
       
       
        
        a) before the Supreme Court; 
        
       
       
        
        b) at the Supreme Court, Law Courts Building, Queen’s Square, Sydney, New South Wales; 
        
       
       
        
        c) on 28/4/04 at 9.00am; 
        
       
       
        
        and until you are excused by the Court from further attending” 
        
       
      
    7 The schedule to the subpoena read: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is requested from the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police to produce: 
        
       
       
        
        1. The Warrant to take possession of the child Elena Markisic born 03.05.1997, which is a document the five members of the AFP should have used as a lawful justification for entering the house of Oliver and Marika Markisic (the plaintiffs) on 29.09.1998 and taking of the above child from the said house 
        
       
       
        
        2) All records, documents, emails, communications and notes in the possession of the Australian Federal Police in relation to the supposed above Warrant 
        
       
       
        
        3) All records, documents, e-mails, communications and notes in the possession of the Australian Federal Police which refer to or relate to the following persons 
        ; in 1998/99 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          a) Dragan Markisic, whose date of birth is 02.08.1959 
           
          b) Elena Markisic, whose date of birth is 03.05.1997 
           
          c) Katerina Markisic, whose date of birth is 04.04.1970 
           
          d) Oliver Markisic, whose date of birth is 16.09.1955 
           
          e) Marika Markisic, whose date of birth is 01.03.1935” 
          
         
        
       
       
      The expression  
      “; in 1998/99” 
      , which I have indicated in bold, appears in handwriting on the copy of the subpoena that is in evidence. It is not clear when or in what circumstances it was placed there. 
       
      
    8 The Australian Government Solicitor (“AGS”) accepted service of the subpoena on behalf of the Commissioner.  
     
      
    9 On the return date of the subpoena, 28 April 2004, the Commissioner did not produce any documents. It was stood over to 14 May 2004, on which date the Commissioner produced some documents that had been requested by the subpoena.  
     
      
    10 The Appellant formed the view that production was not complete. He spoke to two different solicitors at the AGS, each of whom told him that the Commissioner had produced all the documents in the possession of the AFP.  
     
      
    11 On 16 June 2004 the Appellant filed a Notice of Motion in which he requested orders including: 
     
      
       
        
        “1. The Defendant to produce the documents requested under paragraphs a), c) and d) in the Notice to produce documents served on Mrs. Roshana Wikramanayake, a solicitor employed by the Australian Government Solicitor. 
        
       
       
        
        2. The Commissioner of the AFP to produce all the documents requested in the Subpoena for production issued by the Supreme Court on 06.04.2004.” 
        
       
      
    12 In support of that application, the Appellant swore an affidavit on 15 June 2004, but that affidavit provided no cogent evidence of incomplete production having been made, merely an assertion that production was incomplete. 
     
      
    13 On 11 October 2004 the Appellant wrote to the Commissioner, again requesting production of the documents. That led to an officer of the AFP producing to the Court Registry some additional documents. The covering letter, dated 14 October 2004, said that those documents were: 
     
      
       
        
        “… located as a result of a thorough search of AFP and Interpol records. 
        
       
       
        
        The AFP has now produced all documentation in response to this subpoena.” 
        
       
      
    14 On 18 October 2004 the same AFP officer also wrote to the Appellant, notifying him of the production of the extra documents, and also stating: 
     
      
       
        
        “The AFP has now produced all documentation in response to this subpoena.” 
        
       
      
    15 The Appellant remained dissatisfied with this response.  
     
      
    16 On 3 December 2004 the Appellant filed another Notice of Motion seeking an order that: 
     
      
       
        
        “1. The Commissioner of the AFP to produce all the documents requested in the Subpoena for production issued by the Supreme Court on 06.04.2004.” 
        
       
      
    17 In support of that application, the Appellant swore an affidavit that annexed three documents that he had in his possession and that the Commissioner had not previously produced in answer to the subpoena. One of them was a facsimile from a solicitor at the Department of Community Services to one Allison Barrett. It is not clear whether or not Ms Barrett has any role in the AFP. The letter relates to assistance that Ms Barrett might provide on 14 October 1998 in assisting Katerina Markisic and Elena Markisic to fly from Sydney to Frankfurt. There are two other documents, each of which appears on its face to be a case report of the AFP, connected with the arrival of Katerina Markisic in Australia on 12 October 1998.  
     
      
    18 At a hearing before Smart AJ on 3 February 2005, the AGS produced some additional documents. 
     
      
    19 On 29 April 2005 the Appellant wrote again to the Commissioner, informing him that the matter would again be before the Court on 6 May 2005.  
     
      
    20 On 6 May 2005 before the Court, a representative of the AFP tendered a letter dated 5 May 2005 stating in part: 
     
      
       
        
        “I have reviewed the Markisic file and can confirm that all documents have been produced by the Australian Federal Police in response to the Subpoena for Production served by Mr Oliver Markisic and issued on 6 April 2004. These documents have been produced directly to the Supreme Court of NSW on two occasions being 28 April 2004 and 15 October 2004. 
        
       
       
        
        In December 2004, further searches were conducted to locate any material that may not have been produced. These searches identified several legal files and a previously unidentified file in relation to Elena Markisic. These documents were reviewed and further documentation was produced in answer to the subpoena. It is our understanding that this material was produced to the court by the Australian Government Solicitor before His Honour Acting Justice Smart on 3 February 2005. At that time legal professional privilege claims were made in relation to certain documentation by AGS on behalf of the Australian Federal Police. Further, it was agreed between the parties that certain documents would be edited on the grounds of privacy. 
        
       
       
        
        The Australian Federal Police confirm that there is nothing further to produce in answer to the Markisic subpoena.” 
        
       
      
    21 The Appellant remained dissatisfied with that response. The Registrar directed the Appellant to serve on the Commissioner a list of the documents he believed the Commissioner should have produced, and directed the Commissioner to respond to that list.  
     
      
    22 In compliance with that direction, the Appellant sent to the Commissioner a list. The first two paragraphs of the list are introductory. Paragraphs 3-7 of that list identified by description various classes of documents that the appellant alleged existed. Paragraph 8 identified four documents with some, though incomplete, particularity. Paragraph 9 identified three documents quite specifically.  
     
      
    23 The AGS wrote back on 25 May 2005 asserting that paragraphs 3-7 inclusive of the list did not comply with the Registrar’s order, and seeking further information concerning the other documents that were requested. It appears that the Appellant did not provide that further information. Instead, he filed the Notice of Motion alleging contempt on 14 June 2005. 
     
      
    24 In support of his Notice of Motion for contempt, the Appellant swore an affidavit on 14 June 2005 that annexed copies of several other documents that fell within the description of documents called for by the subpoena. They were copies of letters that Dragan Markisic had written, addressed to the AFP, and enclosures in those letters. It appears to be the contention of the Appellant (though it is not established by evidence before us) that the AFP did not produce copies of those documents in response to the subpoena. All those documents bear dates in the range September 1998 to November 1999.  
     
      
       
      Competency of the Appeal 
       
      
    25 The Respondent submitted that the appeal was incompetent by reason of section 101 Supreme Court Act 1970. So far as relevant that section states: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) Subject to this and any other Act and subject to the rules, an appeal shall lie to the Court of Appeal from:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) any judgment or order of the Court in a Division, and 
          
         
        … 
        
       
       
        
        (5) An appeal lies to the Court of Appeal from any judgment or order of the Court in a Division in any proceedings that relate to contempt (whether civil or criminal) of the Court or of any other court. 
        
       
       
        
        (6) Subsection (5) does not confer on any person a right to appeal from a judgment or order of the Court in a Division in any proceedings that relate to criminal contempt, being a judgment or order by which the person charged with contempt is found not to have committed contempt.” 
        
       
       
      The Respondent submits that the present appeal relates to a criminal contempt, that the Commissioner has been found not to have committed contempt, and hence that no appeal lies to the Court of Appeal. 
       
       
      Was the Notice of Motion a Charge of Contempt At All? 
       
      
    26 One basis upon which the Appellant submits that the proceedings were not for criminal contempt is that the order sought in the Notice of Motion amounted to an order that the Commissioner explain the circumstances of non-production of the documents. The Appellant points out that the Notice of Motion does not ask that the Commissioner be punished. As I understand it, the substance of the Appellant’s contention in this respect is that the Notice of Motion should be seen as seeking an order for the Commissioner to file an affidavit, or go into the witness box, to explain why the documents had not been produced, and hence (incidentally) why it was that he had not committed contempt of court. In that way, as I understand the submission, the Notice of Motion is in the nature of an interlocutory proceeding seeking orders aimed at the further production of documents, not at punishment for a contempt already committed. 
     
      
    27 While the Notice of Motion was poorly framed, it used language that was common in systems of procedure that preceded the one now applicable. For example, the precedent for an order nisi for prohibition contained in Addison and Paterson, The Law and Practice Relating to Appeals from Magistrates (Law Book Company 1927) p 294 is an order directed to the defendant, ordering him to “show cause” at a particular place and time “why a writ of Prohibition should not be issued” prohibiting certain specified actions. While these days a court would not after a hearing actually make an order in the terms set out in the Notice of Motion, the Notice of Motion could still readily be read as inviting the Commissioner to put such evidence or argument as he wished before the Court, for the purpose of the Court deciding whether he was guilty of contempt. As well, the annexure of a Statement of Charge to it was strongly indicative that it was intended to be the vehicle by which a charge of contempt of court was made. Further, the language of the Statement of Charge said in so many words that the Commissioner had committed contempt of court. Further, the words in the Statement of Charge alleging that the Commissioner “challenged the authority of the Court” are also indicative of an allegation of contempt of court being made. 
     
      
    28 The course of the hearing also bears out that it was a charge of contempt of court that was being made. The oral submissions of the Appellant to the trial judge included the following: 
     
      
       
        
        “In this respect I would submit that the statement of charge discloses why possibly Mr Keelty allegedly committed contempt of court by not providing all the document as required under the subpoena. 
        
       
       
        
        And the fact is for me at least that the Commissioner has not produced all the document and that in itself would represent a contempt of Court regardless of the motives of the Commissioner. 
        
       
       
        
        … I have for more than one year endeavoured to find a way the Commissioner to release all the documents required under the subpoena. Theoretically I could have filed this statement of charge and the rest of the documents maybe after the return of the first return of the subpoena when no documents, for example, were provided. I did not do that deliberately and under the paragraph 7 your Honour could see there were 4 returnable times, but they were all in 2004, the last one, and since then I have tried on many occasions to remind the Commissioner of his obligations under the subpoena to produce documents. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        In my mind the Commissioner simply ignored to release documents. … I am saying probably the first contempt occurred was when the Commissioner failed to disclose all the documents.” 
        
       
      
    29 The trial judge permitted the Appellant’s brother, Mr Dragan Markisic, to address the Court notwithstanding that the Appellant had already made submissions. Mr Dragan Markisic said: 
     
      
       
        
        “At this stage my brother is at the position that the statement of charge as is drawn and filed in the register of Supreme Court discloses on its face case against Mr Keelty, but if your Honour is in any case of opinion that statement of charge is not sufficiently drawn, something is missing like allegation of deliberate suppression of documents, that would require my brother just to amend the statement of charge to include every necessary element, including allegation of deliberate suppression of document by Mr Keelty. And also maybe to include specifically when the contempt occurred, the period from 6 July, 6 April 2004 up to certain period as is specified in affidavit of my brother.” 
        
       
      
    30 At no time in the submission made to her Honour was any suggestion put that her Honour should make an order requiring the Commissioner to file an affidavit or give oral evidence explaining the circumstances that led to a “no further documents to produce” response being made on two occasions, after which further documents were in fact produced.  
     
      
    31 The trial judge’s judgment makes clear that she regarded the question she was asked to decide as being one of whether the Commissioner had committed contempt.  
     
      
    32 The impression that a charge of contempt was brought, and tried, is also confirmed by the terms of documents that the Appellant filed for this appeal. The orders sought by the Notice of Appeal included: 
     
      
       
        
        “2. To punish the Commissioner of the AFP for civil or criminal contempt of the Supreme Court of NSW or for both. 
        
       
       
        
        3. In alternative the case be remitted to the Common Law Division of the Supreme Court of NSW for re-hearing of the Notice of motion for contempt.” 
        
       
      
    33 Part of the Appellant’s written submissions included the words: 
     
      
       
        
        “The judgment of her Honour dismissing the First Plaintiff’s notice of motion is effectively saving the Commissioner from punishment he deserved when he intentionally did not produce documents …” 
        
       
      
    34 In my view it is clear that what was occurring before her Honour was the trial of a charge of contempt of court.  
     
      
       
      Was the Charge One of Criminal Contempt? 
       
      
    35 Throughout the period April 2004 to June 2005, Part 37 Rule 12(1) Supreme Court Rules provided: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Failure to comply with a subpoena without lawful excuse is a contempt of court and the addressee may be dealt with accordingly."" 
        
       
      
    36 However, the rule cast no light on whether the contempt involved was a civil or a criminal contempt. 
     
      
    37 In Australasian Meat Industry Employees’ Union & Ors v Mudginberri Station Pty Ltd (1986) 161 CLR 98, the joint judgment of Gibbs CJ, Mason, Wilson and Deane JJ gave consideration to the distinction between civil and criminal contempts. Their Honours said, at 106: 
     
      
       
        
        “Punishment for contempt serves two functions: (a) enforcement of the process and orders of the court, disobedience to which has been described as “civil contempt”; and (b) punishment of other acts which impede the administration of justice, such as obstructing proceedings in court while it is sitting or publishing comments on a pending case, which have both been described as “criminal contempt”.” 
        
       
      
    38 Their Honours observed, at 107: 
     
      
       
        
        “The theoretical distinction between the two classes overlooks the underlying rationale of every exercise of the contempt power, namely that it is necessary to uphold and protect the effective administration of justice. Although the primary purpose in committing a defendant who disobeys an injunction is to enforce the injunction for the benefit of the plaintiff, another purpose is to protect the effective administration of justice by demonstrating that the court's orders will be enforced. As the authors of  
        Borrie and Lowe's Law of Contempt 
        , 
          
        2nd ed. (1983) say, at p.3:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          “If a court lacked the means to enforce its orders, if its orders could be disobeyed with impunity, not only would individual litigants suffer, the whole administration of justice would be brought into disrepute.”” 
          
         
        
       
      
    39 Also at 107, their Honours say, 
     
      
       
        
        “The unsatisfactory nature of the distinction is attested by the arbitrary classification of some instances of disobedience to an order as examples of criminal contempts.” 
        
       
       
      and go on to give examples of such  
      “arbitrary classification” 
      . They say, at 108: 
       
       
        
        “The concept that disobedience to an order becomes criminal when the primary purpose of exercising the power changes from vindication of the rights of the plaintiff to vindication of the authority of the court is both complex and artificial. Salmon LJ was right when he said in  
        Jennison v Baker 
        , 
         at p 64, speaking with reference to the enforcement of an injunction generally, that “the two objects are, in my view, inextricably intermixed”.” 
        
       
      
    40 Their Honours conclude, at 109: 
     
      
       
        
        “There is, accordingly, much to be said for the view that all contempts should be punished as if they are quasi-criminal in character, notwithstanding the adoption of the contrary view by some members of this court in the decisions to which we have already referred.” 
        
       
      
    41 In Witham v Holloway (1995) 183 CLR 525, the High Court, in the course of deciding that all charges of contempt must be proved beyond reasonable doubt, gave further consideration to the difference between civil and criminal contempts. The joint judgment of Brennan, Deane, Toohey and Gaudron JJ has, as I read it, a structure whereby their Honours consider various justifications that have been given for the distinction between civil and criminal contempts, and end up satisfied with none of them. They say, at 530: 
     
      
       
        
        “In general terms, the distinction between civil and criminal contempt is that a civil contempt involves disobedience to a court order or breach of an undertaking in civil proceedings, whereas a criminal contempt is committed either when there is a contempt in the face of the court or there is an interference with the course of justice. However, disobedience or breach of an undertaking amounts to a criminal contempt if it involves deliberate defiance or, as it is sometimes said, if it is contumacious.” 
        
       
      
    42 After recognising the long-standing distinction between civil and criminal contempt, their Honours advance for discussion, at 531, a thesis that: 
     
      
       
        
        “The basis of the distinction between civil and criminal contempt is said to lie in the difference between proceedings which are remedial or coercive in the interest of the private individual and proceedings in the public interest to vindicate judicial authority or maintain the integrity of the judicial process.” 
        
       
      
    43 However the “public interest/private interest” dichotomy that is part of that thesis is rejected at 532-533: 
     
      
       
        
        “One problem is that there is not a true dichotomy between proceedings in the public interest and proceedings in the interest of the individual. Even when proceedings are taken by the individual to secure the benefit of an order or undertaking that has not been complied with, there is also a public interest aspect in the sense that the proceedings also vindicate the court's authority. Moreover, the public interest in the administration of justice requires compliance with all orders and undertakings, whether or not compliance also serves individual or private interests.  
        
       
       
        
        Nor can the dichotomy between proceedings in the public interest and proceedings in the interest of the individual be maintained on the basis that some cases involve an interference with the administration of justice and others merely involve an interference with individual rights. All orders, whether they be Mareva injunctions, injunctions relating to the subject matter of the suit, or, simply, procedural orders, are made in the interests of justice. Non-compliance necessarily constitutes an interference with the administration of justice even if the position can be remedied as between the parties.” 
        
       
      
    44 Their Honours then go on, at 533, to reject the part of the thesis that the nature of the contempt depends on whether the purpose of the proceedings is punitive, as opposed to remedial or coercive: 
     
      
       
        
        “Moreover, there is considerable difficulty with the notion that, in some cases, the purpose or object of the proceedings is punitive and, in others, the purpose or object is remedial or coercive.” 
        
       
      
    45 Their Honours give reasons for taking that view, and conclude at 534: 
     
      
       
        
        “The differences upon which the distinction between civil and criminal contempt is based are, in significant respects, illusory. They certainly do not justify the allocation of different standards of proof for civil and criminal contempt. Rather, the illusory nature of those differences and the fact that the usual outcome of successful proceedings is punishment, no matter whether primarily for the vindication of judicial authority or primarily for the purpose of coercing obedience in the interest of the individual, make it clear as Deane J said in  
        Hinch, 
         that all proceedings for contempt “must realistically be seen as criminal in nature” ( 
        Hinch  
        (1987) 164 CLR 15 at 49). The consequence is that all charges of contempt must be proved beyond reasonable doubt.” 
        
       
      
    46 McHugh J gave a separate judgment. He summarised, at 538-539, the traditional distinction between criminal and civil contempts: 
     
      
       
        
        “Criminal contempts are acts or omissions that have a tendency to interfere with or undermine the authority, performance or dignity of the courts of justice or those who participate in their proceedings. Although criminal contempts take many forms, their characteristic attribute is an interference with the due administration of justice either in a particular case or as part of a continuing process. Defiance of the court or its procedures, publication of matters scandalising the court, actions calculated to prejudice the fair trial of a pending case, threats to parties or witnesses and misconduct within the court are examples of criminal contempts. Civil contempts, on the other hand, are concerned with failures to comply with judgments or orders of the courts. But civil and criminal contempt overlap. Thus, disobedience to the order of a court constitutes criminal contempt when the disobedience is contumacious. Defiance of the court's order renders criminal what would be otherwise civil contempt. Where non-compliance with a judgment or order goes beyond mere breach and involves misconduct, civil contempt also has “a penal or disciplinary jurisdiction [that is] exercised by the court in the public interest”. (footnotes omitted) 
        
       
      
    47 McHugh J, like the joint judgment, goes on to consider various rationales for the distinction between civil and criminal, and is satisfied with none of them. He concludes, at 549: 
     
      
       
        
        “The case for abolishing the distinction between civil and criminal contempts is a strong one. Moreover, it is a course of action that is open to this court having regard to its duty to rationalise the principles of the common law. But, having regard to the argument that we heard, there is no need to consider whether we should take that step in this case. It is sufficient to say that, in applying the standard of proof laid down in  
        Peek 
        , 
         the Supreme Court erred. The appeal must therefore be allowed.” 
        
       
      
    48 Since then, the only occasion of which I am aware when the distinction between criminal contempt and civil contempt has been mentioned in the High Court is in X & Ors v Australian Prudential Regulation Authority & Anor [2007] HCA 4; (2007) 232 ALR 421 at [51], 432-433 where Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Callinan, Heydon and Crennan JJ said only that it was “inappropriate here to consider any further” that distinction. 
     
      
    49 While both Mudginberri and Witham are judgments in which majorities in the High Court have expressed dissatisfaction with the justification for the distinction between civil and criminal contempts, that is not the same as them deciding that all the contempts that would traditionally be classified as civil are, in reality, criminal contempts. Quite the contrary – both in Mudginberri and in Witham the joint judgments, in the passages I have quoted at paras [37] and [41] above, have stated what the distinction is between the two types of contempt.  
     
      
    50 Section 101(5) and (6) were introduced into the Supreme Court Act 1970 by the Courts Legislation Amendment Act 1996. In those sub-sections the legislature utilised the distinction between civil and criminal contempt as the basis for a rule about when an appeal could lie from an acquittal on a charge of contempt. It appears to be contemplated by those sub-sections that there can be an appeal against an acquittal, on a charge of contempt, where the charge in question is a charge of a civil contempt. Section 101(5) and (6) were introduced well after the decisions in Mudginberri and Witham were delivered. Those legislative provisions need to be applied in a way that recognises the distinction between civil and criminal contempts, even though there is good reason to believe that distinction is an unsatisfactory one. 
     
      
    51 The Courts Legislation Amendment Act 1996 also introduced into the Supreme Court Act 1970 a new section 101A. That section empowers the Attorney-General, at any time after the conclusion of contempt proceedings in which an alleged contemnor is found not to have committed contempt, to submit to the Court of Appeal a question of law arising from, or in connection with, those proceedings. Section 101A(11) provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “This section applies to criminal contempt only, and does not apply to civil contempt. 
        
       
       
      Usually, if one expression is used more than once in a statute, it is construed as having the same meaning each time it is used, unless there are differences of context or purpose between the different places at which it is used in the statute. 
       
      
    52 The validity of section 101A was considered by the Court of Appeal in John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd v Attorney-General (NSW) (2000) 181 ALR 694. Spigelman CJ said, at [5]-[6], 697: 
     
      
       
        
        “5. The illusory nature of the distinction between civil and criminal contempt has led the High Court to determine that all charges of contempt must be proved beyond reasonable doubt: see  
        Witham v Holloway 
         (1995) 183 CLR 525 ; 131 ALR 401. See also  
        Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd v Dagi  
        [1996] 2 VR 117 at 194-5 per Hayne JA. Nevertheless, parliament expressly states in subs (11) that s 101A applies only to contempt proceedings for what would, traditionally, have been regarded as a criminal contempt, namely proceedings which are not remedial or coercive in the interests of a private individual. 
         
         
        6. For that reason, no doubt, the parliament chose to assimilate a Crown appeal from an unsuccessful proceeding for contempt, with the limited circumstances in which a Crown can take proceedings by way of appeal on an acquittal in a criminal trial. The common law doctrine that the Crown cannot appeal from a verdict of acquittal is well established.” 
        
       
      
    53 That passage was neither agreed with, nor disagreed with, by the other members of the Court (Priestley and Meagher JJA), but is persuasive authority concerning how “criminal contempt” should be understood in section 101(5) and (6) Supreme Court Act 1970. 
     
      
    54 Since the decision in Witham, the ongoing existence of the distinction between civil and criminal contempts has also been recognised in another context, by the Court of Appeal in Bhagat v Global Custodians Ltd [2002] NSWCA 160 where Spigelman CJ (with whom Ipp and Brownie AJJA agreed) said, at [32]: 
     
      
       
        
        “Although there is a distinction between civil contempt and criminal contempt, the distinction has often been difficult to draw.” 
        
       
      
    55 In Markisic (Oliver) v The Commonwealth [2006] NSWCA 150 the present Appellant had sought leave to appeal against the striking out of a contempt motion that the present Appellant had brought, in the Trespass Proceedings, against people other than the Commissioner. The Court (Ipp and Basten AJJA) refused leave to appeal on the basis that an appeal would, by virtue of section 101(6) Supreme Court Act 1970, be incompetent. Part of the reasoning which led their Honours to that conclusion was (at [7]): 
     
      
       
        
        “It is now well-established, and was not disputed in these proceedings, that a charge of contempt by misleading or otherwise misbehaving in the course of proceedings, is essentially criminal in nature: see, eg,  
        Witham v Holloway  
        (1995) 183 CLR 525 at 534.” 
        
       
      
    56 That decision is not decisive of whether a right of appeal exists in the present case for two reasons. First, the contempt alleged in that case, namely the making of statements by counsel and by a solicitor that were alleged to be false, related to a different type of contempt to that alleged in the present case. An allegation of conduct aimed at misleading the Court is an allegation of a criminal contempt, as traditionally understood. Second, in any event it appears that there was no argument about whether section 101(6) precluded any right of appeal. A decision is not authority for a matter that has been assumed, rather than actually decided, in the course of making the decision: Baker v the Queen [1975] AC 774 at 788; Archer v Howell (1992) 7 WAR 33 at 46; Savouts v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2000] FCA 1059 at [32]-[33]; R (Kadhim) v Brent London Borough Council Housing Benefit Review Board [2001] QB 955 at [20]-[25], [33]-[39], 962-963, 965-966. 
     
      
    57 I incline to the view that the present proceedings are a criminal charge of contempt, because they are not remedial or coercive in the interests of a private individual. They seem to relate to alleged past breaches, and the punishment that is sought to be imposed seems to be simply for the purpose of punishing those breaches, rather than as a means of inducing the Commissioner to comply with the terms of the subpoena in a way that he had not previously done. 
     
      
    58 However, the Appellant is a litigant in person, and, while he has experience in litigation and presented his case clearly, he was not able to provide the Court with much assistance on the meaning of “criminal contempt” in section 101(5) and (6) Supreme Court Act 1970. While the Respondent took the point that the appeal was not competent, the argument that the Respondent presented on the topic was comparatively brief. As the topic is an important one, I would prefer not to rest the decision of the appeal on my present view about whether what is involved in the present case is an allegation of criminal contempt, when (as will hereafter appear) another basis upon which the appeal can be dealt with is available. 
     
      
    59 In these circumstances, rather than decide the case on the basis of the competency of the appeal, I will proceed by assuming, without deciding, that the appeal is competent. 
     
      
       
      Was the Standard of Proof Met? 
       
      
    60 It is unquestionable, since Witham, that whether the charge is classified as alleging a criminal contempt or a civil contempt, before it is found proved each element in the charge must be proved beyond reasonable doubt.  
     
      
    61 The Appellant submits that it is quite clear that there has been non-compliance with the subpoena, because the Commissioner has not produced the documents referred to in it. However, mere non-production of documents that are called for by a subpoena, or other court order to produce documents, is insufficient to establish that there has been a contempt. As well, it needs to be established that, at the date on which the documents were required to be produced, the alleged contemnor had documents that met the description of the documents called for by the subpoena or other order to produce: In Re Bramblevale Ltd [1970] 1 Ch 128 at 137-138; Thorpe v Marr’s Furniture Removals Pty Ltd [2000] QSC 279 at [11]; Wyszynski v Bill [2005] NSWSC 110 at [59]-[61]. 
     
      
    62 Further, there is a mental element involved in contempt of court. Mudginberri concerned a contempt arising from disobedience to a court order. While the focus of the decision in that case was whether a court had power to impose a fine in consequence of a breach of a court order, reaching a conclusion on that topic involved giving consideration to what was involved in contempt of court consisting of breach of a court order.  
     
      
    63 In a lengthy paragraph at 111-112, Gibbs CJ, Mason, Wilson and Deane JJ, as I read it, approved the distinction made by the English Court of Appeal in Fairclough v Manchester Ship Canal Co [1897] WN 7; 41 SJ 225 between “casual, or accidental and unintentional disobedience” and “what was required in a case where ‘it were sought to commit a private individual to prison for contempt’ or ‘to sequestrate the property’ ‘of a company’ upon the ground of disobedience”. Their Honours held that conduct that is deliberate, and in fact breaches a court order, and is not a casual or accidental or unintentional breach, counts as wilful conduct. Their Honours conclude, at 113: 
     
      
       
        
        “… a deliberate commission or omission which is in breach of an injunctive order or an undertaking will constitute such wilful disobedience unless it be casual, accidental or unintentional.” 
        
       
      
    64 As I read their Honours, their view is that the imposition of punishment is justified for a breach of a court order only if there is wilful disobedience, in the sense of deliberate action or inaction that is not casual, accidental, or unintentional. That conclusion applies regardless of whether the contempt involved in the disobedience to the order is classified as a civil or a criminal contempt. Thus, proof that a contempt has been committed by breaching a court order involves proving enough to conclude that the action or inaction said to constitute the breach was deliberate, and not casual, accidental or unintentional. Consistently with Witham, that needs to be proved beyond reasonable doubt. 
     
      
    65 The trial judge’s conclusion concerning discharge of the criminal onus was, at [52]: 
     
      
       
        
        “Taking a simplistic view of the evidence produced by Mr Markisic, it would be possible to suspect that proper attention was not paid to what was required in order to comply properly with the subpoena; but it is also possible to perceive that the quantity of material (and its age – the schedule refers to an event of September 1998) might have made identification of the relevant material more difficult. Suspicion about the degree of commitment to the task of responding to the subpoena, either by the Commissioner or those acting on his behalf, is not sufficient to discharge the criminal onus.” 
        
       
      
    66 The Appellant submitted that there must have been various types of documents in existence that the Commissioner had not produced. He submitted that there must have been orders in writing, or written records of oral orders instructing the police officers in question to enter his house. He submitted that there must be reports to their superiors from the officers who entered the house about their activities. Otherwise, he submitted, the officers in question would have been acting in a totally unauthorised way while supposedly on duty, in which case there should be records of disciplinary action against them. He submits that it should be inferred that there were reports about the seizure of the child, up through the chain of command to the Commissioner. He submitted that we should take judicial notice of the fact that members of the AFP always take notes of what they do on duty.  
     
      
    67 I do not accept those submissions. In my view the matters of either possible or likely organisational practice that he points to might, at best, provide grounds for a plausible suspicion that more documents than were actually produced had (at least once) existed, but they do not provide proof beyond reasonable doubt that such documents existed. Nor is there a basis for inferring, at a level of satisfaction beyond reasonable doubt, that, even if any such documents had once existed, they were still in existence at the various times that the subpoena was called upon. 
     
      
    68 In these circumstances, I see no error in the trial judge’s conclusion quoted above at para [65].  
     
      
       
      Bias 
       
      
    69 Another basis upon which the Appellant sought to set aside the decision was bias on the part of the trial judge. The bias alleged was actual bias, not apparent bias. The grounds of appeal put the allegation in the following way: 
     
      
       
        
        “a) At the hearing her Honour demonstrated an intention to save the Commissioner of the Federal Police from contempt of court by not adjourning the hearing to allow the First Plaintiff to consider the case law presented by surprise at the hearing by the opponent 
        
       
       
        
        b) Her Honour’s general intention was to save the Commissioner of the Federal Police from contempt of court 
        
       
       
        
        c) Her Honour is biased towards the Commonwealth of Australia as a party in the proceedings 
        
       
       
        
        d) Her Honour demonstrated at the trial held on 28, 29 and 30.11.2005 and 01.12.2005 in the Supreme Court’s proceedings No. 20492/99, where the appellant was assisting his brother Dragan Markisic (the Plaintiff), that her Honour is biased and in particular: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          i) oppressive – open maliciously against Markisics while acting with hatred against Markisics 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ii) biased and taking side of any opposite party of Markisics with an aim to damage as much as possible Markisics’ case in the Supreme Court 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          iii) acting for the benefit of the State of NSW and the Commonwealth of Australia” 
          
         
        
       
      
    70 The matter referred to in allegation (d), relating as it did to events that occurred after the decision from which this appeal is brought, would need to be based upon evidentiary material that was tendered on the appeal, and that the Court decided to admit in exercise of its powers under section 75A(7)-(9) Supreme Court Act 1970. No such evidence was tendered, and consequently no ruling was made admitting it. Thus, there is no basis upon which allegation (d) could succeed. 
     
      
    71 It may be that failure to tender the transcript of the hearing referred to in allegation (d) was an oversight on the part of the Appellant. I have examined that transcript, and can find in it no support for allegation (d). 
     
      
    72 The only evidentiary foundation for allegations (a)-(c) is the transcript of the hearing that led to the judgment against which the Appellant now appeals. 
     
      
    73 One matter that is relied upon as indicating bias on the part of her Honour arises from the fact that at the very start of the hearing the Appellant applied for a “further adjournment of 14 days” on the basis that he had been provided, just a few minutes previously, with a list of authorities upon which the Respondent intended to rely. One of the cases on that list was unreported. Counsel for the Respondent offered to provide a copy of it to the Appellant. The Judge refused the adjournment. 
     
      
    74 In my view, refusal of the adjournment, even when looked at in conjunction with the rest of the transcript, and the decision at which the trial judge arrived, provides no basis whatever for concluding that the trial judge was biased. 
     
      
    75 Another matter stated in the Appellant’s submissions (though, in fairness to the Appellant, I should say that it is not altogether clear that it is relied upon in connection with the allegation of bias) is that the trial judge: 
     
      
       
        
        “… did not even reprimand the Commissioner as being the chief policeman in this country, supposed to uphold the law, allowed himself to be even cast on with a shadow of inappropriateness when dealing with a court order addressed to him.” 
        
       
      
    76 It is no part of the task of a judge, deciding a question of liability on a charge of contempt of court, to reprimand the person alleged to have committed contempt for doing the acts that are alleged to constitute the contempt. Indeed, at that stage of the proceedings, before the question of liability had been decided, it would be totally inappropriate for the judge to do so. If a charge of contempt is made out, and the matter then proceeds to the stage of sentence, it can sometimes be appropriate for a judge to indicate, sometimes strongly, disapproval of the conduct that has been found to constitute the contempt. However, this matter never reached the stage of sentence.  
     
      
    77 In these circumstances, the trial judge’s failure to reprimand the Commissioner in the course of the hearing below or in her reasons for judgment is no indication of bias on the part of the judge. 
     
      
    78 Another submission upon which the Appellant relies is that the result of the application shows that the Commissioner has succeeded in avoiding production of the documents and that the trial judge “in effect attempted to save the Commonwealth of Australia from suffering judgment and huge damages.”  
     
      
    79 The fatal difficulty with this argument is that there is no basis whatever for concluding that one of the objectives the trial judge was attempting to reach was to save the Commonwealth from suffering judgment and paying damages. She had no conceivable motive to do so. 
     
      
    80 Indeed, the trial judge was in no position to conclude that the Commissioner had escaped, for all time, production of any documents he might still have that fall within the scope of the subpoena. That is because the trial judge did not have placed before her the totality of the interlocutory applications that there have been seeking production of the documents. It may be that additional interlocutory applications could be made, of a type not involving an application to punish the Commissioner for contempt, aimed at flushing out any remaining documents. In saying that, I do not suggest that either (a) I am satisfied, on the evidence now before us, that there are additional documents – that matter has simply not been adequately investigated on the evidence before us, or (b) there would actually be, when all the interlocutory applications that there have been aimed at production of the documents are examined, some procedural stone that the Appellant has left unturned. My conclusion is solely that, on the evidence before the trial judge, she could not have concluded that the Commissioner had for all time escaped production of any documents that he might have, that fall within the subpoena. Nor did she purport to so conclude. 
     
      
    81 A more general submission is also made by the Appellant, that the trial judge,  
     
      
       
        
        “is biased for the reason that her Honour does not like and cannot accept an idea that the Markisics’ family are victims and holds in prejudice to the Plaintiffs in the lower court proceedings that the suffering of the Markisics’ family from the government is well deserved.” 
        
       
      
    82 There is no finding by her Honour, either in express words, or in substance, “that the suffering of the Markisics’ family from the government is well deserved.” 
     
      
    83 There is no shred of evidence to support the balance of the contention that I have just quoted. 
     
      
    84 In all these circumstances, the allegation of bias is not only wrong, it is totally unsustainable.  
     
      
    85 The orders I propose are: 
     
      
       
      1. Appeal dismissed. 
       
       
      2. Appellant to pay costs of Respondents.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I have had the benefit of reading the judgment of Rothman J in draft. I agree that leave to appeal should be granted and the appeal determined as his Honour proposes.  
     
      
    2 The critical factor in the resolution of the appeal is that the applicant committed further offences after been released on a good behaviour bond. By his conduct the applicant confirmed his propensity for committing drug related offences and a steadfast disobedience of the law. In these circumstances an offender can expect a sentence at the higher end of the appropriate range in order to meet the objectives of “retribution, deterrence and protection of society” (Veen v R (No 2) (1998) 164 CLR 465). 
     
      
    3 As Rothman J has demonstrated although the sentences which her Honour imposed were at the higher end, they were not beyond the range so as to be excessive. 
     
      
    4 HIDDEN J: I agree with Rothman J. 
     
      
    5 ROTHMAN J: Lap Tap Young, the applicant, seeks leave to appeal the sentence imposed by Her Honour Judge Morgan DCJ on 28 July 2006.  
     
      
    6 The applicant was charged with supply prohibited drugs, methylamphetamine, not less than an indictable quantity (date of offence being between 9 June 2005 and 16 August 2005) contrary to section 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW). The maximum penalty for that offence is imprisonment for 15 years or 2,000 penalty units fine or both. The applicant pleaded guilty to that offence. The applicant also included on a Form 1 the offence of possess prohibited drug, methylamphetamine (date of offence 25 August 2005) contrary to section 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW). The applicant was also before her Honour in relation to the revocation of a breach of good behaviour bond that had previously been imposed by her Honour on 2 March 2006.  
     
      
    7 In relation to these matters her Honour imposed the following sentences: 
     
      
       
      (a) for the revocation for breach of good behaviour bond, her Honour imposed a sentence of 18 months’ imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 9 months, to commence on 6 July 2006 and expire on 5 April 2007 with a balance of term of 9 months to expire on 5 January 2008; 
       
       
      (b) for the supply of prohibited drug (including the possess prohibited drug on the Form 1), her Honour imposed a sentence of 3 years’ imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 18 months to commence on 5 January 2007 and expire on 4 July 2008 with a balance of term of 18 months to expire on 4 January 2010.  
       
      
    8 The appellant in the notice of appeal raised three grounds of appeal: 
     
      
       
      (a) her Honour erred in that the applicant was not indicted; 
       
       
      (b) the sentence for the offence was manifestly excessive; 
       
       
      (c) the sentence did not properly reflect pre-sentence custody.  
       
      
    9 At the hearing before this Court, the first ground listed above was abandoned. Given the nature of the ground, this was a commendable and appropriate course.  
     
      
    10 I deal with the ground of appeal relating to manifest excess in the sentence imposed. It is necessary to outline briefly the circumstances of the offence and the nature of the reasoning of her Honour in sentencing the applicant.  
     
      
    11 The applicant pleaded guilty and the facts were agreed. It is accepted that since March 2005 the applicant had been the subject of a covert investigation in relation to the supply of prohibited drugs. Electronic surveillance was used and a number of mobile telephone calls were intercepted. The evidence established that between 9 June 2005 and 16 August 2005 the applicant was supplying crystal methylamphetamine in amounts of 1 gram or less at a time to a number of prostitutes in the Sydney city area whom the applicant knew.  
     
      
    12 During that period a number of acts of supply were identified (being 18 in number) being supply of amounts varying between 0.25 grams and 3 grams and totalling an amount of 12.75 grams (although on four occasions the amount of drugs involved is unclear and they have not been included in any total). While these amounts were not included in the agreed facts, they were derived by the applicant from an analysis of the intercepted telephone calls that were otherwise before the Court.  
     
      
    13 However the intercepted telephone calls that were before the Court were only a representative sample of the dealing in drugs conducted by the applicant.  
     
      
    14 It is necessary to give some history beyond that which has been provided above. On 7 June 2004 the applicant was found in possession of 25 tablets of ecstasy and was charged in relation to that offence. The applicant pleaded guilty and was sentenced by Morgan DCJ for the offence of deem supply of not less than an indictable quantity of ecstasy. Her Honour imposed a sentence of 18 months’ imprisonment with a non-parole period of 9 months. That sentence was wholly suspended on entering into a section 12 bond to be of good behaviour on condition that the applicant place himself under the supervision of the Probation and Parole Service.  
     
      
    15 The offences that the applicant seeks to appeal were committed while he was on bail pending the earlier sentence (on 28 July 2005) and while he was subject to the section 12 bond. Indeed, the applicant was committing the offences now subject to application for leave to appeal on the very day in which he was sentenced by Morgan DCJ and on which date his sentence was wholly suspended.  
     
      
    16 In her remarks on sentence, Morgan DCJ sets out the background of the applicant and recites his use of drugs at an early age as well as certain problems that existed for him during his childhood. Her Honour also recites the criminal history of the applicant which dates from his youth but which is otherwise not particularly serious.  
     
      
    17 Her Honour gave the applicant the benefit of what she described as the supply of very small quantities of drugs and the fact that they were supplied, largely, to sex workers in payment for services rendered. Her Honour also gave the applicant the benefit of what she considered was genuine remorse. Her Honour referred to the purposes of sentencing set out in section 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) which codify and adumbrate principles that have long been recognised as the purpose of sentencing. In sentencing an offender, a sentencing judge must balance the need to protect the community, to deter criminal activity (both by the offender and generally within the community), rehabilitation of the offender and community retribution of the criminal offence in question. As has been stated on a number of occasions, it is not an exercise in pure logic. It is an exercise in discretion and an appeal against such an exercise can be successful only when one of the well known grounds for disturbing such an exercise is established. The purposes of sentencing overlap and cannot be considered in isolation from each other. They often conflict and point to different conclusions: see Veen v R [No 2] (1988) 164 CLR 465.  
     
      
    18 In dealing with the manner in which the antecedent criminal history of an offender should be dealt with in the sentencing process, the High Court in Veen v R [No 2] (1988) 164 CLR 465 said: 
     
      
       
        
        “… the antecedent criminal history of an offender is a factor which may be taken into account in determining the sentence to be imposed, but it cannot be given such weight as to lead to the imposition of a penalty which is disproportionate to the gravity of the instant offence. To do so would be to impose a fresh penalty for past offences ….  
        The antecedent criminal history is relevant, however, to show whether the instant offence is an uncharacteristic aberration or whether the offender has manifested in his commission of the instant offence a continuing attitude of disobedience of the law. In the latter case, retribution, deterrence and protection of society may all indicate that a more severe penalty is warranted. It is legitimate to take account of the antecedent criminal history when it illuminates the moral culpability of the offender in the instant case, or shows his dangerous propensity or shows a need to impose condign punishment to deter the offender and other offenders from committing further offences of a like kind.” 
        
       
      
    19 With this applicant, his apprehension and the imposition of a sentence upon him on the first occasion in March 2006, had no effect on his conduct. There can be few more obvious examples of the need for condign punishment in order to effect retribution, deterrence and the protection of society. Not only were the offences for which the applicant was here sentenced not an uncharacteristic aberration in behaviour, but they displayed a continuing attitude of disobedience of the law. That attitude will no doubt continue unless and until an appropriate change occurs. Such a change in attitude will not be effected without an appropriate sentence for the offences in question. This Court has often stated that the commission of offences whilst on conditional liberty is a very serious issue that affects the objective seriousness of the case: R v Ponfield (1999) 48 NSWLR 327 at [48]. It is also an aggravating circumstance under section 21A(2)(j) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW).  
     
      
    20 Ultimately the issue agitated by the applicant is whether the sentences imposed are appropriate. The applicant relied upon a schedule of decided cases in the Court of Criminal Appeal dating from 1993 and sought, by reference to it, to show that the general trend in sentencing had been much lower than the sentence imposed upon the applicant. That schedule shows that the severity of sentences increased significantly from about 2000, presumably to reflect community attitudes to the prevalence of drug offences. Only twenty-seven cases were included in the schedule.  
     
      
    21 The applicant also relied upon statistics prepared by the Judicial Commission of New South Wales showing the range of consecutive and non-consecutive terms for this offence on a plea of guilty where there was only one count subject of sentence and Form 1 matters were included. Those statistics concerned in the one instance 20 cases and in the other 18.  
     
      
    22 One must be exceedingly carefully in applying statistics arithmetically. If applied arithmetically, a statistical analysis will simply perpetuate results that become self fulfilling. Sentencing is not an arithmetic exercise: Markarian v R (2005) 79 ALJR 1048. In R v Clarke, unreported, NSWCCA 15 March 1990, this Court expressed a view, reflecting the then and current community view on the importance of general deterrence of drug traffickers. It is only in exceptional circumstances that a non-custodial sentence will be appropriate for a person who is trafficking. A person, such as the current applicant, who supplies drugs on more than one occasion (see R v Bardo, NSWCCA, unreported, 14 July 1992; R v Gip [2006] NSWCCA 115) will ordinarily face a full time custodial sentence.  
     
      
    23 While an end supplier will generally not receive the severity of sentence of persons higher in the supply chain, where a court is faced with a person who quite flagrantly ignores previous and extant sentences, it is appropriate that condign punishment be imposed. This means that the relative leniency, compared to more senior suppliers in the chain, that is usually reflected in the sentencing of small suppliers such as the current applicant, may be of less importance than the need to deter the displayed propensity of the particular offender and to seek to ensure that society may be protected from what would otherwise be a continuing and flagrant disobedience of the law.  
     
      
    24 The applicant was sentenced to 36 months with a non-parole period of 18 months. This puts the sentence at the very upper end of the mid range of sentences on the statistics provided. As earlier stated statistics may be misleading.  
     
      
    25 While the sentence is at the high mid range, it is not beyond the range and is not manifestly excessive.  
     
      
    26 One aspect of the sentence imposed caused some concern, being that raised in the third ground of appeal. It seems that, through a miscalculation, her Honour has failed to take account of fifty-one days of pre-sentence custody served by the applicant. During the course of the submissions on sentence this matter was discussed. It concluded with the following exchange: 
     
      
       
        
        “HER HONOUR: In considering that, the only matter I would really have to consider is taking into account the time that he spent in custody in relation to this matter, the sentence matter, and how that may be able to be dealt with by way of commencing at an earlier date in that non-parole period, to take account of that month and twenty days, whatever it was. Would that be an appropriate way in which to give him that benefit? 
        
       
       
        
        OWENS [THE CROWN]: Yes. I think that would be appropriate. If you backdate the commencement of the sentence for one month and twenty days, or fifty days, that would adequately address that issue.” 
        
       
      
    27 On appeal, the Crown, once more, conceded the appropriateness of that backdating. That error in calculation should be the only variation of the sentence.  
     
      
    28 In the circumstances I propose that the Court make the following orders: 
     
      
       
      (a) leave to appeal granted and the appeal granted in part; 
       
       
      (b) the sentence (other than on the revocation for breach of the good behaviour bond) imposed on the applicant by Morgan DCJ on 28 July 2006 (including the offence on the Form 1) be quashed and in lieu thereof the following sentence be imposed; 
       
       
        
        (i) for the offence of supply prohibited drug, methylamphetamine, not less than indictable quantity (date of offence between 9 June 2005 and 16 August 2005) contrary to section 25(1) of the  
        Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985  
        (NSW) [including the offence of the Form 1 of possess prohibited drug, methylamphetamine (date of offence 25 August 2005) contrary to section 10(1) of the  
        Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985  
        (NSW)] the applicant be sentenced to 3 years’ imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 18 months to commence on 16 November 2006 and expire on 15 May 2008 with a balance of term of 18 months to expire on 15 November 2009.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 HODGSON JA: On 19 September 2005, the appellants were arraigned before Studdert J on a charge that they between 5 January and 19 January 2001 at Greenwell Point in the State of New South Wales did feloniously slay Joy Golbie Achin. Both appellants pleaded not guilty and were tried before Studdert J and a jury. On 2 November 2005, both appellants were found guilty of manslaughter.  
     
      
    2 On 15 December 2005, Studdert J sentenced both appellants for two offences, one being an offence of breaking and entering a dwelling house and committing therein a serious indictable offence in circumstances of aggravation (which I will call aggravated break and enter) of which they had previously been found guilty, and the other being the offence of manslaughter. In each case, for the aggravated break and enter the trial judge imposed a sentence of imprisonment for 10 years from 26 March 2001, and declined to set a non-parole period; and for manslaughter, the trial judge imposed a sentence of imprisonment for 18 years from 26 March 2002, and set a non-parole period of 13 years 6 months to commence on 26 March 2002. He specified 25 September 2015 as the first date on which each was to become eligible to be released on parole.  
     
      
    3 The appellants appeal from their conviction for manslaughter, and seek leave to appeal from their sentence.  
     
      
       
      CIRCUMSTANCES 
      
    4 The Crown case was that the appellants, together with Shannon Styman (Ian Styman’s nephew), broke into the deceased’s house in Spies Avenue, Greenwell Point in the early hours of 7 January 2001, bound and gagged her, took cash from the house and then left her. At 4.52am that morning, Ian Styman made a 000 emergency call from a public telephone booth, requesting that a police car be sent to Spies Avenue, Greenwell Point because “there was a couple of blokes that went in with guns”. The call was not responded to, and as a consequence the deceased was not rescued and she died, probably between 16 and 18 January 2001. Her body was discovered on 19 January 2001.  
     
      
    5 In September 2002, the appellants and Shannon Styman were indicted on charges of murder of the deceased, aggravated break and enter and other charges. Shannon Styman pleaded guilty to aggravated break and enter, and otherwise the appellants and Shannon Styman pleaded not guilty to all charges. After a trial before Barr J and a jury, on 11 December 2002 the appellants were found guilty of murder and aggravated break and enter, Shannon Styman was found guilty of manslaughter, and there was a not guilty verdict on the other charges.  
     
      
    6 Barr J sentenced Shannon Styman to 8 years’ imprisonment for aggravated break and enter, and 14 years’ imprisonment for manslaughter. He did not appeal.  
     
      
    7 Barr J sentenced each of the present appellants to life imprisonment for murder. Each of them did appeal, and the Court of Criminal Appeal upheld their appeals in relation to the conviction for murder, and that conviction was quashed. The conviction for aggravated break and enter was upheld, but the sentences imposed for it were set aside. The Court of Criminal Appeal also ordered that there be a new trial of the appellants on the charge of manslaughter. 
     
      
    8 It was pursuant to that order that the appellants were tried before Studdert J. 
     
      
       
      GROUNDS OF APPEAL 
      
    9 The appellant Taber relies on the following grounds: 
     
      
       
        
        1. That the Trial Judge erred in law by holding that the Appellants/Applicants did not have available to them a plea in bar in the respect of the offence pleaded in the indictment; alternatively any further proceedings upon the indictment should not be permanently stayed by reason of an abuse of process;  
         
        2. That in all circumstances the verdict of the Jury on the count of manslaughter should be set aside because it was unreasonable;  
         
        3. That there has been a miscarriage of justice by reason of the Trial Judge ruling, over objection, that evidence of the prosecution witness Shannon Styman, given in a previous trial, be read to the Jury as evidence in the prosecution case;  
         
        4. That in all circumstances the sentence imposed upon the Applicant is manifestly excessive;  
         
        5. That the Sentencing Judge failed to have sufficient regard to the fact that the Applicants were party to and encouraged the 000 rescue call, the sole purpose being to effect the rescue of the deceased;  
         
        6. That the Sentencing Judge erred by declining to find special circumstances. 
         
        7. That the Sentencing Judge erred by failing to order that the sentences be wholly concurrent. 
        
       
      
    10 The appellant Styman relies on the following grounds: 
     
      
       
        
        1. The learned trial judge erred in law in holding that the appellant was not entitled to rely upon a plea in bar to the indictment for manslaughter in circumstances where the act, as an element of the offence, relied upon to establish manslaughter being the act of deprivation of liberty was the same act or an act included in, as an element of the offence, the earlier conviction of the appellant for break and enter and commit a serious indictable offence;  
         
        2. The learned trial judge erred in law by failing to hold that the indictment for manslaughter was a more aggravated form of offence for which the appellant had already been dealt with in the earlier conviction of break and enter into the dwelling house of Mrs Alchin and commit there a serious offence, namely that while in the company of Peter Taber and Shannon Styman he robbed Mrs Alchin of her money and at the same time deprived her of her liberty and in the circumstances barred in merger by autrefois convict;  
         
        3. The learned trial judge erred in law in holding that section 65 (3) had application to previous representations by the co- accused Shannon Styman and/or to previous representations by the co-accused Shannon Styman which co-accused which constitute admissions without the consent of the appellant under section 80 (3);  
         
        4. The learned trial judge erred in law in determining whether the probative value of the evidence of the previous representation of Shannon Styman were outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice within section 137 by:  
         
        (i) taking into account an irrelevant consideration being the conviction for break and enter;  
         
        (ii) taking into account an irrelevant consideration being the strength of the circumstantial case of the Crown;  
         
        (iii) failing to take into account as unfair prejudice being the advantage of the Crown not having to comply with section 37(1) and having cross examined Shannon Styman involving leading questions within the meaning of the Evidence Act;  
         
        (iv) failing to take into account the unfair prejudice as to the risk of improper use of the leading questions framed by the Crown of Shannon Styman;  
         
        (v) failing to take into account as unfair prejudice as to the risk of comparative disadvantage in assessment of credibility of the appellant as against Shannon Styman;  
         
        (vi) failing to take into account as unfair prejudice the importance of cross examination of an accuser in the context of circumstances where the Crown opened to the jury that oral evidence would be adduced, where the Crown did not disclose to the jury in opening the likelihood of unavailability, being a fact known to the Crown, and where both co-accused had disclosed the intention to give evidence;  
         
        (vii) failing to take into account as unfair prejudice the absence of cross examination as to the explanation for the unavailability;  
         
        (viii) failing to take into account as unfair prejudice the risk of improper implication of the unavailability being due to the conduct and guilt of the accused;  
         
        (ix) failing to take into account as unfair prejudice the absence of consent of the appellant as to previous representations constituting admissions under section 80 (3) in the earlier proceedings;  
         
        (x) failing to take into account as unfair prejudice the risk of the dulling effect of lengthy transcript reference reading improperly diminishing the efficacy of the cross examination on behalf of the appellant in the earlier proceedings as to the unreliability and want of credibility of Shannon Styman;  
         
        (xi) failing to take into account as unfair prejudice the risk of jury's opportunity of observing Shannon Styman and his apparent contempt of court being improperly used as behaviour having an adverse affect on the jury's assessment of the accused.  
         
        5. The learned trial judge should have held under section 138 that the unfair prejudice to the appellant outweighed the probative value of the previous representations of Shannon Styman so as to exclude such evidence; 
         
        6. That in all the circumstances the verdict of the jury on the count of manslaughter was unreasonable and should be set aside;  
         
        7. That in all the circumstances the sentences imposed upon the applicant for manslaughter and for break and enter were excessive;  
         
        8. That the learned sentencing judge erred by failing to take into account as a special mitigating circumstance the appellant's call to triple 0, embellishment to ensure action, belief that the call would be acted upon to rescue the deceased and unexplained failure of the supervisor to activate the computerised incident dispatch system;  
         
        9. That the learned sentencing judge erred in fixing the non-parol period by failing to take into account the triple 0 call as special circumstances warranting a parol period less than two thirds of the head sentence;  
         
        10. That the learned sentencing judge erred in law given the overlapping nature of the two convictions by failing to order that the sentences be served concurrently;  
         
        11. That the learned sentencing judge erred in law by failing to expressly avoid punishing the appellant twice for the deprivation of liberty of the deceased.  
        
       
      
    11 I will deal in turn with the following issues: 
     
      
      1. The question of plea in bar and abuse of process (Taber’s appeal ground 1 and Styman’s appeal grounds 1 and 2). 
       
      2. The question of admission of hearsay evidence of Shannon Styman (Taber’s appeal ground 3 and Styman’s appeal grounds 3-5). 
       
      3. The question whether verdict was unreasonable (Taber’s appeal ground 2 and Styman’s appeal ground 6). 
       
      4. The challenge to the sentences (Taber’s appeal grounds 4-7 and Styman’s appeal grounds 7-11). 
       
       
      PLEA IN BAR AND ABUSE OF PROCESS 
      
    12 The charge of which both appellants were found guilty on 11 December 2002 was a charge under s.112(2) of the Crimes Act 1900. Section 112 is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        112 Breaking etc into any house etc and committing serious indictable offence 
         
        (1) Whosoever:  
         
          
          breaks and enters any dwelling-house, or any building within the curtilage of any dwelling-house and occupied therewith but not being part thereof, or any school-house, shop, warehouse, or counting-house, office, store, garage, pavilion, factory, or workshop, or any building belonging to His Majesty or to any Government department, or to any municipal or other public authority, and commits any serious indictable offence therein, or 
           
           
          being in any dwelling-house, or any such building as aforesaid, or any school-house, shop, warehouse, or counting-house, office, store, garage, pavilion, factory or workshop, or any building belonging to His Majesty or to any Government department, or to any municipal or other public authority, commits any serious indictable offence therein and breaks out of the same, 
          
         
        shall be liable to imprisonment for fourteen years. 
         
         
        (2)  
        Aggravated offence 
         
        A person is guilty of an offence under this subsection if the person commits an offence under subsection (1) in circumstances of aggravation. A person convicted of an offence under this subsection is liable to imprisonment for 20 years. 
         
         
        (3) 
         Specially aggravated offence 
         
        A person is guilty of an offence under this subsection if the person commits an offence under subsection (2) in circumstances of special aggravation. A person convicted of an offence under this subsection is liable to imprisonment for 25 years. 
        
       
      
    13 For the purpose of s.112, among other sections, the expression “circumstances of aggravation” is defined as follows in s.105A of the Crimes Act: 
     
      
       
        
        105A Definitions 
         
        (1) In sections 106–115A:  
         
        circumstances of aggravation 
         means circumstances involving any one or more of the following:  
         
        (a) the alleged offender is armed with an offensive weapon, or instrument, 
         
        (b) the alleged offender is in the company of another person or persons, 
         
        (c) the alleged offender uses corporal violence on any person, 
         
        (d) the alleged offender maliciously inflicts actual bodily harm on any person, 
         
        (e) the alleged offender deprives any person of his or her liberty, 
         
        (f) the alleged offender knows that there is a person, or that there are persons, in the place where the offence is alleged to be committed. 
         
        circumstances of special aggravation 
         means circumstances involving either or both of the following:  
         
        (a) the alleged offender wounds or maliciously inflicts grievous bodily harm on any person, 
         
        (b) the alleged offender is armed with a dangerous weapon. 
         
         
        (2) The matters referred to in:  
         
        (a) paragraph (c), (d) or (e) of the definition of  
        circumstances of aggravation 
        , or 
         
        (b) paragraph (a) of the definition of  
        circumstances of special aggravation 
        , 
         
        can occur immediately before, or at the time of, or immediately after any of the elements of the offence concerned occurred. 
         
         
        (2A) For the purposes of paragraph (f) of the definition of  
        circumstances of aggravation 
        , if there was a person, or there were persons, in the place in relation to which an offence is alleged to have been committed at the time it was committed, the defendant is presumed to have known that fact unless the defendant satisfies the court that he or she had reasonable grounds for believing that there was no one in the place. 
         
         
        (3) The definitions in subsection (1) are not mutually exclusive. 
        
       
      
    14 The particular circumstances of aggravation specified in the case of each appellant were those in pars.(b) and (e) of the definition. The serious indictable offence that was also an element of the s.112 offence was robbery, an offence under s.94 of the Crimes Act carrying a maximum penalty in excess of 5 years: cf. definition of “serious indictable offence” in s.4 of the Crimes Act. 
     
      
       
      Submissions 
      
    15 Mr. Street SC for the appellant Styman submitted that his conviction on the charge of aggravated break and enter involved a conclusive determination that he deprived the deceased of her liberty, in circumstance where that deprivation of liberty continued until her death; and that this in substance coincided with the elements of the manslaughter with which she was charged before Studdert J. Accordingly, those elements merged in the conviction, and Studdert J should have upheld Styman’s entitlement to rely on a plea in bar to that charge. 
     
      
    16 Mr. Street referred to Pearce v. The Queen [1998] HCA 57, (1998) 194 CLR 610 at [18]-[26], and to Island Maritime Limited v. Filipowski [2006] HCA 30 at [25]-[30]; and he submitted that the latter case showed that a plea in bar of autrefois convict was available even where not all of the elements of the later charge were included in the former charge of which the accused was convicted.  
     
      
    17 Mr. Wendler for the appellant Taber adopted Mr. Street’s submissions. He drew our attention to the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v. Stone [2005] NSWCCA 344, to the effect that there must be a conviction and sentence before a plea in bar in the nature of autrefois convict can succeed; and he submitted that that decision should be limited to cases where the accused has pleaded guilty, and should not extend to cases where the accused was found guilty by a jury. 
     
      
    18 Mr. Wendler also submitted that, even if a plea in bar was not available, there was an abuse of process because the manslaughter prosecution was, in legal reality, a trial for a more serious offence on the same facts already determined in the conviction for aggravated break and enter: cf. R v. Beedie [1997] 2 Cr App R 167, [1998] QB 356.  
     
      
       
      Decision 
      
    19 It is true that R v. Stone was dealing with a case where the earlier conviction relied on arose from a plea of guilty; but the judgment of the court was expressed in general terms as applying also to cases where there has been a finding of guilt by a jury. However, since in my opinion the appellants cannot in any event succeed on the basis of autrefois convict or abuse of process, it is not necessary to consider whether R v. Stone should be distinguished.  
     
      
    20 In Pearce, the following appears: 
     
      
       
        
        18 It is clear that the plea in bar goes to offences the elements of which are the same as, or are included in, the elements of the offence for which an accused has been tried to conviction or acquittal. There are, however, decisions that a person may not be prosecuted for one offence when that person has previously been prosecuted for ""substantially the same"" offence, or for an offence the ""gist"" or ""gravamen"" of which is the same as the subject of the earlier prosecution or, as was said in  
        Wemyss v Hopkins 
         [(1875) LR 10 QB 378], for the ""same matter"". It may be suggested that these cases indicate that a plea in bar is also available if a person is charged with different offences arising out of substantially the same set of facts.  
         
         
        19 Much of the difficulty in determining whether a plea in bar is available when a person is charged with different offences arising out of substantially the same facts can be seen to stem from two sources: first, the uncertainties inherent in the proposition that it is enough that the offences are ""substantially"" the same; and secondly, the attempt to identify the ""sameness"" of two offences by reference to the evidence that would be adduced at trial. But these difficulties may be more apparent than real.  
         
         
        20 In each of  
        Chia Gee v Martin 
         [(1905) 3 CLR 649] and  
        Li Wan Quai v Christie 
         [(1906) 3 CLR 1125], Griffith CJ identified the test for whether a plea in bar would lie as being ""whether the evidence necessary to support the second [charge or prosecution] would have been sufficient to procure a legal conviction upon the first"". At first sight this might suggest that it is appropriate to consider what witnesses would be called and what each of those witnesses  
        could 
         say about the events which gave rise to the charges. Closer examination reveals that the enquiry suggested is different; it is an enquiry about what evidence would be  
        sufficient  
        to procure a legal conviction. That invites attention to what must be proved to establish commission of each of the offences. That is, it invites attention to identifying the elements of the offences, not to identifying which witnesses might be called or what they could say. It is only if attention is directed to what evidence might be given, as opposed to what evidence was necessary, that the enquiry begins to slide away from its proper focus upon identity of offence to focus upon whether the charges arise out of the same transaction or course of events.  
         
         
        21 Further, when it is said that it is enough if the offences are ""substantially"" the same, this should not be understood as inviting departure from an analysis of, and comparison between, the elements of the two offences under consideration.  
         
         
        22 In this respect  
        Wemyss  
        is capable of being misunderstood. Wemyss had been convicted at petty sessions of an offence that being the driver of a carriage he had ""by negligence or wilful misbehaviour, to wit, by striking a certain horse ridden"" by the respondent caused hurt and damage to her. He was then charged (again at petty sessions) with unlawful assault. The court held that, the offences being summary offences, a plea of autrefois convict was not available but that a defence ""in the nature of a plea of autrefois convict"" was. The judgments of the members of the court (which were given ex tempore) use various expressions which have later been seized on as sufficiently expressing the test of the availability of a plea in bar.  
         
         
        23 Thus Blackburn J speaks of ""proceedings for the same offence"" and punishment ""for the same matter""; Lush J speaks of prosecution ""twice for the same offence"" and conviction ""again for the same act""; Field J speaks of twice being ""punished for the same cause"". (Examination of other reports of the same case reveal even greater differences in expression.) But, all of these expressions must be understood in their context. Their differences should not obscure the fact that the elements of each offence alleged against Wemyss were identical. The enquiry made in  
        Wemyss 
         was an enquiry about the offences that had been alleged, not about what other offences the relevant statutes might create. Thus the case against Wemyss on the first prosecution appears to have been not a case of negligent conduct but one of ""wilful misbehaviour"" constituted by his intentionally striking the victim's horse. That being so, the court was satisfied that the case propounded on the second prosecution was identical with the case propounded on the first.  
         
         
        24 On closer analysis, therefore, it may be that  
        Wemyss  
        and other cases that are said to support the proposition that a plea in bar is available when a person is charged with different offences arising out of the same set of facts do not do so. Moreover, there are sound reasons to confine the availability of a plea in bar to cases in which the elements of the offences charged are identical or in which all of the elements of one offence are wholly included in the other.  
         
         
        25 Shifting attention to whether the offences arise out of the same conduct, or out of a single event or connected series of events, would be to substitute for a rule prohibiting prosecution twice for a single offence a rule that would require prosecuting authorities to bring at one time all the charges that it is sought to lay as a result of a single episode of offending. That would raise still further questions. How would a single episode of offending be defined? Would its limits be temporal or would they be founded in the intentions of the actor?  
         
         
        26 Those are not questions that admit of certain answers and, whatever criteria are adopted, are not questions that could readily be answered at the time an accused enters a plea. In any event, such a test would, as we have said, shift attention away from the principal focus of the rule underlying the pleas in bar which is a rule against repeated prosecution for a single offence. It would be a test which would deny operation to some or all of the three other forces at work in this area: that several different offences may be committed in the course of a single series of events, that an offender can be punished only for the offence charged, not some other offence, and that charges will usually be framed in a way that reflects all of the criminal conduct of the accused.  
        
       
      
    21 Island Maritime contains the following comments on these paragraphs: 
     
      
       
        
        26 Counsel for the respondent attacked one aspect of  
        Pearce v The Queen 
        . It was the part of the following passage in the joint judgment to which emphasis has been added:  
         
          
          ""It is clear that the plea in bar goes to offences the elements of which are the same as, or  
          are included in 
          , the elements of the offence for which an accused has been tried to conviction or acquittal.""  
          
         
        Counsel said that the words ""are included in"" should have been ""include"". When the passage is read in context, however, it is plain that the proposition which counsel for the respondent said the reasons for judgment should have asserted was in fact encompassed in what was said in  
        Pearce v The Queen 
        . There are three particular aspects of the context to note. 
         
         
        27 One aspect of the context is that the words ""are included in"" were succeeded by a footnote reference to  
        R v Elrington 
         (1861) 1 B & S 688, [121 ER 870].. In that case the accused was charged on information with common assault. He was acquitted by justices of the peace, who certified that the information was not proved and was dismissed. The accused was then prosecuted on indictment for assault causing grievous bodily harm and assault causing actual bodily harm. The Court of Queen's Bench (Cockburn CJ and Blackburn J) held that the relevant statute meant that the certificate could be pleaded in bar to the indictment. However, the significance of the case goes beyond the operation of the statute, for Cockburn CJ remarked:  
         
          
          ""[W]e must bear in mind the well established principle of our criminal law that a series of charges shall not be preferred, and, whether a party accused of a minor offence is acquitted or convicted, he shall not be charged again on the same facts in a more aggravated form.""  
          
         
        The elements of assault causing grievous bodily harm are not ""included in"" the elements of common assault, but the former elements do include the latter. 
         
         
        28 The second matter of context is the statement appearing a little later in the joint judgment in  
        Pearce v The Queen 
        :  
         
          
          ""[T]here are sound reasons to confine the availability of a plea in bar to cases in which the elements of the offences charged are identical or in which all of the elements of one offence are wholly included in the other.""  
          
         
        R v Elrington 
         was a case of that kind. 
         
         
        29 A third feature of the context is that in the footnote appearing next after the reference to  
        R v Elrington 
        , the joint judgment referred approvingly to  
        Li Wan Quai v Christie 
        . The explanation given of Griffith CJ's formulation of the test in that and other cases a little later in the joint reasons is consistent with the view that the joint judgment favoured acceptance of the plea of autrefois acquit where the elements of the offence charged second are the same as, or include, the elements of the offence charged first.  
         
         
        30 As the joint judgment pointed out, when Griffiths CJ said in  
        Li Wan Quai v Christie 
         that ""[t]he true test whether [a plea of autrefois acquit] is a sufficient bar in any particular case is, whether the evidence necessary to support the second charge would have been sufficient to procure a legal conviction upon the first"", his reference to ""evidence"" must be understood as a reference to the facts constituting the elements of the offence. One thing is clear. Griffith CJ was referring to a case, like  
        R v Elrington 
        , where the offence the subject of the second charge was, to use the words of Cockburn CJ, a more aggravated form of the offence the subject of the first charge. In the passage from  
        Li Wan Quai v Christie 
         just quoted, which was cited in  
        Pearce v The Queen 
        , Griffith CJ referred to the 21st edition of  
        Archbold's Criminal Pleading 
        . His statement of the ""true test"" was taken directly from  
        Archbold 
        , which, in turn, referred to  
        R v Elrington 
        . It cannot be that  
        Pearce v The Queen 
         was contradicting the propositions stated by Cockburn CJ and Griffith CJ. For our part, however, we find it unnecessary to decide whether the principle is wider than that stated in the older authorities, and whether it also covers a case in which the first prosecution was for the more aggravated form of offence and the second is for a lesser form. Such a case would be the reverse of that referred to by Cockburn CJ and Griffith CJ. These questions do not arise for decision.  
        
       
      
    22 Although it was submitted by the Crown before us that autrefois convict can apply only if all elements of the offence the subject of the later charge were included in elements of the offence for which the accused was convicted, there are indications to the contrary in these paragraphs. In particular, the quote from Elrington referred to in Island Maritime at [27] supports the view that, when a person has been either acquitted or convicted of assault, he should not be later charged with a aggravated form of assault.  
     
      
    23 On the other hand, the passages in Pearce make it clear that “several different offences may be committed in the course of a single series of events”; and that the rule as to autrefois convict is not intended to prevent a person being charged with offences that reflect all of the criminal conduct involved. The circumstance that there may be overlapping elements in these various offences would not mean that charges for all of them would be duplicitous, or that a conviction for one could give rise to a plea in bar in respect of others.  
     
      
    24 In this case, the most that can said is that there are overlapping elements. Aggravated break and enter involves elements not included in manslaughter, and manslaughter involves elements not included in aggravated break and enter. It may even be doubted whether deprivation of liberty of the deceased was one element of the offence of aggravated break and enter, as found by the jury, because another factor of aggravation (being in the company of another person or persons) was alleged; but even accepting that it was, the elements of death of the deceased and causation of that death were plainly not included.  
     
      
    25 Accordingly, even if a plea in bar of the nature of autrefois convict is available where there is a charge of a more aggravated form of the same offence for which the accused was previously convicted, that is not the case here: the charge of manslaughter is a charge for a quite different offence from that of aggravated break and enter, having different albeit possibly overlapping elements.  
     
      
    26 In my opinion also, the suggestion of abuse of process has no substance. It could not have been an abuse of process to charge the appellants with aggravated break and enter and manslaughter. They were in fact charged with aggravated break and enter and murder. Their conviction for murder was overturned, and a new trial ordered. Although there was a discretion in the Director of Public Prosecutions whether or not to proceed with the charge of manslaughter, it borders on absurdity to suggest that it was an abuse of process to do so.  
     
      
       
      HEARSAY EVIDENCE OF SHANNON STYMAN 
      
    27 This issue raises questions under ss.65, 83, 137 and the explanation of “not available” in cl.4(1) of the dictionary of the Evidence Act 1995, which are in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        65 Exception: criminal proceedings if maker not available 
         
        (1) This section applies in a criminal proceeding if a person who made a previous representation is not available to give evidence about an asserted fact. 
         
        (2) The hearsay rule does not apply to evidence of a previous representation that is given by a person who saw, heard or otherwise perceived the representation being made, if the representation was:  
         
          
          (a) made under a duty to make that representation or to make representations of that kind, or 
           
          (b) made when or shortly after the asserted fact occurred and in circumstances that make it unlikely that the representation is a fabrication, or 
           
          (c) made in circumstances that make it highly probable that the representation is reliable, or 
           
          (d) against the interests of the person who made it at the time it was made. 
          
         
        (3) The hearsay rule does not apply to evidence of a previous representation made in the course of giving evidence in an Australian or overseas proceeding if, in that proceeding, the defendant in the proceeding to which this section is being applied:  
         
          
          (a) cross-examined the person who made the representation about it, or 
           
          (b) had a reasonable opportunity to cross-examine the person who made the representation about it. 
          
         
        (4) If there is more than one defendant in the criminal proceeding, evidence of a previous representation that:  
         
          
          (a) is given in an Australian or overseas proceeding, and 
           
          (b) is admitted into evidence in the criminal proceeding because of subsection (3), 
           
          cannot be used against a defendant who did not cross-examine, and did not have a reasonable opportunity to cross-examine, the person about the representation. 
          
         
        (5) For the purposes of subsections (3) and (4), a defendant is taken to have had a reasonable opportunity to cross-examine a person if the defendant was not present at a time when the cross-examination of a person might have been conducted but:  
         
          
          (a) could reasonably have been present at that time, and 
           
          (b) if present could have cross-examined the person. 
          
         
        (6) Evidence of the making of a representation to which subsection (3) applies may be adduced by producing a transcript, or a recording, of the representation that is authenticated by:  
         
          
          (a) the person to whom, or the court or other body to which, the representation was made, or 
           
          (b) if applicable, the registrar or other proper officer of the court or other body to which the representation was made, or 
           
          (c) the person or body responsible for producing the transcript or recording. 
          
         
        (7) Without limiting subsection (2) (d), a representation is taken for the purposes of that subsection to be against the interests of the person who made it if it tends:  
         
          
          (a) to damage the person’s reputation, or 
           
          (b) to show that the person has committed an offence for which the person has not been convicted, or 
           
          (c) to show that the person is liable in an action for damages. 
          
         
        (8) The hearsay rule does not apply to:  
         
          
          (a) evidence of a previous representation adduced by a defendant if the evidence is given by a person who saw, heard or otherwise perceived the representation being made, or 
           
          (b) a document tendered as evidence by a defendant so far as it contains a previous representation, or another representation to which it is reasonably necessary to refer in order to understand the representation. 
          
         
        (9) If evidence of a previous representation about a matter has been adduced by a defendant and has been admitted, the hearsay rule does not apply to evidence of another representation about the matter that:  
         
          
          (a) is adduced by another party, and 
           
          (b) is given by a person who saw, heard or otherwise perceived the other representation being made. 
          
         
         
        83 Exclusion of evidence of admissions as against third parties 
         
        (1) Section 81 does not prevent the application of the hearsay rule or the opinion rule to evidence of an admission in respect of the case of a third party. 
         
        (2) The evidence may be used in respect of the case of a third party if that party consents. 
         
        (3) Consent cannot be given in respect of part only of the evidence. 
         
        (4) In this section:  
         
        third party 
         means a party to the proceeding concerned, other than the party who:  
         
          
          (a) made the admission, or 
           
          (b) adduced the evidence. 
          
         
         
        137 Exclusion of prejudicial evidence in criminal proceedings 
         
        In a criminal proceeding, the court must refuse to admit evidence adduced by the prosecutor if its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant. 
         
         
        4 Unavailability of persons 
         
        (1) For the purposes of this Act, a person is taken not to be available to give evidence about a fact if:  
         
          
          (a) the person is dead, or 
           
          (b) the person is, for any reason other than the application of section 16 (Competence and compellability: judges and jurors), not competent to give the evidence about the fact, or 
           
          (c) it would be unlawful for the person to give evidence about the fact, or 
           
          (d) a provision of this Act prohibits the evidence being given, or 
           
          (e) all reasonable steps have been taken, by the party seeking to prove the person is not available, to find the person or to secure his or her attendance, but without success, or 
           
          (f) all reasonable steps have been taken, by the party seeking to prove the person is not available, to compel the person to give the evidence, but without success. 
          
         
        
       
      
    28 At the previous trial before Barr J, Shannon Styman gave evidence in his defence that implicated the appellants as being parties to what happened to the deceased, and he was cross-examined by the Crown Prosecutor and by Counsel for each of the appellants.  
     
      
    29 In the course of the Crown case before Studdert J, Shannon Styman was called and went into the witness box, but he refused to give evidence concerning the facts of the case. The Crown then applied to have his evidence given before Barr J admitted. The primary judge held that Shannon Styman was not available within the meaning of that expression in s.65(1), because cl.4(1)(f) of the dictionary applied; and held that his evidence fell within s.65(3). He held that the notice provision in s.67 of the Evidence Act was not a bar to admission of the evidence; and then he addressed the question of the application of s.137 of the Act (it being clear that if the evidence qualified for admission under s.137, it would also satisfy the requirements of s.135).  
     
      
    30 He summarised the evidence given by Shannon Styman as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        28 The evidence give by Shannon Styman at the earlier trial is evidence that goes directly to the involvement of the accused in the events that occurred at the home of the deceased on the occasion that her home was invaded, the robbery occurred and the deceased was left bound and gagged. In short, Shannon Styman’s evidence previously given was to the effect that the three men went to the house together after the accused told him of a previous unsuccessful attempt that they had made to break into the home of the deceased. According to Shannon Styman, when the three men went to the house, entry was gained through the back door when the accused Peter Taber used a sawn-down key to open that door. His evidence was that Peter Taber told him his part would be to restrain the deceased whilst Peter Taber and Ian Styman found the money in the house. His evidence was that the three men wore gloves when they entered the house, that Peter Taber took some “ladies undies” off the clothesline and that these were used when gagging the deceased. He gave evidence describing how the three men participated in gagging and binding the deceased and he said that whilst he held her down on the bed, the accused now before the Court made a search. He gave evidence that one of the cable ties on the deceased’s hand was too tight and he called Ian Styman back into the bedroom and one of the cable ties was cut off, being replaced by duct tape. He said he saw Ian Styman find a bag, a black purse and a brown paper bag that contained money. The money having been discovered, the men left the house leaving the deceased bound and gagged on the bed in her bedroom. 
        
       
      
    31 The primary judge noted that this evidence was relevant to facts in issue in the case. He referred to a number of authorities. He noted that Shannon Styman was an accomplice, so the customary warning that his evidence may be unreliable would be given; and that the jury had seen him refuse to give evidence. He then referred to circumstantial evidence that lent some support to Shannon Styman’s version of events. 
     
      
    32 The primary judge noted that he had to undertake the weighing process of probative value against the danger of unfair prejudice; and he noted the following matters put forward by Counsel for the appellants as being prejudicial:  
     
      
       
        
        (i) The accused will not be able to confront one of the most important witnesses in the case. Mr Wendler submitted: “It is fundamental in any criminal trial that the accused be permitted to confront his accuser and he [that is, Shannon Styman] is an accuser” (T 669); 
         
         
        (ii) If Shannon Styman’s version is to be introduced in the way in which the Crown seeks to introduce it, the jury will be deprived of the opportunity of assessing his demeanour; 
         
         
        (iii) Shannon Styman is, on his own account, to be regarded as an accomplice and this, of course, raises the issue of unreliability; 
         
         
        (iv) Mr Wendler submitted that although he had the opportunity of cross examining Shannon Styman at the earlier trial, he was prevented from cross examining him on his antecedents, and Shannon Styman has a significant criminal history, including offences of stealing motor vehicles and break enter and steal. Had Shannon Styman been called at the present trial, Mr Wendler could have cross examined him on his record, and this would have affected his credibility; 
         
         
        (v) If Shannon Styman’s version is admitted, the Crown will have the advantage of using that version against the accused for the purpose of cross examination, and the accused did not have a corresponding advantage when cross examining Shannon Styman in the previous proceedings. 
        
       
      
    33 The primary judge discussed these points, and concluded that the evidence should be admitted. He directed that no transcript of the evidence given by Shannon Styman should go into the jury room, but that the evidence should be read to the jury. 
     
      
       
      Submissions 
      
    34 Mr. Street submitted that s.65 of the Evidence Act was intended to apply to prosecution witnesses, not to evidence given by a co-accused. He submitted that ALRC report 38 par.128 envisaged the use of previous representations under s.65(3) in the context of a prosecution case, and not evidence of a co-accused; and par.152(d) made it clear that an admission should not be admissible against a co-party without the co-party’s consent, this being enacted by s.82(2) of the Evidence Act.  
     
      
    35 In addition, Mr. Street submitted that the primary judge erred in taking into account irrelevant considerations, notably the conviction of the appellants for offences under s.112 of the Crimes Act, and the circumstantial evidence that the primary judge said lent support to the evidence. Mr. Street submitted that the primary judge should have focussed on the probative value of the evidence itself, and weighed that probative value against its substantial prejudicial effect.  
     
      
    36 Mr. Street submitted that the evidence was highly prejudicial, for the following reasons: 
     
      
      (1) Much of the evidence was given in response to leading questions put in cross-examination by the Crown (this being a relevant consideration not taken into account by the primary judge). 
       
      (2) The likelihood that the jury would misuse the evidence, being unable to assess the impact of cross-examination where that material was only read to them. 
       
      (3) The Crown had opened the case to the effect that it would lead evidence from Shannon Styman, even though it was then aware that the witness would not co-operate. 
       
      (4) The account given by Shannon Styman was adapted to conform to what was understood to be the correct timing of mobile phone calls at the time of the trial before Barr J; whereas at the time of the trial before Studdert J it was known that this timing was out by one hour; and there was never an opportunity to explore the discrepancies that this involved in cross-examination of Shannon Styman. 
       
      
    37 Mr. Wendler submitted that the primary judge erred in deciding that the probative value of the evidence was not outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice; and this resulted in a miscarriage of justice for the following reasons: 
     
      
      (1) The ruling created an atmosphere which precipitated an unacceptable risk of miscarriage of justice, having the practical legal effect of forensically disarming the defence of both appellants. 
       
      (2) The ruling dispossessed the defence of any forensic capacity in respect of the main prosecution witness. 
       
      (3) The ruling denied the appellants the opportunity to confront their accuser.  
       
      (4) The ruling infiltrated the trial with an artificial atmosphere: the transcript took about seven hours to read, and there was no way of knowing which parts read from the transcript the jury absorbed and which parts it lost because of sensory overload.  
       
      (5) The ruling gave the Crown the advantage of the fruits of its cross-examination of Shannon Styman in the previous trial, and the advantage of putting its case in cross-examination to the appellants when they gave evidence; whereas the appellants did not have the opportunity of putting their case in cross-examination of the main Prosecution witness.  
       
      (6) The ruling dispossessed the jury of any realistic basis to assess the credibility and reliability of the main Prosecution witness. 
       
      (7) The jury could think there had been a previous trial at which the appellants had been convicted. 
       
       
      Decision 
      
    38 In my opinion, there is no sufficient reason for reading down s.65 so that it would apply only to prosecution witnesses: the words are clear and in their terms extend to the evidence of a co-accused. If evidence is admitted under s.65, it does not have to satisfy the requirements for admissibility as an admission, which is dealt with in s.82(2). There was no submission before us that the requirement that the witness be not available was not satisfied, or that the evidence should not be admitted by reason of the notice provisions in s.67.  
     
      
    39 The primary judge, in recording the background to the application to have the evidence admitted under s.65, did record that the appellants had been convicted of murder and what the primary judge called aggravated robbery, and that, while the conviction for murder was set aside, only the sentence for aggravated robbery was set aside. However, in my opinion there is no indication that the primary judge relied on that as supporting his decision as to whether the evidence should be admitted having regard to s.137.  
     
      
    40 Some of the considerations advanced before this Court were not explicitly addressed by the primary judge, in particular the circumstances that some of Shannon Styman’s evidence was given in response to leading questions by the Crown, that the Crown had opened to the effect that Shannon Styman would give evidence, that there was no opportunity to cross-examine Shannon Styman on errors associated with earlier misapprehension as to the time of the mobile telephone calls (the failure to make the adjustment for daylight saving), and that the jury could have thought there had been a previous trial at which the appellants had been convicted. However, it was not suggested that these considerations were expressly put to the primary judge; and in my opinion they are not such that it could be said the primary judge was in error in not addressing them explicitly.  
     
      
    41 The decision of the primary judge was appropriately reasoned, and those reasons do not suggest that the primary judge made any error in deciding the questions posed by s.137. The decision is one of fact, degree and impression, and so should not be subject to appellate intervention unless the appeal court considers it to be wrong. In my opinion, the decision is not shown to be wrong. The evidence of Shannon Styman was of substantial probative value, and it was very much a matter for the jury to assess how much weight should be given to it. There was some danger of prejudice through misuse of the evidence by the jury, but that danger could be minimised by appropriate directions. No complaint has been made about directions given by the primary judge.  
     
      
    42 For those reasons, in my opinion this ground of appeal fails.  
     
      
       
      UNREASONABLE VERDICT 
      
    43 In order to assess the contention that the verdict was unreasonable, it is helpful first to outline some facts that were not subject to any significant dispute, and then to outline some of the main evidence that was led on both sides relating to matters that were in dispute. 
     
      
    44 Greenwell Point, where the deceased lived, was to the east and a little to the south of Nowra, and about 9-10 kilometres from Nowra. The appellant Taber lived at 211 Old Southern Road, Warragee, a suburb of Nowra to the south-east, on the road to Greenwell Point. The appellant Styman lived at Sanctuary Point, about 20-25 kilometres south of Nowra on St. George’s Basin. Shannon Styman lived at Old Erowal Bay, also on St. George’s Basin and about one kilometre from the appellant Styman’s house. There was also some evidence about the house of Taber’s mother, which was in Jervis Street in Nowra.  
     
      
    45 There was undisputed evidence that the deceased hoarded cash and had a lot of $100 notes. In 1999, she lent her niece Melinda Ravell $23,500.00 in cash, and in 2000 she lent her sister Cheryl Ravell $22,000.00 in cash.  
     
      
    46 The appellant Taber had moved into the house at Warragee in about September 2000. That house was then occupied by Leonie Ravell, a niece of the deceased (and sister of Melinda Ravell and daughter of Cheryl Ravell); and Taber then shared the main bedroom of that house with her.  
     
      
    47 On 22 December 2000, Taber called Melinda and asked to borrow $2,000.00 from her for a holiday in Queensland; and Melinda refused this request.  
     
      
    48 On 24 December 2000, the deceased reported to police an attempted break-in at her house on the previous night.  
     
      
    49 On 7 January 2001, at 4.25am (daylight saving time) there was a 9 second call from Taber’s mobile phone to Ian Styman’s mobile phone, picked up at the Nowra tower (this being consistent with the call being made either from Greenwell Point or from Nowra).  
     
      
    50 At 4.54am on that morning, Ian Styman made a triple 0 call from a telephone box in East Nowra, about 9 kilometres from the deceased’s house, in which he asked for a car to be sent to Spies Avenue, Greenwell Point saying “There was a couple of blokes that went in there with guns, second house from the corner … there’s a little old lady there”. No response was sent to this call, apparently because the call was considered a hoax.  
     
      
    51 Between 6.30am and 7.00am that morning, Taber, Leonie Ravell, Ian Styman and Shannon Styman travelled to Sydney in Taber’s mother’s car. At Sydney, Taber purchased a Ford utility for $1,400.00 cash, including old $100 notes; and Ian Styman bought a 4-wheel driver Suzuki for $4,300.00 cash, including old $100 notes.  
     
      
    52 On 8 January 2000, Shannon Styman purchased a Honda motor cycle for $900.00, made up of old $50 notes. Also on that day, one David Bennett installed a security door on the back door of the deceased’s house. He found the back door ajar, but did not go inside. He locked the security door and left after fitting it. 
     
      
    53 On 19 January 2000, the deceased’s body was found. Her ankles and wrists were tied with cable ties and grey/silver duct tape; there was a pillow slip over her head held by duct tape; and there were panties in her mouth held by duct tape. There was no signed of forced entry into the house.  
     
      
    54 Important evidence in the Crown case included the following.  
     
      
    55 There was the evidence given by Shannon Styman at the previous trial, read to the jury. The trial judge’s summary of the broad effect of this evidence was given above. I will however set out some of the details of that evidence.  
     
      
    56 Shannon Styman’s evidence included evidence that on 4 January 2001, Ian Styman took him to Taber’s mother’s house, where they met Taber. Taber said his girlfriend’s aunt lived at Greenwell Point and had enough money to buy a house; that he and Ian Styman had gone there to try to break in and were unsuccessful because the lady woke up; and that they had gone there once with Andrew Peake dressed as security guards and had used a key to get in via the back door.  
     
      
    57 His evidence was that on 5 January 2001, Ian Styman took Shannon Styman to Taber’s house, where they discussed using cable ties and duct tape to tie the lady up, and Taber produced a key which Ian Styman said he had modified into a skeleton key.  
     
      
    58 His evidence was that on 6 January 2001 Ian Styman took Shannon Styman to Taber’s house at about 12.30pm to 1.30pm; that Ian Styman took Shannon Styman home at about 3.30pm with an arrangement to pick him up at about 6.30pm. Ian Styman did so, and took him to Taber’s house; and the three of them left in Taber’s mother’s car at about 8.30pm to 9.30pm, at which time Leonie Ravell was in bed. They drove to Greenwell Point, drove past the deceased’s house, drove to a reserve where they stayed 1-2 hours, drove back past the house where they saw a light on, drove to the wharf, then drove back to the house, tried the key and it worked. They decided not to go into the house immediately. 
     
      
    59 His evidence was that about 4am on 7 January they went inside. They tied up the deceased in her bedroom. Ian Styman and Taber searched the room, and money was found in a paper bag. They left by the back door. They were in the house about 20 minutes, and had gloves on the whole time. Ian made the triple 0 call from the first phone box they came to on the way back to Taber’s house. They went to Taber’s house and counted the money. There was $23,300.00. Shannon Styman received $2,300.00, Ian Styman received $7,000.00, and Taber received $14,000.00 of which $7,000.00 was given to Leonie Ravell.  
     
      
    60 In the cross-examination contained in that evidence, Shannon Styman admitted he was a skilful liar, and agreed that he had lied to police in four interviews.  
     
      
    61 Evidence was given by Andrew Peake, a friend of Ian Styman. He said that one day in early December 2000 he had lunch with Ian Styman, and that they then went to Taber’s house, after which Peake followed Ian Styman and Taber to Taber’s mother’s house. He went into that house and found them tying each other up with cable ties. The three of them then dressed in blue shirts with ties and at about 7pm, drove in Taber’s mother’s car to Greenwell Point. They went into a pub, then Peake drove the car to near the RSL club and dropped the other two off. About 15-20 minutes later, Peake received a call from Ian Styman asking him to pick them up again at the RSL club, which he did. 
     
      
    62 Evidence was given of a search of Taber’s house on 24 January 2001. Among other things, police officers gave evidence of finding two pieces of used duct tape in the back of Taber’s utility, this being the one purchased on 7 January 2001. There was forensic evidence that the deceased’s DNA was found on this tape.  
     
      
    63 Evidence was given by one Donyelle Turner that she moved in with Leonie Ravell and Taber a couple of days before Christmas 2000. She heard Taber ask Leonie if her sister would lend money for a Queensland holiday, after which Taber used his mobile phone and then said that the sister could not lend the money. Taber then suggested that they ask Leonie’s aunt; and Taber and Leonie Ravell went off in Taber’s mother’s car, returning a couple of hours later. According tof this evidence, Leonie Ravell was annoyed that her aunt had not lent them money, and said “Well we could always kill her”; to which Taber said they would not get away with it. 
     
      
    64 Evidence was led of an interview with Taber on 24 January 2001, in which Taber said the money he had spent on the utility and other items was money he had saved. He was also asked about duct tape, and in the course of those questions he said “You also found some in the back of me ute”.  
     
      
    65 Evidence was led of an interview with Ian Styman on 3 and 26 March 2001. He said he was not out on the night of 6-7 January 2001. He said he paid for the Suzuki 4-wheel drive with money accumulated from his work. 
     
      
    66 There was evidence of conversations recorded on listening devices, in one of which Taber was recorded as saying concerning duct tape “there was like two balls of it screwed up in the back of me ute, cos we tape all the stuff together with it”.  
     
      
    67 Taber gave sworn evidence before the jury and was cross-examined. He denied the evidence given by Peake. He said there was no conversation in front of Ms. Turner concerning borrowing from Leonie’s aunt and no approach made to the deceased to borrow money. He said that on 6 January 2001, Shannon Styman had left his house at about 6.15pm in his mother’s car, and that Ian Styman had left at about 8.30pm-8.45pm on his motor bike. He stayed up that night playing computer games in the lounge room.  
     
      
    68 Taber’s evidence was that at about 3am-4am on 7 January 2001, Shannon Styman came to his house and said that he had done over a drug dealer. Taber then telephoned Ian Styman (recorded at 4.25am) and arranged to meet him across from a Honda shop not far from his house; and Ian Styman came there 10-15 minutes later. The three of them then went back to Taber’s house and at that time Shannon Styman said that he “did an old bag” and said he had tied her up. They went to a phone box, and Ian Styman made the triple 0 call. They then put stuff from the car apparently taken from the deceased’s house into a bag, weighed it down with a brick, and it was thrown into the river from Nowra Bridge. 
     
      
    69 According to Taber’s evidence, then he, together with Leonie Ravell, Ian Styman and Shannon Styman drove to Sydney. In a car yard at Lansvale, Shannon Styman gave him $5,000.00 in cash, some of which he used to buy the utility. Later on he gave $1,500.00 of this to Leonie.  
     
      
    70 Taber said he had no recollection of any pieces of tape in his utility.  
     
      
    71 Ian Styman gave evidence before the jury and was cross-examined. He denied the evidence given by Peake. He said he left Taber’s house on 6 January 2001 at 8.30pm-9pm. He was at home when he received a call in the early hours of 7 January from Taber, in which Taber said that Shannon Styman had done something stupid. He went on his motor bike to meet Taber and Shannon Styman near the Honda shop. His account of what happened then was similar to that of Taber’s. When they went to Sydney, Shannon Styman gave him $5,000.00 in cash in a Lansvale car yard. He used some of this to buy the Suzuki motor vehicle.  
     
      
    72 The appropriate test for determining whether a verdict is unreasonable is that established by M v. The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487 at 493-95 (endorsed in Jones v. The Queen (1997) 191 CLR 439 at 450-52): 
     
      
       
        
        Where, notwithstanding that as a matter of law there is evidence to sustain a verdict, a court of criminal appeal is asked to conclude that the verdict is unsafe or unsatisfactory, the question which the court must ask itself is whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty. But in answering that question the court must not disregard or discount either the consideration that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, or the consideration that the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses. On the contrary, the court must pay full regard to those considerations.

        In most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced. It is only where a jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a court of criminal appeal that the court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred. That is to say, where the evidence lacks credibility for reasons which are not explained by the manner in which it was given, a reasonable doubt experienced by the court is a doubt which a reasonable jury ought to have experienced. If the evidence, upon the record itself, contains discrepancies, displays inadequacies, is tainted or otherwise lacks probative force in such a way as to lead the court of criminal appeal to conclude that, even making full allowance for the advantages enjoyed by the jury, there is a significant possibility that an innocent person has been convicted, then the court is bound to act and to set aside a verdict based upon that evidence. In doing so, the court is not substituting trial by a court of appeal for trial by jury, for the ultimate question must always be whether the court thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty. 
        
       
       
      Submissions 
      
    73 The following submissions were advanced by Mr. Wendler for Taber, and were adopted by Mr. Street, for Ian Styman.  
     
      
    74 Mr. Wendler submitted that Shannon Styman’s evidence could not be relied on. He gave in effect six different accounts of his involvement in the robbery of the deceased, originally saying he had absolutely no involvement. Later he said “I went in got the cash”; and later again he gave another account but refused to name accomplices. He said he only commenced to co-operate with police “when I found out I was going to be charged with murder”. The version of his involvement which he gave in examination in chief was different from that which he gave in cross-examination.  
     
      
    75 Shannon Styman said that Taber and Ian Styman used their teeth to cut the duct tape while applying the tape to gag the deceased; but despite extensive forensic testing of the tape, no DNA of the appellants was discovered. Mr. Wendler submitted that an example of the absurdity of his evidence was that, at a time when according to him the deceased was gagged and had a pillow case over her head, Taber asked her to “tell us where the money is and we won’t hurt you”.  
     
      
    76 Later on, Shannon Styman had told his partner Nadia Don that he had “robbed a drug dealer”; and that was, according to the testimony of both the appellants, the explanation given to them by Shannon following his unannounced arrival at Taber’s home in the early hours of 7 January 2001. His evidence was that the proceeds of the robbery were divided between himself, the appellants and Leonie Ravell; but Leonie Ravell did not testify that she received or was involved in the division of the robbery. 
     
      
    77 Mr. Wendler submitted that Shannon Styman was unable to give an adequate account of what he and the appellants were doing for six and a half hours at Greenwell Point prior to their alleged entry into the home of the deceased at about 4am on 7 January 2001.  
     
      
    78 He submitted that mobile phone records were capable of rebutting his evidence that he was with the appellants on the afternoon of 4 January 2001 when he alleged there were conversations concerning the planning of the robbery. He submitted that the mobile phone evidence contradicted Shannon Styman’s evidence that he used his mobile phone shortly after leaving the deceased’s house: because of the correction for daylight saving time, the call was not made until about one hour later.  
     
      
    79 He submitted that both appellants testified that they observed items of jewellery in the back seat of Taber’s mother’s car which Taber had lent to Shannon on the afternoon preceding the robbery; and Nadia Don confirmed that Shannon had given her some rings which turned out to be too small for her. The appellants’ contention was that these rings formerly belonged to the deceased. 
     
      
    80 Mr. Wendler submitted that the evidence of Andrew Peake was wholly unreliable. His evidence was that the episode he described occurred in early December 2000; and it was unequivocally demonstrated through mobile phone records that he was not in the Nowra area in early December. Taber’s father gave evidence to the effect that he would have been at home at the time Peake alleged the episode took place, and that he never saw Peake at the home. Peake gave Ian Styman’s wife a different account of where the tying-up episode took place, saying that it took place in the garage.  
     
      
    81 Further, Mr. Wendler submitted, the actual description of the episode was a nonsense, suggesting that the two men were tying each other up. 
     
      
    82 Mr. Wendler submitted that the evidence of Donnyelle Turner was wholly unreliable, because, by her own evidence, she was intoxicated by Indian hemp and consumed the drug every day whilst staying at the Old Southern Road house. 
     
      
    83 As regards the finding of the duct tape in the tray of the Ford Utility, Mr. Wendler submitted that the video of that discovery was capable of suggesting that the police knew the tape was there because it had been previously put there by police. The witness Megan Hearne testified that she saw a police officer approach the Ford and appear to handle some duct tape in the rear of the vehicle. The duct tape appeared to be of shiny and new appearance which, the defence suggested, was inconsistent with it having been in the rear of the utility between 7 and 24 January 2001.  
     
      
    84 Mr. Wendler submitted that the appellants gave sworn evidence, which they adhered to, exculpating themselves from involvement in the robbery.  
     
      
       
      Decision 
      
    85 Dealing first with Peake’s evidence, although there were problems with it, the jury could reasonably have accepted that incidents occurred substantially as described by Peake, albeit later in December than Peake believed. The jury could reasonably have accepted the evidence as being substantially true, rather than being either grossly mistaken or fabricated. Peake’s evidence had some support from Ian Styman’s wife, who saw both appellants wearing blue business shirts in about December 2000.  
     
      
    86 If the jury accepted the substance of Peake’s evidence, this was very damaging evidence against both appellants. It associated them both with preparations for the robbery, and was denied by both of them in circumstances where their denial could hardly itself be mistaken (that is, the denial was either true or deliberately false).  
     
      
    87 The evidence of Donnyelle Turner was attacked on the basis of her cannabis use, and the contrary evidence of Leonie Ravell. However, on the Crown case, Leonie Ravell, although a Crown witness, was living with Taber and was involved in the offence at least to the extent of being given $7,000.00 when the money was divided, and the jury could reasonably have rejected her evidence on this aspect of the case. It could also reasonably have accepted Ms. Turner’s evidence as being substantially true rather than either grossly mistaken or fabricated, particularly when her evidence about the approach to Melinda for a loan was not disputed.  
     
      
    88 If Ms. Turner’s evidence was accepted as substantially true, it was very damaging evidence against Taber: it associated him with an approach to the deceased to obtain money shortly before the robbery; and Taber’s denial on oath of any conversation about borrowing money from the deceased or any approach to the deceased could not plausibly be mistaken: the denial was either true or deliberately false. 
     
      
    89 The inculpation of Taber by this evidence also tends to inculpate Ian Styman, because if Taber was involved with Shannon Styman in the robbery, Ian Styman’s account of how he was phoned by Taber and told “Shannon has done something stupid” would be strongly discredited, as would be his account of being given $5,000.00 in Sydney by Shannon Styman.  
     
      
    90 There is some force in criticisms of police evidence concerning the finding of the duct tape in Taber’s utility; but these criticisms are far from decisive, and it was very much a matter for the jury to assess whether this police evidence was reliable. The police evidence had some support from Taber’s own statements about the duct tape. If the jury accepted the police evidence, as it could reasonably have done, that evidence and the DNA evidence concerning the tape was powerful evidence implicating Taber. The journey to Sydney to purchase the utility occurred immediately after whatever Taber was doing on the early morning of 7 January 2001, so it is not implausible that he may have had excess pieces of duct tape in his pockets which he later emptied into the rear of the utility. 
     
      
    91 On any reasonable view of the evidence, Taber and Ian Styman each had at least $5,000.00 of the money taken from the deceased’s house; and their explanation of how they came to have it was highly implausible. It meant that Shannon Styman must have conceived the breaking and entering and the robbery, although he had no connection with the deceased and no direct means of knowledge of her circumstances; he must have been able to enter her house without forcible entry; he must have tied up the deceased either by himself or in the company of some other person he did not tell the appellants about and who disappeared; and he must have then given them each $5,000.00 for no reason they could suggest. Their evidence also required an explanation of how a 9 second phone call from Taber to Ian Styman at 4.25am led Ian Styman to being in a position to make the triple 0 call in East Nowra 29 minutes later, this involving Ian Styman receiving the call at 4.25am, understanding what was being said inside 9 seconds and asking for no explanation, and getting from St. George’s Basin to Nowra (20-25 kilometres) in 10-15 minutes.  
     
      
    92 Thus, quite apart from Shannon Styman’s evidence, there was a strong circumstantial case against the appellants. There is force in criticisms of Shannon Styman’s evidence as read to the jury; but the substance of its content was plausible and fitted well with other evidence and with the probabilities.  
     
      
    93 In all these circumstances, in my opinion it was plainly open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the appellants. 
     
      
       
      SENTENCES 
       
      Submissions 
      
    94 Mr. Street for Styman submitted that sentence failed to take into account the very significant factor of the triple 0 call. Styman made the call in such a way as to ensure it would be acted on, reasonably believed it would be acted on, and clearly intended that it would secure the release of the victim. The judge’s criticisms that there were lies in the call and that there was no follow-up call do not affect this: lies were told (for example, about guns) to increase priority, and it was reasonable for Styman to believe the call had been effective. The Crown’s failure to call the person responsible for the decision not to act on the triple 0 call confirmed that this belief was reasonable. There was a public interest in encouraging such calls.  
     
      
    95 Mr. Street submitted that the sentence for manslaughter was manifestly excessive and more proportionate to murder. It was not in the worst category of manslaughter cases, and a proper weighing of sentencing criteria would result in a sentence of an order of 8 to 10 years. The sentence for aggravated break and enter was infected by the same errors; and a proper weighing of sentencing criteria would result in a sentence of 6 to 8 years.  
     
      
    96 Further, Mr. Street submitted, the primary judge did not take into account that Styman was in protective custody. There was no proper basis for anything other than concurrent sentences: the primary judge should have explicitly avoided punishing Styman twice for the deprivation of the deceased’s liberty.  
     
      
    97 Mr. Street submitted that there were special circumstances justifying a lesser non-parole period, namely the triple 0 call and the fact that Styman was in protective custody.  
     
      
    98 Mr. Wendler made similar submissions for Taber, and also pointed out that this was Taber’s first time in custody. He also submitted that Taber had a justifiable sense of grievance, having regard to the lesser sentence received by Shannon Styman, who made no contribution to the triple 0 call, had a previous history of breaking and entering, and committed the offence while on parole. 
     
      
       
      Decision 
      
    99 The primary judge did accept that the making of the triple 0 call was a circumstance to be taken into account; and it is not to the point that he did not refer to it as a mitigating circumstance when specifically referring to s.21A(3) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, since it did not fall with any of the paragraphs of that sub-section. It did not fall with paragraph (m), because it was not made for the purpose of assisting law enforcement authorities. The judge’s comments to the effect that the call was incomplete and false, and that the lack of any follow-up showed indifference to the deceased’s fate, were apposite; and they do not suggest that the judge did not give appropriate weight to the call as a mitigating factor.  
     
      
    100 Indeed, as submitted by the Crown, but for the call the crime would have been in the worst category of manslaughter; and it was only by reason of that call that the appellants’ convictions for murder were set aside.  
     
      
    101 The primary judge referred to protective custody, and said he did take into account the conditions of the appellants’ custody. In circumstances where there was no evidence as to what was likely to happen in the future, there was no need for further elaboration.  
     
      
    102 In my opinion, having regard to the cruelty shown towards the deceased and the suffering inflicted on her, and the appellants’ complete lack of remorse, it cannot be said that the sentences were manifestly excessive. As pointed out by the primary judge, circumstances that may constitute the crime of manslaughter are so varied that little assistance is to be derived from sentences in other cases. Similar comments apply to the aggravated break and enter, noting (as did the primary judge) that the appellants must not be punished twice for common elements of the offence. The primary judge did take account of the common elements of the offences in determining the extent to which the sentences would be concurrent; and he noted that the element of taking money from the deceased was not included in the elements of manslaughter, and that the death of the deceased was not included in the aggravated break and enter. In those circumstances, in my opinion his making the sentences largely concurrent, but cumulative to the extent of one year, was appropriate.  
     
      
    103 No ground is shown to alter the proportion of the non-parole period.  
     
      
    104 In my opinion, the argument from parity based on Shannon Styman’s sentence has no merit. Shannon Styman was enlisted into the commission of this offence by the appellants, he pleaded guilty to aggravated break and enter and offered a plea of guilty to the manslaughter charge of which he was convicted, and he showed remorse.  
     
      
       
      CONCLUSION 
      
    105 Accordingly, I propose the following orders in each case: 
     
      
      1. Appeal against conviction dismissed. 
       
      2. Leave to appeal against sentence granted, and appeal against sentence dismissed.

     Judgment 
      
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with Hall J. 
     
      
    2 HOWIE J: I agree with Hall J. 
     
      
    3 HALL J: The applicant, David Gregory MacDonald, seeks leave to appeal from a sentence imposed upon him in the District Court of New South Wales on 23 March 2006. The notice of application for leave to appeal is dated 19 December 2006. 
     
      
    4 The applicant pleaded guilty on 30 January 2006 to one count of attempted robbery armed with an offensive weapon: s.97(1) (“armed with offensive weapon, or instrument, or being in company with another person …”) and s.344A (“attempts”) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). The maximum penalty for such an offence is 20 years imprisonment. 
     
      
    5 The offence in question occurred on 30 May 2000. 
     
      
    6 The court, when sentencing the applicant, took into account on a Form 1, an offence of being armed with intent to commit an indictable offence. That offence is said to have occurred on 5 June 2000. 
     
      
    7 On 23 March 2006, his Honour, Acting Judge Mahoney, QC., imposed a term of imprisonment of five years, to commence 23 March 2006 and to expire 22 March 2011 with a non-parole period of two years to expire on 22 March 2008. 
     
      
    8 The application for leave to appeal was founded on four grounds as follows:- 
     
      
       
      (a) His Honour erred in failing to take into account as a mitigating factor the applicant’s mental disorder at the time of the commission of the offence. 
       
       
      (b) His Honour was in error in not moderating the sentence as a result of lengthy and unexplained delay on the part of prosecuting authorities. 
       
       
      (c) His Honour erred by finding that he was bound to apply the guideline judgment of  
      Regina v. Henry  
      (1999) 46 NSWLR 346. 
       
       
      (d) The sentence is manifestly excessive. 
       
       
      Agreed facts on sentence 
       
      
    9 The agreed facts on sentence were set out in a document which I reproduce below:- 
     
      
       
        
        “At about 7.30 pm on Tuesday 30th of May 2000, Paul Pessotto was working behind the counter of Slicker Liquor at the corner of Elizabeth Drive and Monash Place, Bonnyrigg. Pessotto noticed the accused enter the store holding two syringes, one in each hand. Pessotto noticed that the syringes were each filled with a red coloured liquid consistent with blood. The accused was holding both syringes on either side of his waist and stomach pointing towards Pessotto. Pessotto said, ’What do you want?’. The accused said, ‘Open the till’. Pessotto delayed in opening the till and the accused said again, ‘Open the till’. Pessotto opened the till and stepped backwards. The accused then stepped forward. He placed both syringes in his left hand and reached inside with his right hand. As he did this, Mr Pessotto grabbed a wooden baseball bat from under the counter and hit the accused on his left shoulder. The accused then ran from the store empty handed. Pessotto gave chase and saw the accused run along Monash Place. Pessotto returned to the store and saw there was a red substance on a fifty dollar note that had been dropped on the counter. Police attended the premises and took possession of the $50 note for the purposes of a DNA analysis. 
        
       
       
        
        Some six days later at about 10.30 am on Monday the 5th of June 2000, Mr Pessotto was again working at the counter of Slicker Liquor at Bonnyrigg. Pessotto saw the accused enter the store. Pessotto noticed that the accused was holding a syringe in his left hand and that the syringe contained a red coloured liquid consistent with blood. Pessotto picked up his wooden baseball bat and the accused saw the bat and ran from the premises. Again Mr. Pessotto gave chase and saw the accused run down Monash Place. 
        
       
       
        
        On 23 June 2000, the stained $50 note was conveyed to the DAL. On 10 July 2001, a buccal swab was taken from the accused whilst an inmate at the John Maroney Correctional Centre (on an unrelated matter) pursuant to Part 7 of the Crimes (Forensic Procedures) Act 2000. The sample was then forwarded to the DAL. On 6 April 2004, a certificate was prepared by David Bruce, Analyst, of the DAL. Bruce found the accused had the same DNA profile as the DNA recovered from the stained area of the $50 note. This profile was expected to occur in fewer that 1 in 10 billion individuals in the general population. 
        
       
       
        
        The accused at this time was no longer in custody and was circulated as a suspect in relation to the above offences. On 31 January 2005, the accused was arrested in relation to this matter. When the accused was asked about this matter by police, the accused said, ‘I can’t remember much about back then because I was on drugs heavily’. A forensic procedure was conducted by consent on the accused by way of a buccal swab on 31 January 2005. This swab was delivered to the DAL on 10 February 2005. In a certificate dated 6 May 2005, David Bruce confirmed that the accused’s DNA retrieved from the buccal swab had the same DNA profile as the DNA recovered from the stained area of the $50 note. Again, Bruce confirmed that this profile is expected to occur in fewer than 1 in 10 billion individuals in the general population.” 
        
       
      
    10 Acting Judge Mahoney correctly emphasised that the offence in the indictment and that on the Form 1 were both very serious offences and he observed that (remarks on sentence, p.4):- 
     
      
       
        
        “The courts must make clear to the whole community that this conduct is not likely (sic, ‘lightly’) to be tolerated and will be severely punished.” 
        
       
      
    11 Amongst the several issues for consideration on the application for leave to appeal the following matters are central to the determination: 
     
      
       
      (a) The objective criminality of the offences and the application of the  
      Henry 
       guideline judgment. 
       
       
      (b) The applicant’s ill-health (in particular, his mental health) and the implication for sentence arising from the same. 
       
       
      (c) The delay between the date of the offence and the sentence. 
       
      
    12 The applicant was 23 years of age at the date of the offences (date of birth, 7 August 1976). He is of Aboriginal descent. He is the eldest of three children and was educated at Meadowbank and Cessnock Public Schools. He left half way through Year 11. He commenced the use of drugs at the age of 15 (heroin). His drug use escalated and he was a heroin user as at the dates of the offences. He commenced a de facto relationship with his ex-partner in 1994 and had three children from the relationship which ended in 2003. 
     
      
    13 In the Pre-Sentence Report (p.2) it is said that he last held employment some nine years before the date of that report. 
     
      
       
      Health issues 
       
      
    14 The applicant suffered endocarditis in July 2000 resulting in a leaking heart valve and some form of organic brain damage leading to epilepsy. 
     
      
    15 In the Pre-Sentence Report (p.2), the following appears:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Mr MacDonald appears to assume little responsibility for his own day to day affairs with control of these matters being invested to his mother. Daily contact with his children endows the offender with some emotional stability. However, it is apparent that this emotional and physical support is insufficient motivation to address ongoing drug dependency.” 
        
       
      
    16 In a report made by Mr. Peter Champion, Consulting Clinical Psychologist, dated 16 February 2006 (p.6), it is stated that the applicant claimed to have been drug free for some four to five years. There is, however, conflicting evidence on this point. There were no obvious indications, according to Mr. Champion, that the applicant was “unfit” on the basis of intellectual capacity or mental illness. 
     
      
    17 A medical report from Dr. David Taylor dated 22 March 2006 was tendered at the sentencing hearing. Dr. Taylor is a cardiologist and he confirmed the diagnosis of cardiac bacterial endocarditis. The applicant had a lesion on the mitral valve of the heart. He underwent cardiac surgery for mitral valve repair on 13 July 2000. He was discharged on 17 August 2000. 
     
      
    18 Subsequent seizures were diagnosed as epilepsy. Dr. Taylor noted that epilepsy had been difficult to control and that the applicant had significant cerebral damage. Its precise nature is not identified. The epilepsy was related to the cerebral micro-embolic and abscess due to his endocarditis. Trauma to the skin would expose the applicant to further risk of infection of the mitral valve and, accordingly, this limited the available fields of employment that were open to him. 
     
      
       
      Other offences 
       
      
    19 On 11 May 2001, the applicant was sentenced to one count of use offensive weapon to prevent lawful detention. He was sentenced to imprisonment for 15 months with a non-parole period of eight months to commence on 11 May 2001. He received a concurrent sentence of eight months on one count of drive conveyance taken without consent of the owner. 
     
      
    20 The applicant was released on 18 January 2002. 
     
      
       
      Grounds of the appeal 
       
       
      (a) Ground 1 - His Honour erred in failing to take into account as a mitigating factor the applicant’s mental disorder at the time of the commission of the offence 
       
      
    21 There are two factual matters that are relevant to the applicant’s mental condition. The first is the nature of the condition and the second is the timing of its onset. 
     
      
    22 The applicant came under the care of Dr. Taylor when hospitalised between 25 June 2000 and 17 August 2000, that is, 26 days after he committed the relevant offence. Dr. Taylor concluded:- 
     
      
       
        
        “… it was likely that (the applicant’s) illness preceded admission to hospital (25 June 2000) by up to two weeks. In that time, he would likely have had intermittent high temperatures and altered behaviour.” 
        
       
      
    23 There is no evidence that establishes that the applicant suffered a physical or mental disorder at the time of committing the relevant offence on 30 May 2000. This, however, is a point of contention in these proceedings. In the written submissions for the applicant, it is said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “37. His Honour accepted that the infection of the brain and associated confusion and mental disarray resulted in a mental disorder such that his Honour found he had been affected at the time of the commission of the offences to the extent that his capacity to plan had been gravely compromised. It is submitted that as a corollary, his judgment had been similarly compromised by his illness.” 
        
       
      
    24 In the respondent’s written submissions, however, it is stated:- 
     
      
       
        
        “11. The applicant’s written submissions … at 36-37 put that his Honour accepted that the infection of the brain resulted in the applicant’s planning capacity being gravely compromised and that it follows that his judgment was similarly compromised. The respondent submits that while his Honour found at ROS 13.4 that the circumstances within which the indictment and Form 1 offences were committed evidenced severely compromised planning capacity, his Honour did not say that the planning capacity was compromised as a result of a brain infection. To have so found would have been inconsistent with the evidence.” 
        
       
      
    25 On the evidence before the sentencing judge, the respondent’s last-mentioned submission on the point is correct and should be accepted. That conclusion leads to the further point that reliance upon the line of case law that has considered the relevance of mental disorder in the sentencing process (including Regina v. Engert (1995) 84 A. Crim. R. 67, 71 per Gleeson, CJ. and Regina v. Israil [2002] NSWCCA 225 at [22] and other cases referred to in the written submissions for the applicant at [38]) has limited application in the present case. 
     
      
    26 As Grove J in Regina v. Hemsley [2004] NSWCCA 228 observed, mental illness may be relevant in a number of ways: [33] to [36]. Some of the considerations there referred to may, Janus-like, face in opposite directions – one or more may favour moderation in sentence, whilst another consideration may call for special deterrence, as where an offender presents a level of danger to the community. 
     
      
    27 The sentencing judge was entitled to have some regard for the fact that the applicant in this case could pose a danger to the community unless his drug problem is controlled and hopefully removed by appropriate measures. 
     
      
    28 The learned sentencing judge did, in my opinion, bring into account the applicant’s mental and physical health in a way that was quite appropriate. He firstly determined that a sentence less than full-time custody was inappropriate but his Honour did make a finding of special circumstances with the result that the applicant’s non-parole period was determined at 40% of the total term of imprisonment. There was, in my opinion, no warrant for further applying the applicant’s health to reduce the sentence that was otherwise determined to be appropriate. 
     
      
    29 I consider that the issue involving the applicant’s mental health was properly considered in the overall context of this case, which included the applicant’s drug problem. 
     
      
    30 Accordingly, the submission made on behalf of the applicant that general deterrence ought to have played a lesser role in the sentencing exercise and therefore the sentence should have been moderated, must be rejected. 
     
      
       
      (b) Ground 2 - His Honour was in error in not moderating the sentence as a result of lengthy and unexplained delay on the part of prosecuting authorities 
       
      
    31 The applicant relies upon the delay of two years and nine months for a DNA certificate to be issued. He was in custody from 11 May 2001 until 10 January 2002. It was submitted (written submissions, [41]):- 
     
      
       
        
        “With due diligence, the applicant could and should have been charged with the current offences prior to his release from that custody.” 
        
       
      
    32 The sentencing judge observed (remarks on sentence, p.12) that it was no surprise that the offender claimed under oath to have no recollection of having committed either of the two offences. He accepted the truthfulness of the applicant’s claim not to be able to remember either offence and on the question of delay stated (remarks on sentence, p.15):- 
     
      
       
        
        “But in this case, as the Crown submitted, if he cannot remember having committed the offence, there would not have been too much suspense or uncertainty about the matter. The Crown does not contest the facts sworn to by the offender that at the time of the taking of the buccal swab on 10 July 2001 he asked the authorities at that time to … wipe the slate clean for him for anything else that he might have committed that he was unable to remember. By way of general confession, at least, he must have felt better in his mind, but there was nothing that he was able to remember and he still cannot remember these two offences, so that the delay would not have been of any particular significance, in my view, in this case, except until he was arrested on 31 January, and since then it does not seem to me that there has been an inordinate amount of delay for which the Crown or the Director of Public Prosecution should be held in any way responsible.” 
        
       
      
    33 The sentencing judge later concluded (remarks on sentence, p.17):- 
     
      
       
        
        “It seems to me that although there has been a delay of several years in this case, it is not the sort of delay which has weighed heavily or at all, on the mind of this offender until such time as he was charged on 31 January last year. Accordingly, it could not be said that he faces any unfairness by standing for sentence today and being sentenced.” 
        
       
      
    34 Counsel for the applicant relied upon the well known principle in Regina v. Todd (1982) 2 NSWLR 517 at 519 on the question of delay. Reference in this respect was also made to the judgment in Mill v. Regina (1988) 166 CLR 59 at 64. 
     
      
    35 Reliance was also placed upon the decision of this Court in Regina v. Johnson (unreported 16 May 1997 at p.7) which emphasised that delay on occasions may mitigate the sentence to be imposed upon an offender where the time between the commission of the offence and the sentence is sufficient to enable a court to see that the offender has become rehabilitated, or that the rehabilitation process has made good progress. 
     
      
    36 The Crown referred to the recent decision of this Court on the question of delay in Regina v. Hathaway [2005] NSWCCA 368 in which case the Chief Justice agreed with the observations of McClellan CJ at CL at [41] to [43]. Reference was also made to the judgment of James J in Regina v. Shorten [2005] NSWCCA 106 at [19]. 
     
      
    37 The Crown has relied upon the fact that there was no relevant delay from the time of arrest as the applicant was committed for trial less than six months after his arrest. 
     
      
    38 In relation to the alternative way in which delay may be relevant, the Crown emphasised that the sentencing judge specifically addressed the issue of the applicant’s rehabilitation, noting that he continued his drug use after being hospitalised and effectively until sentence. This tended to show a lack of progress in terms of rehabilitation. He committed further, although minor, offences following release from hospital and he was sentenced to a relative short term of imprisonment thereafter. 
     
      
    39 The third way in which delay is said to have been relevant was that if there had not been the delay in question and the applicant had been sentenced during the currency of his non-parole period for the 1999 offence, “he would in all likelihood have received a cumulative sentence for the offence of attempted armed robbery” (applicant’s written submissions, [53]). 
     
      
    40 As the Crown observed, whether or not a cumulative sentence would have been imposed if the applicant had been sentenced during his non-parole period for the 1999 offences is speculative. The structuring of sentences for multiple offences is an aspect of sentencing that does call for the exercise of discretion. Whether that discretion would have been or may have been exercised in a way that favoured the applicant is a speculative question and I do not consider that principle would indicate that his Honour erred in the approach taken by him on question of delay. In other words, I consider the approach taken by the sentencing judge on this aspect was entirely correct. 
     
      
       
      (c) Ground 3 - His Honour erred by finding that he was bound to apply the guideline judgment of  
      Regina v. Henry  
      (1999) 46 NSWLR 346 
       
      
    41 It was submitted on behalf of the applicant that, given that the offence itself was an attempted armed robbery as well as what are described as “the unusual circumstances which existed in both the delay … and the applicant’s very serious health condition”, there existed reasons to depart from the guideline judgment. 
     
      
    42 The sentencing judge specifically adverted to the fact that the guideline judgment did have application to attempted crimes against the person and property. 
     
      
    43 I do not consider that the learned sentencing judge erred in turning to the decision in Henry for general guidance and it has not been demonstrated that his Honour erred in the way in which he understood and applied the general guidance to be derived from that judgment. 
     
      
       
      (d) Ground 4 - The sentence is manifestly excessive 
       
      
    44 It was submitted that, having applied the guideline judgment in Henry, the sentencing judge erred in commencing with a starting point of six years. It was submitted that the starting point of six years was manifestly excessive and that, accordingly, the overall sentence imposed was outside the sentencing judge’s reasonable sentencing discretion. 
     
      
    45 In determining the sentence in the present case, a starting point of six years was taken which was then discounted by 16 to 17% to arrive at a total term of five years. The starting point, it was submitted, was too high.  
     
      
    46 The Crown correctly refers to the recent judgment in SZ v. Regina  [2007] NSWCCA 19 wherein Buddin J (with whom Simpson and Howie JJ agreed) noted at [40]:- 
     
      
       
        
        “In assessing the contention that the sentences imposed were manifestly excessive, it is important to focus upon the sentences actually imposed rather than upon the starting point or notional sentence.” 
        
       
      
    47 In determining how the guideline should be applied, the sentencing judge was entitled to take into account that the applicant was not the comparatively young offender referred to in the guideline judgment, that he did have a criminal history and I accept the Crown’s submission that his choice of weapon (two blood-filled syringes) in respect of the relevant offence that occurred on 30 May 2000 was of particular significance. 
     
      
    48 I do not consider that the sentencing judge’s discretion is shown to have miscarried and no error of principle in my opinion has been demonstrated. I accept the submission made in the Crown’s written submissions in paragraph 35, which I reproduce:- 
     
      
       
        
        “35. In the respondent’s submission, the sentence is not manifestly excessive due to the following:- 
        
       
       
        
          
        • the maximum penalty for the offence is imprisonment for 20 years. 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          • In relation to the Form 1 offence, this was required to be taken into account by his Honour with a view to increasing the relevant sentence:  
          Attorney General’s Application under s.37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 No 1 of 2002 
           (2002) 137 A Crim R 180. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          •  
          The applicant had an involvement in stealing and related offences dating back to 1995. He had previously received a sentence of incarceration for offences of Drive Conveyance Without Consent and Use Offensive Weapon to Avoid Lawful Apprehension. The applicant’s criminal history, whilst not as extensive as some, disentitles him to any leniency and indicates that it is more appropriate to give more weight to factors such as retribution and general and specific deterrence. This is especially so as the applicant was on a bond at the time of his offending. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          •  
          The applicant’s weapon of choice was two blood-filled syringes. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          • Comparatively, the applicant was not young when he committed the offences. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          • General deterrence is of significant importance in relation to this offence; any sentence must be seen as a strong deterrent to those who may be tempted to engage in similar offences. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          • His Honour gave the applicant a generous discount for his guilty plea. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          •  
          His Honour discussed the applicant’s subjective features at ROS 6-13 and took them into account, including his expressions of contrition. His Honour also took into account the applicant’s special circumstances and the need for his supervision on release.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    49 I, accordingly, propose that:- 
     
      
       
      (a) the applicant be granted leave to appeal; 
       
       
      (b) the appeal be dismissed.

    JUDGMENT1. Mr Simpson submits that I should refuse to admit evidence of the polling booth demonstration which was in the form of statements and photographic evidence. His submission was based upon s135 and s137 of the Evidence Act 1995. Essentially the arguments in support of both applications was the same. 2. Mr Simpson argued that the probative value of the evidence was not particularly high. He argued that his client may or may not be a protester. However, it seems to me that in light of the evidence of Musadek Al Zargani in exhibit VDEM 16 that it is clear that Mr El Mostafa had views about the election which were contrary to those partaking in the voting procedure. 3. I therefore agree with the crown that the probative value of this evidence is high, particularly given the Crown case that the riot was the result of the combination of three factors, one of which was the political element of the voting in the Iraqi elections. Mr Al Mostafa's presence at the voting in the elections, as demonstrated in the photographs, provides him with a motive to be in the riot and therefore makes more explicable his alleged participation in the riot. I should add when I use the phrase ""as demonstrated in the photographs"" that in my view it is open to a jury to conclude that the photographs depict Mr El Mostafa. 4. The question of whether the evidence presents a danger of unfair prejudice under either of the sections is another issue. Mr Simpson's submission is that the jury may draw an inference that he was a protester and had a motive to be in the riot. However, in my opinion, this is not an unfair prejudice as McHugh J said in Papakosmas v The Queen (1999) 196 CLA 297 at 325 ([91]):  
     
      
       
       “Evidence is not unfairly prejudicial merely because it makes it more likely that the defendant will be convicted. In  
       R v BD 
        (1997) 94 ACrimR 131 at 139 Hunt CJ at CL pointed out:  
       
       
        
         
         'The prejudice to which each of the sections [s135, s136 and s137] refers is  
         not 
          that the evidence merely tends to establish the crown case; it means prejudice which is unfair because there is a real risk that the evidence will be misused by the jury in some unfair way.'“ 
         
        
       
       
       The fact that the evidence provides a motive for his client's involvement in the alleged offence as submitted by Mr Simpson is not, in my opinion, an unfair prejudice in this case. 
       
      
    5. But Mr Simpson said another basis was the election issues which apparently motivated the protestors touched upon the Iraqi war and hence juries may have strong views for or against some of the issues. That fact may have the potential to deflect jurors from their task. 6. I can appreciate the force of this argument. It is just the kind of potential prejudice that may act unfairly on an accused. However, whether or not it is unfairly prejudicial in a particular case must be seen, in my opinion, in the complex issues in this trial. The crown case will evidently be in the context of religious and political disharmony amongst the Iraqi community in Sydney. It will be part of its case that this disharmony explains what was going on. It seems to me therefore that it will be inevitable that the issues may drift close to controversial public topics. 7. This result would be, in my opinion, not unfairly prejudiced to the accused because it will be a necessary consequence of the issues in the trial. But it will be important that I warn the jury of the need to avoid taking into account any of their personal views about issues which may arise in the trial. 8. In my opinion the probative value of the proposed evidence is not substantially outweighed by any danger suggested in s 135 of the Evidence Act, nor is the probative value outweighed by the danger of any unfair prejudice in accordance with s 137 of the Evidence Act and I therefore refuse the application.

    JUDGMENT1. This is a case in which part of the evidence against the accused Mr El Mostafa involves evidence from witnesses who have purported to identify him from photographs shown to them by police officers. Mr Simpson, on behalf of his client, seeks a ruling that that process of identification is not admissible pursuant to s 115(5) of the Evidence Act 1995. Section 115(1) provides: 
     
      
       
       “In this section: 'picture identification evidence' means identification evidence relating to an identification made wholly or partly by the person who made the identification examining pictures kept for the use of police officers.” 
       
      
    2. The section then goes on to specify various circumstances in which such picture identification is not admissible. This case is clearly a case in which, so far as this process of identification is concerned, the process amounted to picture identification evidence. Mr Simpson's reliance, as I have said, is upon subs (5) which provides as follows: 
     
      
       
       “Picture identification evidence adduced by the prosecutor is not admissible if, when the pictures were examined, the defendant was in the custody of a police officer of the police force investigating the commission of the offence with which the defendant has been charged, unless:  
        
        
       (a) the defendant refused to take part in an identification parade; or 
        
        
       (b) the defendant's appearance had changed significantly between the time when the offence was committed and the time when the defendant was taken into custody; or 
        
        
       (c) it would not have been reasonable to have held an identification parade that included the defendant.” 
       
      
    3. Mr Simpson frankly acknowledged - and correctly in my opinion - that his application depended upon satisfying me that his client was ""in the custody of a police officer of the police force investigating the commission of the offence"" at the relevant time. It is common ground that at the time the picture identification evidence was obtained in this case, Mr El Mostafa was in the custody of the Department of Corrective Services or whatever the relevant authority managing corrective centres is. 4. I am not satisfied that Mr El Mostafa was in the custody of a police officer of the police force investigating the commission of the offence at the relevant time. I hold that opinion for these reasons: First, I note from the dictionary to the Evidence Act that for the purposes of the New South Wales Act ""a police officer"" relevantly means a member of the police force of this state. Hence it is clear that the custody in which, so far as the definition of ""police officer"" is concerned, a defendant must be held, is that of a police officer of this state. 5. Secondly, in my opinion the fact that Mr El Mostafa was in the custody of Corrective Services authorities must exclude him from being in the custody of a police officer of the police force investigating the commission of the offence. There is no way in which it can be said that the Department of Corrective Services was charged with investigating the commission of the offence in this question. That is clearly the province of the police force. To my mind the wording of the subsection by reference to ""a police officer"", by further reference to ""a police force"" and by additional reference to ""force investigating the commission of the offence"" leaves no doubt that a person in the custody of prison authorities could not fall within that provision. 6. I am reinforced in my view by a judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Regina v McKellar [2000] NSWCCA 532. Although that case did not concern the issue which I have to determine, Howie J in delivering the judgment of the court in that case said at [34] that it seemed plain to him that the normal meaning should be applied to the words ""in the custody of a police officer"". I appreciate that his Honour was referring to the nature of the custody, rather than the nature of the authorities who held the prisoner in custody in that case.7. However, Mr Simpson has also drawn my attention to a judgment of Bell J of the Supreme Court in  Regina v Darwiche & Ors [2006] NSWSC 942. In that case it appears that the issue before me was raised because the prisoner in that case was in custody at a correctional centre. At [33] her Honour said: 
     
      
       
       “ 
       The plain words of s 115(5) do not seem to me to admit of the construction for which Mr Segal contended. On 1 April 2004 the accused was in custody, but he was not in the custody of a police officer of the police force investigating the commission of the offence with which he has been charged 
       .” 
       
      
     I record my appreciation for Mr Simpson drawing my attention, entirely appropriately, to that decision which as I said reinforces my own opinion. 8. Accordingly, in my opinion s 115 of the Evidence Act does not render inadmissible the picture identification evidence sought to be led by the Crown in this case.

      JUDGMENT 
       
      
      
      HER HONOUR 
      :  
       
      
    1 At the close of the Crown case Mr Byrne SC sought a directed verdict in respect of the first count on the indictment. That count charges that: 
     
      
       
        
        On or about 30 January 2003 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales, knowing that Pan Pharmaceuticals Limited’s computer data for the testing of a travel sickness medication known as Travacalm may be required in evidence in a judicial proceeding, did procure the conduct of another person, namely Karl Brooks, to intentionally destroy or render said data illegible or undecipherable or incapable of identification with intent thereby to prevent it from being used in evidence. 
         
         
        Particulars 
         
        The computer data was the data on the Pan Pharmaceuticals Limited’s HPLC computer which contained the said Travacalm data. 
        
       
      
    2 Before developing that submission Mr Byrne also asked that the second count on the indictment be withdrawn from the jury. The second count charges an attempt to commit the offence charged in the first count. It is cast in the alternative. In terms, the second count charges that: 
     
      
       
        
        On or about 30 January 2003 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales, knowing that Pan Pharmaceuticals Limited’s computer data for the testing of a travel sickness medication known as Travacalm may be required in evidence in a judicial proceeding, did procure the conduct of another person, namely Karl Brooks,  
        to attempt 
         to intentionally destroy or render said data illegible or undecipherable or incapable of identification with intent thereby to prevent it from being used in evidence. 
         
         
        Particulars 
         
        The computer data was the data on the Pan Pharmaceuticals Limited’s HPLC computer which contained the said Travacalm data. 
        
       
      
    3 Both counts are charged by reference to s 39 of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) as the offence creating provision. It provides that: 
     
      
       
        
        Any person who, knowing that any book, document, or other thing of any kind, is or may be required in evidence in a judicial proceeding, intentionally destroys it or renders it illegible or undecipherable or incapable of identification, with intent thereby to prevent it from being used in evidence, shall be guilty of an offence. 
         
        
       
      
    4 Relevant provisions of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth) provide the structure within which the constituent elements of an offence against s 39 must be construed. Argument has focused on particular provisions in Chapter 2 of the Criminal Code (Cth) to which I will later refer. The Crown also relies upon the provisions relating to “innocent agency” as provided for in s 11.3 Criminal Code (Cth), although no issue arises as to the operation of this provision on this application.  
     
      
    5 The withdrawal of the second count from the jury was a matter that had been adverted to as a possibility in discussions I initiated with counsel once it became evident that the opinion evidence the Crown proposed to lead from Mr Bussing, an expert in the retrieval and recovery of computer data, would be different in material respects from the conclusions expressed in his statement of October 2006 (served as part of the brief of evidence). The reasons for and the extent of the change in the evidence the Crown proposed to lead from Mr Bussing have been canvassed by me in a judgment already published in the proceedings and I do not repeat my findings (see R v Selim [2007] NSWSC 322).  
     
      
    6 For the purposes of the application to withdraw the second count from the jury, it is clear that it was those parts of the October 2006 statement that Mr Bussing has since abandoned that Mr Robberds QC referred to in his opening remarks to the jury when explaining to them the basis for the attempt count being included on the indictment. 
     
      
    7 In his opening Mr Robberds QC submitted: 
     
      
       
        
        Now, the fact that there is some data still on that computer brings me to the second alternative count in the indictment. The principal Crown case is that Mr Brooks, acting on the instructions of the accused, activated the Seagate Disk Wizard programme and effectively destroyed or rendered the Travacalm data on the computer illegible.  
         
         
        Insofar as that low level format was not fully successful and there remains on the hard drive some data which is not retrievable in its original format, that would result, on one view of the facts, of an offence of attempting to intentionally render the data illegible rather than the offence of in fact rendering the data eligible. That is the reason while the alternative count is included in the indictment. (T-21.39-53) 
        
       
      
    8 At the close of the Crown case on Thursday 12th April 2007, I ruled that there was no evidence (or no sufficient evidence) upon which the alternate count of attempt could be left to the jury given that Mr Bussing was no longer of the opinion that a low level format may have been unsuccessfully attempted. In these circumstances, I indicated that I would withdraw the second count from the jury before closing submissions from the Crown commenced.  
     
      
    9 I turn now to consider whether a verdict of acquittal should be directed on the first count. Despite the fact that there is an overlap between the constituent elements of both counts on the indictment, I emphasise that the second count was withdrawn from the jury’s consideration for reasons independent of any analysis of those shared constituent elements although, it must be said, that in light of the decision that I have made in respect of the first count on the indictment, the second count would fail for the same reasons.  
     
      
    10 There are a number of grounds upon which I am asked to direct a verdict on the first count on the indictment. I have received detailed submissions both orally and in writing in respect of each of the various grounds. There is no need for me to refer at length to each ground as I am satisfied that what I am content to describe as the primary or fundamental ground has been made out. 11 The primary basis advanced by Mr Byrne for a directed verdict is that, on a proper construction of the constituent fault and physical elements of the offence created by s 39 of the Crimes Act (Cth), there is a no evidence of an essential component of the circumstance to which the fault element of knowledge must relate. The Crown concedes that, were the construction of s 39 as contended for by the accused correct, a directed verdict must be the result. I should note that this issue (although perhaps not quite the way the argument has crystallised) has been latent in the trial from the outset, in that neither the Crown nor the accused opened to the jury on the fault element in respect of either of counts one or two on the indictment, informing the jury that that was a matter upon which they would be directed at the conclusion of the evidence. I am informed by counsel that the precise way in which the argument is put here was not advanced in earlier trial proceedings in respect of the same indictment, and I am satisfied that it was not the subject of the decision in this Court where leave was sought under s 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, Selim v Regina [2006] NSWCCA 378. I am also informed that there is no guidance from other courts in the Commonwealth and, moreover, that there has been no prosecution of any person under this section of which those instructing the Crown are aware. 
     
      
    12 By operation of s.2.1 of the Criminal Code (Cth) the construction that must be given to the constituent elements of an offence under s 39 of the Crimes Act (Cth) is that which is provided for in ss 3.1 and 3.2 of the Criminal Code (Cth): 
     
      
       
        
        3.1  
        Elements 
         
         (1) An offence consists of physical elements and fault elements. 
         
         (2) However, the law that creates the offence may provide that there is no fault element for one or more physical elements. 
         
         (3) The law that creates the offence may provide different fault elements for different physical elements. 
         
        3.2  
        Establishing guilt in respect of offences 
         
        In order for a person to be found guilty of committing an offence the following must be proved: 
         
         (a) the existence of such physical elements as are, under the law creating the offence, relevant to establishing guilt; 
         
         (b) in respect of each such physical element for which a fault element is required, one of the fault elements for the physical element. 
        
       
      
    13 Once the relevant physical and fault elements are identified (noting that s 3.1(3) provides that there may be more than one physical and fault element in the offence, as is the case here) s 3.2 provides that in order for guilt to be established the physical element or elements need to be proved and, in respect of each such physical element for which a fault element is required, proof of one of the fault elements must also be established. Sections 13.1 and 13.2 impose on the prosecution the legal burden of proving every element of an offence relevant to the guilt of the person charged and to the criminal standard of proof. 
     
      
    14 Sections 6.1(2) and 6.2(2) of the Criminal Code (Cth) make provision for strict or absolute liability to apply to a particular physical element of a particular offence and s 3.1(2) recognises that the law creating the offence may provide for no fault element for one or more physical element. Self evidently, the Parliament made no provision in s 39 for any of the constituent physical elements to be the subject of the application of either strict or absolute liability. Neither has it provided for a no fault element in respect of any physical element. Accordingly, the section must be construed in the way provided for in s 3.2 of the Criminal Code (Cth).15 In the process of amending various sections within Part III of the Crimes Act (Cth) to ensure conformity with the principles of criminal responsibility as expressed in the Criminal Code (Cth) (including an amendment to s 39), the Parliament made express provision for the physical element in particular sections of that Part to have strict or absolute liability applied to them (see sections 42 and 43 where absolute liability applies to the physical element of a circumstance of the offence, namely that the judicial power in relation to which the course of justice is affected is the judicial power of the Commonwealth). I also note that the Explanatory Memorandum in respect of the Law and Justice Amendment (Application of Criminal Code) Bill 2000 (Cth) states in respect of the then proposed amendment to s 42: 
     
      
       
        
        248. This physical element is an appropriate candidate for the application of absolute liability because in most applicable instances the person concerned will not possess any fault element concerning this physical element, and accordingly the offence would become almost unenforceable if the prosecution were obliged to demonstrate fault. Further, the person’s degree of culpability under this offence is not materially affected by absence of the subject fault. The defence of mistake of fact should not be available to the defendant and accordingly absolute liability, and not strict liability, is the appropriate application…. 
        
       
      
    16 It is against this background that identification of the constituent elements of the first count of the indictment must be undertaken.  
     
      
    17 The first step involves a characterisation or identification of the physical and fault elements relevant to establishing guilt of the offence charged. The parties are agreed that the relevant fault elements are knowledge and intention. I have not invited submissions, and none have been advanced as to the significance of the fact that the fault element of intention relates to the physical element of destroying the data to prevent it being used in evidence. This is in recognition of the fact that there is no deficiency in the evidence in respect of these elements, given the content of the evidence of Mr Brooks as the person procured by the accused to destroy the data and the provisions of s 11.3 of the Criminal Code (Cth).  
     
      
    18 In so far as identifying which of the physical elements in s 4.1 of the Criminal Code (Cth) is the one to which the accused’s knowledge must relate in a charge under s 39, the parties are agreed that it is that which is provided for in s 4.1(1)(c), namely ‘a circumstance in which conduct or a result of conduct occurs’ as distinct from conduct or a result of conduct itself. Section 5.3 of the Code provides that a person has knowledge of a circumstance if he or she is aware that it exists or will exist in the ordinary course of things.  
     
      
    19 While the parties are agreed on the way the Criminal Code (Cth) operates to identify and define the constituent elements of an offence against s.39 of the Crimes Act (Cth), they identify or characterise the particular circumstance to which the accused’s knowledge must relate in different ways. It is the resolution of this dispute that determines the outcome of the application for a directed verdict on the first count. 
     
      
    20 The following words, italicised for emphasis, are crucial to the debate:  
     
      
       
        
        On or about 30 January 2003 (the accused)  
        knowing that 
         Pan Pharmaceuticals Limited’s  
        computer data 
          
        for the testing of a travel sickness medication known as Travacalm  
        may be required  
        in evidence in a judicial proceeding 
        …….  
        
       
      
    21 Section 31 of the Crimes Act (Cth) provides that in this Part, unless the contrary intention appears: 
     
      
       
        
        judicial proceeding 
          
        means a proceeding in or before a federal court, court exercising federal jurisdiction or court of a Territory, and includes a proceeding before a body or person acting under the law of the Commonwealth, or of a Territory, in which evidence may be taken on oath. 
         
        
       
      
    22 The Crown submits that, to prove that the accused knew that the computer data may be required in evidence in a judicial proceeding, it is sufficient that he was aware that it was a reasonable possibility that proceedings would be brought in a Court, and that the data may be required as evidence in those proceedings, but that it need not prove that the accused knew that that the proceeding in which the data might be required was a judicial proceeding as defined, in effect, a Federal judicial proceeding. So ever long as there were, at the date the offence is alleged to have been committed, identifiable potential judicial proceedings wherein the data may have been be required as evidence, and that the accused was aware of the facts that would in fact support a cause of action in those judicial proceedings when he procured Mr Brooks to destroy the data, that, according to the Crown, is sufficient for the matter to be left to the jury. 
     
      
    23 In a written submission Mr Robberds QC expressed it as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        If the accused  
        knew 
         that: 
         
        the data may be required in evidence (i) in litigation (ii) where the consumers sued Pan (iii) for injuries suffered because of a defect in the Travacalm tablets (iv) manufactured by Pan (v) (i.e. the accused knew each of those 5 facts) 
         
        then he  
        knew 
         that the data may be required in evidence in a judicial proceeding as defined in section 31 of the Crimes Act. 
         
        And the reason he  
        knew 
         that fact is because that litigation is a proceeding based on section 75 AD of the Trade Practices Act which is a proceeding that could be brought before a court exercising federal jurisdiction. (my underlining). 
         
         
        
       
      
    On this construction, proof that the potential proceedings were Federal proceedings is an objective fact and not part of the circumstance to which the fault element relates. On this construction, the Crown is, in effect, either imposing absolute liability to proof of the fact of the identification of the proceedings as part of the physical element in circumstances where the Parliament has not made provision for it, or it is applying a gloss to the construction of the section by reading the composite phrase ‘may be required in evidence in a judicial proceeding’ in such a way as to separate ‘judicial proceedings’ from the preceding part of the composite phrase.24 By contrast, the accused contends that on a proper construction of the section the Crown must prove that the accused knew that the data may be required in evidence in a Federal proceeding, that is the Crown must prove that the accused knew, in the sense that he was aware of the fact that the potential proceedings in which the data may be required as evidence were Federal judicial proceedings. 
     
      
    25 It is conceded by the Crown there is no evidence of this.26 As I have noted, there is no authority that compels a resolution of the issue. The question is essentially one of construction. R v Ensbey; ex parte A-G (Qld) [2004] QCA 335, the only authority to which I have been referred, is distinguishable. While the section of the Queensland Criminal Code under consideration in that case was in identical terms to s 39 of the Crimes Act, since it was a State offence it did not fall to be construed in the context of the constituent fault and physical elements that obtains where a Commonwealth offence is charged. Where knowledge as to a state of affairs might be taken to include a belief as to the existence of that state of affairs under the Queensland Code or at common law, this is not the position under the Code. The definition of knowledge in s 5.3 of the Criminal Code eschews belief and imposes a more exacting standard of conscious awareness. In addition, while the section of the Queensland Criminal Code concerned judicial proceedings, they were proceedings not defined in the restricted way provided for in s 31 of the Criminal Code. Since s 129 of the Queensland Criminal Code was a state offence, there was no need for the definition of judicial proceeding to be confined to the exercise of Federal legislative power. 27 In making application for a directed verdict Mr Byrne goes further than simply submitting that the Crown must prove that the accused knew that the relevant proceedings were judicial proceedings as defined. He also contends that such proceedings must have been either current or within the accused’s reasonable contemplation at the time that he gave the direction that the data be destroyed. That is, the judicial proceedings must as a matter of fact not only have been identifiable Federal judicial proceedings, but proceedings that had been initiated at the time that the instruction to destroy the data was given, or proceedings that were at least in the accused’s contemplation at that time, and not simply as a possibility but as a matter of reasonable certainty. It is submitted that unless there was evidence before the jury of this state of affairs (of which there is none) the Crown case must fail. 28 Mr Byrne draws support for this submission from the fact that the offence is found within Part III of the Crimes Act 1914 where the Parliament has provided for a range of offences concerned with the administration of justice. He contends that there can be no interference with the course of justice when there is nothing more than a possibility that judicial proceedings may take place at some indeterminate time in the future.29 This same submission was advanced in proceedings brought by the accused pursuant to the provisions of s 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 in respect of rulings made by Sorby DCJ when the matter was before his Honour for trial in the District Court in November 2006 and was rejected. In dealing with that argument McClellan CJ at CL said: 
     
      
       
        
        The applicant submitted that before the indictment could be made good and the prosecution succeed, the Crown must identify a particular judicial proceeding, which must be specified. In the alternative, it is submitted that before it will be adequately particularised, the Crown must identify a particular Federal proceeding in respect of which it is said that the applicant destroyed the relevant item, having the intent to prevent it from being used in evidence in those identified proceedings. 
        
       
       
        
        As presently advised, I do not accept that submission. It seems to me, that the section is directed at ensuring that relevant items are not destroyed or otherwise dealt with in the manner prohibited by the section at any time when the person effecting the relevant destruction or dealing  
        may reasonably have in contemplation 
         that a judicial proceeding may take place in the future, in which the items may be required in evidence. The section operates so that a person commits an offence if they effect the relevant destruction or other act at a time when there may be a reasonable possibility of judicial proceedings, although the particular proceedings may not at that time be capable of being identified. 
        
       
       
        
        If the section was to operate in the way the applicant suggested, it would have a very narrow effect. Indeed, it would operate to encourage the destruction of items at an early date being a point in time where a person may have in mind that judicial proceedings may take place, but because those proceedings have either not commenced or cannot, with particularity, be identified at that point in time, an offence is not committed. It would seem to me that this construction of this section is wholly inconsistent with the policy which lies behind it. ( 
        Selim v Regina 
         [2006] NSWCCA 378 at 7-8). 
         
        (emphasis added see para [27]) 
        
       
      
    30 I regard myself as bound by the decision of this Court in the 5F proceedings and, consistent with so holding, I am satisfied that the Crown does not have to establish that judicial proceedings were on foot or imminent in order for a case to be left to the jury. It is sufficient in the present case that the Crown establish that, at the time when the instruction to destroy the data was given by him, the accused was aware, in the sense that he had in reasonable contemplation, that there was a possibility of judicial proceedings being initiated in the future. 
    31 In the course of the argument before me Mr Byrne submitted that in that part of the judgment that I have underlined in the extract above, his Honour has misstated the requisite fault element of knowledge to something that approximates recklessness and that for that reason the decision is distinguishable, or that at least I should not regard myself as bound to follow it. I do not accept this submission. It is clear when regard is had to the paragraph that immediately follows that part of the judgment extracted, and the fact that the second ground of the application for leave expressly referred to it, that his Honour was mindful of the fact that knowledge was the requisite fault element to which the circumstance “may be required in a judicial proceeding” related. It is also clear that the Court was of the view that the question of how the accused’s knowledge that the data may be required in a judicial proceedings should be construed was premature as the learned trial judge had not at that time formulated his directions. I understand that the construction for which the Crown contends in the application before me was the way in which Sorby DCJ ultimately directed the jury, but that no point was taken in that trial that the construction was wrong or that there was an absence of evidence that the accused knew, in the way provided for in s 5.3 of the Criminal Code (Cth), that the proceedings were of the defined kind. 32 In persuading me to the view that the necessary relationship between the fault of knowledge and the physical element of the circumstance that the data may be required in evidence in a judicial proceeding is a strict one, such that the Crown must prove on the available evidence that the accused knew that the putative proceedings to which the Crown has referred were, in fact, proceedings of the defined kind, Mr Byrne referred to Beckwith v R (1976) 135 CLR 569 at 576 where Gibbs J said: 
     
      
       
        
        The rule formerly accepted, that statutes creating offences are to be strictly construed, has lost much of its importance in modern times. In determining the meaning of a penal statute the ordinary rules of construction must be applied, but if the language of the statute remains ambiguous or doubtful the ambiguity or doubt may be resolved in favour of the subject by refusing to extend the category of criminal offences: see  
        R v Adams 
         (12);  
        Craies on Statute Law 
        , 7th ed. (1971), pp. 529-534. The rule is perhaps one of last resort…. 
        
       
      
    33 In The Queen v Lavender (2005) 222 CLR 67 Kirby J at [88]-[95] made the following observations when considering whether the rule of strict interpretation was of assistance in construing s 18 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). At paragraph [93] his honour cites Beckwith as an authority for the principle that the rule is a one of last resort.  
     
      
       
        
        [88] In the past, including in this Court, it has been conventional to say that, where one has been left in real doubt as to the meaning of a penal provision, that provision will be construed strictly and in favour of the person potentially affected by the provision. This rule was originally conceived in the seventeenth century as a means of mitigating the harshness of penal legislation, breach of which often attracted the death penalty. Since that time, the rule has been transplanted and applied in various other legislative contexts, such as legislation purporting to impose taxation, or to interfere with the enjoyment of, or to take away rights to, private property.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        [89] The rule was conventionally justified on several grounds. First, it was suggested that because of the inequality between the resources of the state and accused persons, the rule played an important function in levelling the field of combat. In this sense, the rule was closely related to principles that are designed, among other things, to achieve an equilibrium between the state and accused persons, such as the presumption of innocence, the ""right to silence"", the requirement that the prosecution prove the elements of an offence to the criminal standard of proof and the common law requirement that jury verdicts be unanimous.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        [90] Secondly, it was sometimes asserted that the rule reflected the ideal that it is unfair to convict a person unless they have had fair warning of the reach of the criminal law concerned. This argument was explained by Holmes J delivering the opinion of the Court in  
        McBoyle v United States of America 
        . ""[I]t is reasonable that a fair warning should be given to the world ... of what the law intends to do if a certain line is passed"". In this respect, the rule of strict construction was closely allied with the presumption that Parliament did not intend statutes creating liabilities to have retrospective operation.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        [91] This second justification has been criticised on the basis that ""[t]hose who skate on thin ice can hardly expect to find a sign which will denote the precise spot where they may fall in"". However, such an argument, if accepted, could condone careless drafting practices. Because the criminal law is the most coercive instrument which the state possesses and because its application has potential implications for the loss of personal liberty, the legislature would normally be obliged to spell out with sufficient clarity the conduct that attracts criminal liability.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        [92] Thirdly, the rule of strict interpretation has sometimes been justified as upholding the separation of the respective roles of the legislature and the judiciary in determining the content of the criminal law. Courts have now relinquished the power to create new categories of criminal offences. Interpreting penal statues narrowly preserves this power exclusively for the legislature; but on terms of fairness to potential accused.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        [93]  
        Confinement of the rule to a last resort 
        : In recent times the rule of strict interpretation has ""lost much of its importance"", and is now generally regarded as a rule of ""last resort"". It comes into operation when the normal principles of interpretation have ""run out"", if ""all other indicia [have] failed"" to provide guidance. It applies ""if [there is] genuine doubt as to the intention of the legislature and if there are no considerations indicating the desirability of a wide interpretation of the statute"".  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        [94] The ordinary rules of construction are now first applied, including in the ascertainment of the meaning of penal and taxing legislation. In such categories, as much as anywhere else, it is the duty of a court to ascertain, and give effect to, the purpose of the legislature as expressed in the language enacted by Parliament. To some extent the demise in the attractiveness of the former rule of construction has followed the recognition by courts of the legitimacy of modern Parliaments, elected as they now are by universal suffrage. Artificial categories and exceptions are now less in favour than they formerly were. Nevertheless, somewhat like the  
        contra proferentem  
        rule (the occasionally useful principle of construction of insurance and like documents) the principle suggesting a stricter approach to the interpretation of penal legislation may sometimes prove useful when ambiguity seems intractable.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        [95] In the present case, a strict approach to interpretation of the contested provisions of the Crimes Act is of limited use. This is so because it is clear that Parliament provided for the offences of murder and of manslaughter and attached penal consequences to conviction. The debate about the meaning of s 18 of the Crimes Act is not advanced very far by incantations about the penal character of such a provision. This is especially so when the history of the offence of homicide is remembered, including the confusion and inconsistencies in that history, and the fact that an offence of manslaughter of broad ambit was deliberately preserved. Disputes over the detailed elements of that crime are unlikely to be resolved at this level of generality. Nevertheless, to the extent that the principle governing the interpretation of ambiguous provisions of penal statutes is available, the respondent invoked it to support the interpretation favoured by the majority in the Court of Criminal Appeal, pursuant to which he had been acquitted. So it is a rule to be kept in mind - but probably at the back of the mind leaving more pressing arguments to command the foreground. (Footnotes omitted) 
        
       
      
    34 Given the clear terms in which s39 of the Crimes Act (Cth) is expressed, terms which do not in my view admit on their face of that degree of doubt and/or ambiguity to which the rule might have a continuing application, I do not regard the rule providing for a strict approach to its interpretation as providing much in the way of guidance. 35 I do regard myself, however, as bound by other rules of construction which satisfy me that the construction for which the Crown contends cannot be maintained. In so holding, I am mindful of the argument the Crown advanced to the effect that the construction the accused contends for would render potential prosecutions of people in the position of the accused (as otherwise revealed by the evidence in the trial) impossible to prove, and that this must be contrary to the policy or object of the provision in its place with Part III of the Crimes Act (Cth). I am also mindful of the Crown’s express reliance on the observations of McClellan CJ at CL expressed in para [34] of judgment extracted above namely, that a restrictive or narrow interpretation to the section would or may encourage the destruction of evidence at an early stage, and by that means undermine the policy and purpose of the section. 36 While I am also obliged by s 15AA of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth) to take into account the policy or object of the s39 of the Crimes Act (Cth), and to prefer a construction that will promote the purpose or policy of the Act even if the meaning of the words of the section, interpreted in the context of the rest of the Act, is otherwise clear.  I am also obliged to give full textual meaning to the fault element the Parliament has provided for and its relationship to the physical element in the words of the section, as the Criminal Code (Cth) requires me to interpret it. I do not regard myself as obliged to stretch the plain words of the section and to torture their plain meaning in an endeavour to favour an interpretation that will render persons with the declared or revealed intention to destroy evidence liable to prosecution under this provision, when all that can be proved is that they knew that the evidence may be required in future proceedings simpliciter and thus to disregard the specific condition expressed by the definition of judicial proceedings. 37 In Newcastle City Council v GIO General Ltd (1997) 191 CLR 85 at [113] McHugh J said: 
     
      
       
        
        If the legislature uses language which covers one state of affairs, a court cannot legitimately construe the words of the section in a tortured and unrealistic manner to cover another set of circumstances. As Brennan CJ said in  
        IW v City of Perth  
        (1997) 191 CLR 1 at 12, even where a court adopts a purposive construction it ‘is not at liberty to give a construction that is unreasonable or unnatural’. 
        
       
      
    38 In my view, to read the section the way the Crown asks me to would be unreasonable and would fail to do credit to the actual words of the section. I note that the draftsperson provided neither punctuation or parentheses to separate out or signify a different reading of the composite clause “is or may be required in evidence in a judicial proceeding”. 39 The plain words of the section, and the declared operation of the Criminal Code (Cth) as provided for in the provisions of Chapter 2 to which I have referred, in my view require the prosecution to prove that an accused knew that the proceedings in which the evidence may be required were or are Federal judicial proceedings, even if the particular proceedings are not at the time of the destruction capable of being identified. 40 I am fortified in this conclusion by the fact that, in the comprehensive review of the many offences found across the body of Commonwealth statutes undertaken in 2000 and 2001, a review undertaken with a view to harmonising all offence creating and related provisions with the codified principles of criminal liability in Chapter 2 of the Criminal Code (Cth), the Parliament made no provision in s 39 for the physical circumstance of ‘judicial proceeding’ to be a matter of absolute liability or strict liability or otherwise a physical element requiring no fault element. By contrast, the Parliament has made express provision for physical elements or parts thereof to be matters of absolute or strict liability, and provided for no fault element in many offence-creating provisions of the Criminal Code (Cth) following the repeal of offences that had hitherto been located within the Crimes Act (Cth) (see for example ss131.1 and 132.1 under Part 7.2 of the Criminal Code (Cth).41 Absolute liability in respect of one component of a physical element cannot be read into the s 39. Neither can a requirement that there be no fault element in respect of a physical element or a component of a physical element. The Criminal Code (Cth) implicitly forbids it.  
     
      
    42 In these circumstances, on a proper construction of the section, the Crown must prove that the accused knew that the data may be required in Federal judicial proceedings and there being no evidence that he was at any relevant time aware of that fact, a verdict of not guilty must be directed.

     Leon Roderick CLAY v REGINA 
      
      
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ AT CL: I agree with Howie J. 
     
      
    2 HOWIE J: The applicant pleaded guilty in the Local Court to two offences: a robbery in company, contrary to s 97(1) of the Crimes Act and an assault occasioning actual bodily harm, contrary to s 59(1) of the Act. The robbery offence carried a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 20 years and the assault offence imprisonment for 5 years. He was committed for sentence to the District Court and came before Judge McLoughlin (the Judge) for sentence. He adhered to his pleas of guilty and in addition asked the Judge to take into account three offences on a Form 1. These were two further robbery in company offences and a malicious damage. 
     
      
    3 On 9 June 2006 the Judge sentenced the applicant on the robbery offence, and taking into account the Form 1 matters, to a term of imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 2 years 3 months and a balance of term of 2 years 3 months. The sentence commenced on 15 September 2005 and the applicant is eligible to be released to parole on 14 December 2007. In respect of the assault offence the applicant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 8 months with a balance of term of 7 months. That sentence was to be served from 15 September 2005 and therefore was completely concurrent with the sentence for the robbery offence. 
     
      
    4 The applicant seeks leave to appeal against his sentence relying upon grounds of appeal contending, firstly, that the Judge gave insufficient regard to evidence of the applicant’s mental illness and, secondly, that the sentence is manifestly excessive. 
     
      
    5 A lengthy statement of facts was handed up to the Judge by consent and was read out verbatim in the sentencing remarks. They can be summarised as follows. On 9 September 2005 four young men were walking from Lisarow railway station when they passed the applicant who was talking heatedly on a mobile phone. As they passed he made a comment to them but they ignored him. One of the victims said he had not heard anything and the applicant said, “I just got out a couple of days ago.” 
     
      
    6 There was a red vehicle parked opposite with the interior light on. The applicant said, “I’ve got a machete and I’ll cut you’se up” and then yelled in the direction of the red vehicle to bring the machete. The applicant then removed his shirt and told three of the young men to line up at the side of the footpath. He then asked for their wallets. The victim Tuiva said he had no money. The applicant repeated his demand and Tuiva handed over his wallet. The applicant, looking through the wallet, said that he now knew where he lived. The other two victims asked if they could give him money rather than their wallets, and the applicant agreed. One victim gave him ten dollars and the other 200 dollars. 
     
      
    7 The applicant then approached Tuiva and pushed him in the chest knocking him to the ground. He punched him to the face and head a number of times. He applied a choke hold on him and Tuiva struggled to free himself. At this time a co-offender produced a machete and told the applicant to hurry up otherwise he was going to “start hacking into his (Tuiva’s) back”. Tuiva stopped struggling and the applicant let him up. The applicant told him to “get lost”. The victims ran away and one contacted police. Tuiva had bruising, swelling and minor lacerations to his face. Later police stopped a vehicle and two males, one being the applicant, ran away. The applicant was arrested a short time later at the home of his parents. This incident gave rise to the charge of robbery in company and assault occasioning actual bodily harm upon Tuiva. The robbery of the other two victims was included as two charges on the Form 1. 
     
      
    8 The other matter on the Form 1 was an incident that occurred on 13 September when the applicant was being driven by his brother, who is crippled from spina bifida, in his brother’s vehicle. The applicant became more and more irate and eventually told his brother to pull over into a service station. The applicant began to berate his brother and eventually left the vehicle but before he did so kicked the interior panel of the vehicle causing significant damage. The brother then drove to the police station to report the damage. The applicant was arrested the next day. 
     
      
    9 The applicant was interviewed by police. He said that before the robbery offences he had ingested cannabis and a can of bourbon and coke. The applicant had been prescribed medication that he described as “mood stabilisers” but had not taken any for four days before the incident. He said that the person with the machete was a hitchhiker. In respect of the damage to his brother’s vehicle, the applicant told police that he became annoyed with his brother because of his driving and had to kick the door open so that he could get out of the vehicle. 
     
      
    10 The applicant was aged 21 years at the time of the offences. He has a criminal record dating back to 1999 in the Children’s Court. In March 2002 the court dealt with two offences, a resist police and trespassing, under s 32 of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act. In October 2002 the applicant was placed on a two year bond for a number of offences involving intimidation and driving matters. There were conditions that he accept supervision and psychiatric counselling. He was also sentenced to three months imprisonment for an aggravated break and enter offence. He was placed on bonds in both 2003 and 2004 for driving matters. On 19 September 2005 he was given a suspended sentence of 9 months for an offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. On 19 June 2006 he was sentenced to imprisonment for 6 months for offences of stealing from a dwelling and malicious damage. 
     
      
    11 There was in evidence a psychological report. It sets out the applicant’s background. He has three siblings and stated that he was brought up in an atmosphere of violence from his father. His parents separated when the applicant was aged 12 years. He initially resided with his mother and then with his father. From 2002 he lived independently with friends. He was educated to year 10 standard. He has completed a course in welding and has worked at times with his father. 
     
      
    12 He has a history of substance abuse. He commenced using alcohol at age thirteen and drank regularly by the age of 17. He has used cannabis also from the age of 13 and was using amphetamine and ecstasy at the time of his arrest. As a result of his use of drugs he would become angry and irrational and would not sleep for days. He acknowledged his drug problem to the psychologist and expressed a desire for help. 
     
      
    13 The applicant has a history of psychiatric disorders since 2001. He was admitted to a clinic in that year following symptoms of paranoia and visual and auditory hallucinations. He was diagnosed as suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder as a result of an assault by a gang when he was aged 16. He has been prescribed medication including Zoloft. He ceased taking his medication in 2002 and resumed amphetamine use resulting in him experiencing hallucinations. He sought assistance from a psychologist who diagnosed him as suffering Hypermania. He was instructed to resume his medication, which he did, and he remained well until 2005. He said that at his 21st birthday he was subject to a home invasion at his flat. Thereafter his paranoia increased. By August 2005 he was again using drugs and had stopped his medication. He continued to have delusions and hallucinations until he was arrested on these matters. He has been on medication while in custody. 
     
      
    14 The applicant told the psychologist that he had no recollection of the events giving rise to the offences because that period was a blur to him due to his intense drug taking and lack of sleep. He expressed remorse and empathy with the victims and his brother. On release he intends to live with his father and seek re-employment. He intends to stop using illegal substances and to take anger management courses. The psychologist indicated that the applicant needed counselling and assistance to address his drug use and might benefit from group therapy. 
     
      
    15 The applicant’s father gave evidence on sentencing. He stated that the applicant had a good relationship with his invalid brother and expressed the view that his behaviour in the motor vehicle was out of character. The father gave evidence that shortly before these offences he became aware that the applicant was psychiatrically unwell and sought to assist him. The applicant refused help and went to Cairns. His father later received a call from the applicant wanting money. His father tried to talk him into coming home but he was irrational. 
     
      
    16 The applicant also gave evidence. He admitted that he was not always compliant with his medication because sometimes he did not feel that he needed it. The following question and answers were given: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “Q ………do you agree that when you get that feeling you don’t always need it and you stop taking medication, that sometimes you get into trouble? 
         
         
        A. I do. 
         
         
        Q. So does that cause you to realise that even when you feel well you should continue taking the medication? 
         
         
        A. It’s hard to say.” 
        
       
      
    17 He gave evidence about his trip to Cairns that he said was to read the bible. It took three days and he did not sleep. He left as soon as he arrived after the phone call with his father. He drove back toward Sydney still unable to sleep. He was pulled over by the police in Coffs Harbour and told that he should not be driving. A friend then drove back to Sydney and he was on his way home when the robberies occurred. He said that his brother had been to see him in gaol and he apologised to him for his conduct. The applicant gave evidence as to his intentions to take his medication and not use illicit drugs upon his release. 
     
      
    18 As has been noted the Judge read the statement of facts into his sentencing remarks verbatim. He also included almost the whole of the psychologist’s report. He made reference to the father’s evidence, which he accepted. The Judge then referred to the guideline judgment in Henry and quoted some passages from the judgment of Sully J in R v Stanley [2003] NSWCCA 233. The Judge then said: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “Whilst it is true that in the current case the offender did not, at the time of robbery, have the machete in his possession, he was aware of its existence and had called for it at that time. In the current case the offender pleaded guilty at a very early time. There was no planning. There was violence inflicted after the robbery which the offender has pleaded guilty to the second of these charges. The victims were not as vulnerable as the ones referred to and there were small amounts taken. There is also the matters that have been taken into account on the schedule one, which include two other robberies in company, matters which cannot be ignored in the sentencing process. I am taking into account the Form 1 schedule. 
         
         
        Conviction on trial would in the view of this court result in a sentence of six years for robbery in company and twenty months for the assault occasioning actual bodily harm. I have taken into consideration the offender's very early plea of guilty as further evidence of his contrition and as having public utility and have reduced those sentences by twenty five per cent to four years six months and one year three months respectively. It has been submitted, and conceded by the Crown, that I should find special circumstances because of the age of the offender, prospects of rehabilitation, the agreed underlying psychiatric condition and the need for a lengthy period of supervision. I find special circumstances and accept those submissions and those facts”. 
        
       
      
    19 The Judge then stated that he had considered whether he should impose a partly cumulative sentence for the assault offence but said: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “On reflection as the offence occurred immediately after the above offence and in circumstances where the offender had not been taking his prescribed medication, and in the matters I am referred to, I am of the view that such a sentence should be concurrent”. 
        
       
      
    20 The first ground of appeal contends that the Judge failed to give sufficient regard to the applicant’s mental illness. The principles with regard to the sentencing of persons who are suffering from a significant mental disorder are well known. It is unnecessary to set them out again. The Court recently considered them in R v Henry [2007] NSWCCA 90. It must be borne in mind that, simply because an offender is suffering some form of mental illness or disorder, it does not necessarily follow that a lesser sentence will be imposed than if the person had not been suffering from a mental disorder. 
     
      
    21 The existence of a mental disorder may mean that the culpability of the offender is reduced, or that the full measure of general deterrence is not appropriate or that imprisonment will be more harsh. It also may be the case that the offender presents as a danger to the community and some measure of preventative detention is required. What has been made clear by the decisions of this Court is that it is primarily for the sentencing judge to determine how to apply the various, and sometimes conflicting, factors that arise when serious criminal offences are committed by mentally disordered persons. These are rarely simple sentencing exercises and reasonable minds might differ as to the weight to be given to particular factors. 
     
      
    22 It is clear that in the present case the Judge was well aware of the applicant’s mental condition and its relevance to the exercise of his discretion. He mentioned it in relation to his determination to find special circumstances and his decision to make the sentences for the two offences concurrent. This latter finding was one that was very favourable to the applicant. But criticism is made of the following statement in the Judge’s remarks: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “I take into account the offender’s psychiatric condition, not in mitigation but on the issue of deterrence.” 
         
        
       
      
    23 It is reasonably clear that the Judge meant that he was not reducing the applicant’s criminal culpability by reason of his mental illness but was going to take that matter into account in determining the weight to give to general deterrence. It would be clearly an error if his Honour thought that mental disability could not be a mitigating factor so far as an assessment of the criminality of the offender’s conduct was concerned. But I cannot believe that the Judge operated under such a misconception. It is axiomatic that a person’s mental state at the time of offending is relevant to an assessment of that person’s criminal culpability and hence the gravity of the offence, regardless of what has brought about that particular mental state. It is less obvious that a person’s mental disability may affect the weight to be given to general deterrence. 
     
      
    24 It is unfortunate that the Judge did not explain why he was not reducing the culpability of the applicant by reason of his mental illness having found that he was suffering from the illness at the time of offending. With respect there is little to be achieved in sentencing remarks from quoting almost in its entirety the contents of a psychiatric report without applying some analysis to the matters revealed in it. The Judge’s treatment of the mental illness of the applicant was unfortunately somewhat superficial. 
     
      
    25 It is clear in the present case that, like so many mentally ill offenders, the applicant failed to take his medication, used illegal drugs and this caused him to commit serious criminal offences. This was not the first occasion that the applicant’s mental state had deteriorated under these circumstances. He had previously come under psychiatric care for that reason and had been told that he was to continue to take his medication and avoid drugs. The applicant had chosen to stop taking medicine on this occasion and used illegal drugs. He must have known that this was likely to make him mentally unstable. The result was that he became irrational and aggressive and the offences were committed. It is clear from the answers quoted above that there must be some doubt about the applicant’s insight into his offending. In light of his history I would not be persuaded that his prospects of rehabilitation was strong notwithstanding that he said all the right things to the psychologist. 
     
      
    26 In these circumstances less weight should be given to the applicant’s mental illness as reducing his criminal culpability and more weight given to personal deterrence. He had twice before been before a court and orders were made requiring him to take his medication. This was in addition to instructions given to him by at least one psychiatrist. Although the facts of the matters are not known, the applicant was convicted for offences of intimidation in 2002, and this indicates some aggressive conduct had taken place. His father had tried to get him to see sense and seek treatment before he left for Cairns. 
     
      
    27 There was some unusual conduct by the applicant in the period leading up to the commission of the offences that was no doubt a result of his florid state. But the actual offences have nothing of the bizarre or abnormal about them. They showed clear thought processes and purposive behaviour. The applicant needed money. He had been on the phone angrily attempting to obtain some when the young men came by. True he might have picked on them because he thought that in some way they were antagonising him by perhaps looking at him. But he made statements intended to intimidate them and succeeded. He demanded their wallets but was prepared to take the money when offered to him by two of the victims. There was in fact a machete and it was produced during the incident. He subsequently lied about his conduct blaming a hitchhiker he picked up for committing the robbery. It is clear that he knew what he was doing and what he had done.  
     
      
    28 In my view it was open to his Honour to find that the applicant’s mental illness did not significantly affect his criminal conduct and, therefore, he was not in error in deciding not to mitigate the criminality of the offending by reason of the applicant’s mental state. But in any event the Judge in effect reduced the otherwise appropriate punishment by not making the sentence for the assault offence partially cumulative. This was a serious aggravation of the criminality in the robbery offence. It is one thing to obtain property by threats. It is quite another to assault a person simply because he had no money to hand over. 
     
      
    29 Complaint is made that the starting sentence of six years mentioned by his Honour was too high having regard to the range in Henry. The Judge made an error in giving the applicant the benefit of a 25 per cent discount for early plea yet the guideline has inbuilt a discount of 10 per cent for a late plea. There were three robberies here even though the applicant was being sentenced for only one. The matters on the Form 1 should have resulted in a heavier sentence by reason of denunciation for his conduct. Unlike the typical offender in the Henry guideline, the applicant had a criminal record of some significance and had served a period of custody previously, albeit briefly. True it is that there was no planning in the offence, but the Judge referred to this matter. 
     
      
    30 I am far from satisfied that there was any error in the remarks of the sentencing judge to the disadvantage of the applicant. The sentence, particularly the non-parole period, was a lenient one. I am not persuaded that the sentence was manifestly excessive. The applicant was given not only the benefit of a finding of special circumstances but a very generous reduction in the non-parole period. It is only 50 per cent of the head sentence. In my opinion no lesser non-parole period could be imposed upon the applicant and yet reflect the seriousness of the offences. 
     
      
    31 My conclusion that the appeal against sentence has no merit would normally lead to a proposal that leave be granted to appeal but that the appeal should be dismissed: see Bailey v Director of Public Prosecutions (1988) 62 ALJR 319; 34 A Crim R 154. However the Court has been informed that a co-offender of the applicant has recently been sentenced in the District Court. The Court has, therefore, been asked not to dismiss the appeal, if the Court were against the applicant on the arguments placed before it, but merely to refuse leave to appeal in order to permit the applicant to approach the Court if the issue of parity arises between the sentence imposed upon the applicant and that imposed upon the co-offender. That seems to me to be an appropriate course to take in the particular circumstances of this matter otherwise the applicant might be shut out from arguing a case of disparity that has merit. 
     
      
    32 Therefore I propose that the Court refuse the application for leave to appeal.

     Haydon John NEWMAN v REGINA 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 SPIGELMAN CJ: The Applicant was charged with three counts of assault said to have been committed on 22 June 2004 at Asquith Boys’ High School and one count of malicious wounding said to have been committed on 23 June 2004 at the same place. 
     
      
    2 He was in custody between the time of his arrest on 23 June 2004 and 11 November 2005. 
     
      
    3 A substantive issue concerning the Applicant’s mental health arose. The basic chronology is as follows: 
     
      
    · On 2 December 2004 a direction by the Attorney General was given for a fitness hearing, pursuant to the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990 (“the Act”). 
     
      
    · On 7 February 2005 the Applicant was found by a jury to be unfit to be tried pursuant to s14 of the Act. 
     
      
    · On 18 April 2005 the Mental Health Review Tribunal found that on the balance of probabilities, he would not become fit to be tried within a period of 12 months. 
     
      
    · On 1 August 2005 a special hearing under the Act was due to be held but the date was vacated. 
     
      
    · On 12 October 2005, by reason of defects in the above procedure, the Solicitor General directed that a fresh fitness hearing be held. 
     
      
    · On 18 November 2005 the Applicant was released on bail. 
     
      
    · On 14 July 2006 an election under s11A of the Act was filed so that the question of unfitness was to be determined by a judge alone. 
     
      
    · On 17 July 2006 the matter came before Nicholson DCJ. 
     
      
    · Counsel for the Applicant made an application under s10(4) of the Act seeking an order that the charges be dismissed and that the Applicant be released. 
     
      
    · On 18 July 2006 Nicholson DCJ dismissed the s10(4) application. 
     
      
    · On 4 October 2006 Nicholson DCJ issued a certificate under s5F(3)(b) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 with respect to his Honour’s judgment, certifying that the judgment was a proper one for determination by the Court of Criminal Appeal. 
     
      
    4 The certificate identified the following grounds: 
     
      
       
      “1 The learned trial judge erred in his interpretation of the operation of s10(4) of the  
      Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 
       1990. 
       
       
      2 The learned trial judge erred in his exercise of the discretions contained within s10(4) of the  
      Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 
       1990. 
       
       
      3 The learned trial judge erred in failing to dismiss the Appellant pursuant to s10(4) of the  
      Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 
       1990.” 
       
       
      The Background Facts 
       
      
    5 The relevant events upon which the charges were based were set out by his Honour as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “[14] The Crown case is that at 2 o’clock on 22 June, which was a Tuesday, the applicant attended the administration offices at Asquith Boys High School. On entering that office he approached the cash register section where Joan Wilson was sitting at a front desk. Another lady, Rhonda Christie, was also inside the office. The office is partitioned from the general public by a large double sliding glass window. One of these was open at the time.  
        
       
       
        
        [15] The applicant ignored inquiries from Ms Wilson as to why he was in the office or what he wanted. Using his body weight and both open palms he struck the closed portion of the sliding window. That caused the window to shatter towards Wilson and Christie. He continued to smash both sides of the window until the frame was completely empty of glass. 
        
       
       
        
        [16] The Crown case continues that whilst in the process of smashing the window the applicant took a shard of broken glass, aimed at Miss Wilson, and threw it. She ducked behind her desk to avoid being stuck. Miss Christie also took cover behind the same desk in fear of her safety. 
        
       
       
        
        [17] The applicant, whilst throwing and smashing the glass, was yelling ‘I want the fucking principal. Where’s the fucking principal. I want Mr Bonnor.’ Mr Bonnor had been principal, but was no longer principal, at Asquith Boys High School. He had taken, as it turns out, a more senior role in the Department. The current school principal, a Mr David Short, hearing from his own office, the applicant yelling and smashing glass came into the general office. He was immediately approached by the applicant who grabbed him on both shoulders and began to push the principal backwards into his office. All the time he was yelling ‘Who are you? I want Mr Bonnor.’ The applicant began to kick Short on both legs. The principal was unable to free himself but two members of staff came to his assistance and restrained the applicant until Police arrived. 
        
       
       
        
        [18] The applicant was bleeding from injuries he had received to his hands and forehead as a result of smashing the glass. He was handcuffed and conveyed to Hornsby Hospital where he was scheduled under the  
        Mental Health Act.  
        He was in fact assessed by the mental health team at the hospital and admitted to the Lindsay Madew Psychiatric Unit under a s22  
        Mental Health Act  
        Order. Later that day he absconded from the psychiatric unit. 
        
       
       
        
        [19] The following morning at about 11.40 he was back at the administration office at Asquith Boys’ High School. The applicant was holding a piece of terracotta piping in both hands above his head. He was approached by the deputy principal, a Mr Collins, who had recognised him from the previous day. Collins said to him ‘You, stop there.’ The applicant continued to walk towards Collins who attempted to restrain the applicant. The applicant then took a piece of terracotta piping and struck Collins to the rear of his head causing a laceration that bled profusely. This is the wound that the Crown rely upon. 
        
       
       
        
        [20] During the struggle the applicant dropped one of the pieces of terracotta piping on the stairs then picked up Collins and carried him to the administrative office area; for what purpose is unclear on these set of facts. Collins also sustained a graze to his forehead. Other members of staff came to Collins’ rescue and restrained the applicant until Police arrived.” 
        
       
       
      Jurisdiction 
       
      
    6 In written submissions Ms D Woodburne, who appeared for the Crown, identified two jurisdictional issues with respect to the application under s5F of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. The first matter raised was that the Notice was not filed within the time specified by r5B of the Criminal Appeal Rules and that no notice of application for extension of time accompanied the Notice of Appeal pursuant to r28 of the Criminal Appeal Rules.  
     
      
    7 The Crown did not oppose an extension of time. Mr M Ierace SC, who appeared for the Applicant, made such an application orally. In the circumstances the extension would be granted, subject to the other jurisdictional matter raised by Ms Woodburne. 
     
      
    8 Section 5F(3)(b) permits the Applicant, where a judge has provided a certificate, to appeal without leave “against an interlocutory judgment or order given or made in the proceedings”. 
     
      
    9 The Crown raised the question whether the dismissal by Nicholson DCJ of the application under s10(4) of the Act was “an interlocutory judgment or order given or made in proceedings” within the meaning of s5F(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. The Crown submitted that the issue is whether or not the application under s10(4) may be said to constitute a judgment, in that it determines an identifiable part of the proceedings (see R v Steffan (1993) 30 NSWLR 633), and could be said to be interlocutory, in the sense that it does not finally dispose of the rights of the parties (R v Pavia (1993) 67 A Crim R 364). 
     
      
    10 Mr Ierace SC submitted that the decision of Nicholson DCJ had the requisite character of finality. Section 10(4) required his Honour to determine the issue before a fitness inquiry was conducted. The Court could not, therefore, revisit the issue. The Applicant would have no further opportunity of availing himself of s10(4). He submitted the decision was interlocutory. 
     
      
       
      The Statutory Scheme 
       
      
    11 At the time of the application under s10(4), s10 provided: 
     
      
       
        
        “10(1) If, in respect of an offence:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) the Attorney General determines that an inquiry should be conducted and does not subsequently determine, before the inquiry is commenced, that there is no longer any need for such an inquiry to be conducted, or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) the question of a person’s unfitness to be tried for the offence is raised after the person is arraigned on a charge in respect of the offence, 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        the Court must (except as provided by this section), as soon as practicable after the Attorney General’s determination is made or the question is raised, as the case may be, conduct an inquiry in order to determine whether the person is unfit to be tried for the offence. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) The Court must not conduct an inquiry into the question of a person’s unfitness to be tried for an offence unless it appears to the Court that the question has been raised in good faith. 
        
       
       
        
        (3) Before conducting an inquiry, the Court may do any one or more of the following:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) adjourn the proceedings, 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) grant the accused person bail in accordance with the  
          Bail Act  
          1978, 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) remand the accused person in custody for a period not exceeding 28 days, 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (d) request the accused person to undergo a psychiatric examination or other examination, 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (e) request that a psychiatric report or other report relating to the accused person be obtained, 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (f) discharge any jury constituted for the purpose of those proceedings, 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (g) make any other order that the Court considers appropriate. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (4) If, in respect of a person charged with an offence, the Court is of the opinion that it is inappropriate, having regard to the trivial nature of the charge or offence, the nature of the person’s disability or any other matter which the Court thinks proper to consider, to inflict any punishment, the Court may determine not to conduct an inquiry and may dismiss the charge and order that the person be released.” 
        
       
      
    12 Section 11 of the Act provided that the determination of a person’s unfitness for trial was to be made by a jury. However, the judge was empowered to determine the issue alone in the circumstances set out in s11A. The Act has subsequently been amended in this respect to establish a regime where fitness to be tried is to be determined by a judge alone in all circumstances.  
     
      
    13 In order to understand one of the authorities to be considered below, it is relevant to set out part of s11 and s11A as previously in force: 
     
      
       
        
        “11(1) The question of a person’s unfitness to be tried for an offence is to be determined by a jury constituted for that purpose, except as provided by section 11A. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        11A(1) The question of a person’s unfitness to be tried for an offence is to be determined by the Judge alone if the person so elects in accordance with this section and the Judge is satisfied that the person, before making the election, sought and received advice in relation to the election from a barrister or solicitor. 
        
       
       
        
        … ” 
        
       
      
    14 The immediate context of s10 was Pt 2 of the Act. At all times ss4-9 and 12 provided: 
     
      
       
        
        “4 This Part applies to criminal proceedings in the Supreme Court (including criminal proceedings within the summary jurisdiction of the Supreme Court) and criminal proceedings in the District Court. 
        
       
       
        
        5 The question of a person’s unfitness to be tried for an offence may be raised by any party to the proceedings in respect of the offence or by the Court. 
        
       
       
        
        6 The question of a person’s unfitness to be tried for an offence is to be determined on the balance of probabilities. 
        
       
       
        
        7(1) The question of a person’s unfitness to be tried for an offence is, so far as practicable, to be raised before the person is arraigned on a charge in respect of the offence but may be raised at any time during the course of the hearing of the proceedings in respect of the offence. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) Nothing in this section prevents the question of a person’s unfitness to be tried for an offence from being raised on more than one occasion in respect of the same proceedings. 
        
       
       
        
        8(1) If the question of a person’s unfitness to be tried for an offence is raised at any time before the person is arraigned on a charge in respect of the offence, the Attorney General must determine whether an inquiry should be conducted before the hearing of the proceedings in respect of the offence. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) The Attorney General may, at any time before the inquiry is commenced, determine that there is no longer any need for such an inquiry to be conducted. 
        
       
       
        
        9 If the question of a person’s unfitness to be tried for an offence is raised after the person is arraigned on a charge in respect of the offence, the Court must hear any submissions relating to the conducting of an inquiry in the absence of any jury which has been constituted for the purposes of the proceedings relating to the offence. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        12(1) At an inquiry, the accused person is, unless the Court otherwise allows, to be represented by counsel or a solicitor. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) An inquiry is not to be conducted in an adversary manner. 
        
       
       
        
        (3) The onus of proof of the question of a person’s unfitness to be tried for an offence does not rest on any particular party to the proceedings in respect of the offence. 
        
       
       
        
        (4) At the commencement of an inquiry the Court is to explain to the jury the reason for the inquiry, the findings which may be made on the inquiry and the consequences, both at law and otherwise, of those findings.” 
        
       
      
    15 The Act makes provision for the alternative circumstances in which a person is found fit or found unfit to be tried. Where found fit, s13 provides that proceedings will occur “in accordance with the appropriate criminal procedures”. 
     
      
    16 Where a person is found unfit, the person must be referred to the Mental Health Review Tribunal pursuant to s14. Where the Tribunal finds that the person would not be fit within 12 months, provision is made for a special hearing under the Act at the direction of the Attorney General. 
     
      
    17 At the time of the application in the present case, the relevant provisions with respect to a special hearing were: 
     
      
       
        
        “19(1) If the Attorney General directs that a special hearing be conducted in respect of an offence with which a person is charged, the appropriate Court must, as soon as practicable after the Attorney General so directs, conduct a special hearing for the purpose of ensuring, despite the unfitness of the person to be tried in accordance with the normal procedures, that the person is acquitted unless it can be proved to the requisite criminal standard of proof that, on the limited evidence available, the person committed the offence charged or any other offence available as an alternative to the offence charged. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) The question whether a person has committed an offence charged or any other offence available as an alternative to an offence charged is, except as provided by section 21A, to be determined at a special hearing by a jury constituted for that purpose. 
        
       
       
        
        (3) The  
        Jury Act  
        1977 applies to and in respect of the constitution of a jury and a jury constituted as referred to in subsection (2) in the same way as it applies to and in respect of the constitution of a jury and a jury for the trial of any criminal proceedings. 
        
       
       
        
        (4) A member of a jury otherwise constituted for the purpose of any proceedings relating to the same accused person and the same offence is disqualified from being a member of a jury constituted as referred to in this section. 
        
       
      
    18 Section 21 made provision for a special hearing by judge alone. The Act further provided: 
     
      
       
        
        “22(1) The verdicts available to the jury or the Court at a special hearing include the following:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) not guilty of the offence charged, 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) not guilty on the ground of mental illness, 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) that on the limited evidence available, the accused person committed the offence charged, 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (d) that on the limited evidence available, the accused person committed an offence available as an alternative to the offence charged. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (2) A verdict in accordance with subsection (1)(b) is to be taken to be equivalent for all purposes to a special verdict that an accused person is not guilty by reason of mental illness under section 38. 
        
       
       
        
        (3) A verdict in accordance with subsection (1)(c) or (d):  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) constitutes a qualified finding of guilt and does not constitute a basis in law for any conviction for the offence to which the finding relates, and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) subject to section 28, constitutes a bar to further prosecution in respect of the same circumstances, and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) is subject to appeal in the same manner as a verdict in an ordinary trial of criminal proceedings, and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (d) is to be taken to be a conviction for the purpose of enabling a victim of the offence in respect of which the verdict is given to make a claim for compensation. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        23(1) If, following a special hearing, it is found on the limited evidence available that an accused person committed the offence charged or some other offence available as an alternative, the Court:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) must indicate whether, if the special hearing had been a normal trial of criminal proceedings against a person who was fit to be tried for the offence which the person is found to have committed, it would have imposed a sentence of imprisonment, and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) where the Court would have imposed such a sentence, must nominate a term, in this section referred to as  
          a limiting term 
          , in respect of that offence, being the best estimate of the sentence the Court would have considered appropriate if the special hearing had been a normal trial of criminal proceedings against a person who was fit to be tried for that offence and the person had been found guilty of that offence. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (2) If a Court indicates that it would not have imposed a sentence of imprisonment in respect of a person, the Court may impose any other penalty or make any other order it might have made on conviction of the person for the relevant offence in a normal trial of criminal proceedings. 
        
       
       
        
        (3) Any such other penalty imposed or order made, under subsection (2), is to be subject to appeal in the same manner as a penalty or order in a normal trial of criminal proceedings. 
        
       
       
        
        (4) In nominating a limiting term in respect of a person or imposing any other penalty or making any other order, the Court may, if it thinks fit, take into account the periods, if any, of the person’s custody or detention before, during and after the special hearing (being periods related to the offence). 
        
       
       
        
        (5) A limiting term nominated in respect of a person takes effect from the time when it is nominated unless the Court, after taking into account the periods, if any, of the person’s custody or detention before, during and after the special hearing (being periods related to the offence), directs that the term be taken to have commenced at an earlier time.” 
        
       
      
    19 There is further detailed provision, which it is unnecessary to set out. 
     
      
       
      The s5F Issue 
       
      
    20 In my opinion, this Court has jurisdiction. 
     
      
    21 The decision by Nicholson DCJ to refuse the application for a determination not to conduct the inquiry and dismiss the charge was a discrete process ancillary to the principal proceedings. It was a decision on an “identifiable” and “separate” part of the proceedings. (See R v Steffan (1993) 30 NSWLR 633 at 636A.) It was clearly interlocutory in that it did not finally dispose of the rights of the parties. (Licul v Corney (1976) 180 CLR 213 at 225.) 
     
      
    22 In R v Mifsud (NSWCCA Unreported 8 November 1995), Gleeson CJ, with whom Levine and Dowd JJ agreed, determined that the decision of a judge, pursuant to s11A of the Act, that there had not been an effective election for a trial by judge alone and that, therefore, the fitness hearing had to proceed before a jury, was an interlocutory judgment within s5F. The present case is not, in my opinion, distinguishable. 
     
      
       
       
      Reasons of Nicholson DCJ 
       
      
    23 With respect to the issue of law which has been argued before this Court his Honour said, after summarising relevant facts: 
     
      
       
        
        “[45] In my view these offences would call for punishment in the event that the applicant was found guilty of them, or in the event that the applicant was found, on the limited evidence, to have committed the offences.  
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        [49] Again the interpretation of the section presents a problem. In the course of argument I expressed the view that upon a finding of guilt, or that on limited evidence the offence had been committed, the court would take into account any time served when turning to the question of sentence. It could do that for example by backdating a sentence, or by coming to a view that no further punishment was required. 
        
       
       
        
        [50] It seems to me there is a difference between the proposition ‘it is inappropriate to inflict any punishment’ and ‘it is inappropriate to inflict any further punishment’. In this case there is a real likelihood open, on the evidence, of time served and rehabilitation progress thus far made, and assessing, as best one can, the objective criminality of the facts as contained in the summary of facts from which I have read that no further punishment would be imposed. Nonetheless there may be a conviction or a limited finding that the offence was committed. 
        
       
       
        
        [51] Those findings, while adverse, may not qualify as ‘punishment’ as meant in s10(4). But the potential for adverse findings in respect of the four charges on the indictment, would yield the inescapable conclusion that it would not be inappropriate for the judge to inflict punishment in the light of those findings standing alone. It is only when one adds to those findings the subjective history of time served and rehabilitation that one comes to a view that no ‘further’ punishment is required. 
        
       
       
        
        [52] A finding is still open, even though I have expressed a view that in the light of the offender’s current rehabilitation status, there is a real likelihood I would inflict no further punishment – that is a finding that it is inescapable that it would not be inappropriate for the Court to inflict punishment even in the light of my findings.” 
        
       
      
    24 His Honour concluded his judgment with the following: 
     
      
       
        
        [58] In all the circumstances, I find that it would not be inappropriate for a judge to inflict punishment in the light of these findings. The application is refused.” 
        
       
      
    25 As I understand his Honour’s reasoning, he did apply a test of “inappropriate to inflict any punishment”, not a test of “inappropriate to inflict further punishment”. This appears from his conclusion at [58], in view of his reasoning at [45] and [52]. 
     
      
       
      The Appellant’s Submissions 
       
      
    26 Nicholson DCJ was influenced in his analysis by the judgment of Meagher JA in Director of Public Prosecutions v Mills [2000] NSWCA 236, where his Honour identified what appeared to him to be a number of difficulties with the interpretation of s10(4). These difficulties were also emphasised in the Appellant’s submissions in this Court. 
     
      
    27 The Appellant contends that Nicholson DCJ failed to have regard to the aim and purpose of the legislative scheme and erred in his interpretation of the phrase “inappropriate to inflict any punishment”. In particular, the Appellant contended that his Honour erred in approaching the task as if he was a sentencing judge.  
     
      
    28 The Appellant submitted that the purpose of the Act was to provide appropriate procedures for persons with a mental illness and/or mental condition, which respond to the capacity of such person to stand trial and give instructions with due consideration to their disability. It was submitted that the Act makes provision for what was described as “specific and more flexible procedures for the disposal of offences alleged to have been committed by a person who has cognitive or mental disability”.  
     
      
    29 The Appellant submitted that s10(4) conferred a very broad discretion, which gave the Court considerable flexibility to examine the totality of factors relevant to the person charged with the offence at the time the question of fitness was raised. For example, it was submitted that the Court should take into account the complexity and length of time involved in dealing with the Applicant if proceedings were to continue in accordance with the Act by way of a fitness hearing. 
     
      
    30 In the context of the facts of the present case, the Appellant submitted that the breadth of the discretion under s10(4) was such that it was permissible to take into account the fact that the Appellant had been remanded in custody for some 17 months. Accordingly, his Honour erred in approaching his task as if it were akin to a sentencing exercise in which the period of prior incarceration could be taken into account, most relevantly, by backdating any sentence. For that reason, the Appellant submitted, his Honour erred in the interpretation of the words “inappropriate to inflict any punishment” when he concluded that the offences did warrant some punishment, even if he may not have imposed any “further punishment”. 
     
      
    31 The Appellant also submitted, on the above analysis, that the statutory scheme would be defeated if the issue of ‘inappropriateness’ focused on the guilt of the accused and the seriousness of the offences. It was submitted, to adopt the language of the written submissions, that this approach would be based “on disposition based on guilt rather than disability” and this was an error. 
     
      
    32 There was also a challenge to the exercise by his Honour of the discretion said to be found in s10(4). The Appellant submitted that his Honour’s reference to the judgment of the Court of Appeal in Director of Public Prosecutions v El Mawas [2006] NSWCA 154, was in error because of the distinction between s32, under consideration in that case, and s10(4) in this case. However, his Honour clearly expressed, at [57], his understanding of the difference between the two sections. There is no basis for any interference with his Honour’s exercise of discretion in this respect. 
     
      
    33 It was also submitted that his Honour’s exercise of discretion miscarried because his Honour failed to give adequate weight to what was described as the “diversionary/disability purposes of the Act” and gave too much weight to the seriousness of the offence and the likely finding of guilt based on the objective facts. In particular it was submitted that he gave insufficient weight to matters such as the Appellant’s intellectual disability, his epilepsy and other subjective matters. 
     
      
       
      Interpreting s10(4) 
       
      
    34 The Appellant’s submission about the scope and purpose of the legislative scheme should be rejected. The purpose of the Act is not, in my opinion, to provide “specific and flexible procedures for the disposal of offences committed by persons who have a cognitive or mental disability”. The Appellant’s reference to the “diversionary/disability” purposes of the legislative scheme is also, in my opinion, incorrect. Similarly, it is not correct to infer that a focus “on disability” as distinct from a “focus on guilt” is required. I am unable to detect any such purposes in the legislative scheme. Finally, the Appellant’s contention that the discretion is “broad” is likely to lead to error. The section confers a judicial discretion for specific purposes.  
     
      
    35 The relevant part of the Act is concerned to establish a regime for the determination of criminal guilt or innocence in circumstances where normal criminal procedures could not apply by reason of the mental condition of an accused at the time of trial. It is incorrect to describe the procedures as “diversionary” or as “flexible”. They are alternative procedures designed to ensure that justice is done having in mind the possibility of a person’s unfitness to be tried. Justice must, however, be done not only to the accused but to the victim, bearing in mind the public interest in resolving allegations of criminal conduct. 
     
      
    36 Section 10(4) is expressly directed to the appropriateness of the infliction of punishment. A judgment that punishment would be “inappropriate” leads to the result that the inquiry called for would not occur and the charge will be dismissed. Significant weight is to be attached to this consequence. A person charged with crime will never be tried. 
     
      
    37 The use of the word “punishment” indicates, in my opinion, that what the Parliament had in mind was an end result in which the person accused was in fact convicted, either expressly or by special hearing, of the relevant offence. This section is not, in my opinion, concerned with the possibility of a finding of not guilty, whether simpliciter or on the grounds of mental illness at the time of the offence. Nevertheless, the result of the process is that the proceedings are dismissed without trial. 
     
      
    38 I do not share any of the difficulties of interpretation identified by Meagher JA in DPP v Mills supra at [3]-[8]. The two circumstances in which an issue of ‘punishment’ arises can only be either as a result of conviction after a normal trial, where the person has been found fit to plead, or as a result of a finding of guilty of the offence “on the limited evidence available”, following a special hearing within the meaning of s22(1). The latter finding is identified in s22(3) as a “qualified finding of guilt”. Upon such a finding the court can determine under s23 a “limiting term” of imprisonment or some other penalty or make any other order which the court could have made “on conviction … in a normal trial of criminal proceedings”. 
     
      
    39 In my opinion, s10(4) has in mind both situations i.e. where a person is found fit to plead and is convicted and where the qualified finding of guilt is made after a special hearing. The principal purpose of the subsection is to avoid the unnecessary delays, costs and complications of the special procedure, which arises only in the case where an issue of unfitness to plead has arisen at or about the time of trial and which operates irrespective of whether or not any mental illness was pertinent at the time of the commission of the offence.  
     
      
    40 The principal purpose of the fitness hearing is to facilitate the administration of criminal justice. The administration of criminal justice would not be enhanced in any manner, whether from the point of view of an accused or from that of a victim or from the point of view of the public interest, if the considerable added expense and delay of a fitness hearing is to be undertaken in circumstances where the court would, in the event, not inflict any punishment. 
     
      
    41 The reference to “any punishment” in s10(4) would, in my opinion, extend to the recording of a conviction which, of itself, without any additional penalty, has effects such as consequential effects on prospects of employment, loss of licences or a range of statutory consequences and, possibly, public opprobrium. (On public opprobrium see Ryan v The Queen (2001) 206 CLR 267 esp at [52]-[54]; [123]; c/f [177].) On other adverse consequences of a conviction see R v Lancaster (1991) 58 A Crim R 290; Application by the Attorney General under Section 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act (No 3 of 2002) (2004) 61 NSWLR 305; [2004] NSWCCA 303 at [114]; R v Rhodes (NSWCCA Unreported 20 November 1996).) In my opinion, the recording of a conviction is itself a “punishment” within s10(4) of the Act. In any event, it is well established that the orders of the court after a special hearing constitute punishment. (DPP v Mills supra at [38]-[39]; Smith v The Queen [2007] NSWCCA 39 at [61]-[63].) 
     
      
    42 The formulation in s10(4) is analogous to the long-standing formulation which permits a court to dismiss a charge without recording a conviction even where the charge is proved. This provision is now found in s10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. At the time that s10(4) of the Act was first enacted in 1983 as s428F(5) of the Crimes Act 1900, the relevant section was s556A of the Crimes Act. 
     
      
    43 Section 556A relevantly stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “556A Where … the court thinks that the charge is proved, but is of the opinion that, having regard to the character, antecedents, age, health, or mental condition of the person charged, or to the trivial nature of the offence, or to the extenuating circumstances under which the offence was committed, it is inexpedient to inflict any punishment … the court may, without proceeding to conviction, make an order … dismissing the charge.” 
        
       
      
    44 The basic structure of s10(4) and s556A is the same. In each case, relevantly, the ultimate power of the court is to dismiss a charge that has been, or may be, proven. The respective tests are equivalent, although the word “inexpedient” is replaced by what may appear to be more apposite terminology in the context of mental disability, i.e. “inappropriate”. The list of matters to which regard may be had overlaps considerably, although the list in s556A has been shortened and a general, but not unrestricted, provision relating to “any other matter” inserted. 
     
      
    45 Nevertheless, in my opinion, the general approach adopted to s556A, and now to s10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, is the correct general approach to adopt for the purposes of s10(4) of the Act. The task is to be conducted in anticipation of a finding of guilt, by either of the two courses which can flow from a fitness hearing, i.e. a normal criminal trial or a special hearing. 
     
      
    46 Section 10(4) requires the court to approach an application on the assumption of a finding of guilt, including a finding of qualified guilt, and then to apply a similar range of considerations as now arise under s10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. It permits the court to dismiss a charge without proceeding to a fitness hearing, on the assumption that there would be a finding of guilt if the matter did proceed to either a trial or a special hearing. Where the court would not impose any punishment, including the element of punishment implicit in a conviction, then the proceedings should be dismissed in limine without the need for a fitness hearing. 
     
      
       
      Conclusion 
       
      
    47 In my opinion, reading the judgment of Nicholson DCJ as a whole, his Honour did approach the matter in the correct manner. He correctly placed himself in the position of a sentencing judge after a conviction, albeit hypothetically. He referred to the possibility that he would not inflict any additional punishment, over and above the period served in custody, but expressly stated that the offences would call for punishment if a finding of guilt were made. (See at [45], [52] and [58] set out at [21] above.) I can see no error that would justify the intervention of this Court. 
     
      
    48 In my opinion, leave to appeal out of time should be granted but the appeal should be dismissed.

    SENTENCE1 On 4 July I granted section 11 [Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999] bail to Justin Moroney for an offence of robbery in company of a twenty-one year old uni student Jason Chan. The details and circumstances of that robbery were reviewed in some detail in remarks made by me at the time. Among the matters that persuaded me to give Moroney an opportunity to establish that he could rehabilitate were: 
     
     The robbery itself was one that fell towards the less serious range of robberies in company with corporal violence. 
     The offender’s role in the robbery was one of the lesser roles. 
     The offender had been in prison unable to make bail when he had been serious sexually assaulted. 
     He appeared to have strong family support, especially from his mother and brother. 
     There was report of him being overly dependent upon his mother. 
     In the past he had placed himself in a rehabilitation program, suggesting a willingness to engage in rehabilitation. 
     He had suffered traumatic brain injury as a result of a vicious assault some time before this offence. 
     There was evidence before me of an extensive community based program that would assist Moroney rehabilitate and recommendations from professionals then involved with the offender to pursue that course. 
    2 In giving him bail pursuant to section 11 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act a number of conditions were imposed, including that he be of good behaviour. Others related to his continued interaction with professionals relating to his health, drug and alcohol problems and vocational issues. He was also required to attend Court at regular intervals so his progress could be monitored. Initially his response was modest at best, from that it deteriorated. Eventually it reached a point where his response was so poor that his bail was revoked. 3 It has now become necessary to sentence Moroney for his part in the robbery of Chan in company with corporal violence. Mr Barber, who has appeared for Justin Moroney throughout, has submitted that in setting the sentence I should consider fixing a sentence that would permit me to refer the offender to the compulsory Drug Court rehabilitation program. 4 The sentence I am inclined to fix may well have fallen within the parameters to make the offender eligible. However, eligibility criteria is determined by section 5A of the Drug Court Act (1998), it is in the following terms:“5A Definition of “eligible convicted offender”: 
     
      
      (1) A person is an eligible convicted offender if: 
       
      (a) the person is convicted of an offence, other than an offence referred to in subsection (2) and 
       
      (b) the person has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment for the offence to be served by way of full-time detention and the unexpired non-parole period in relation to that sentence is: 
       
      (i) at the time the Drug Court is determining whether to make a compulsory treatment order with respect to the person a period of no more than 3 years, and 
       
      (ii) at the time that the sentence was imposed a period of at least 18 months, and 
       
      (c) the person has, in the 5 year period immediately before the person was sentenced, been  
      convicted 
       under a law of this State or under a law of the Commonwealth or another State or Territory or of another country, of at least 2 other offences, not being offences arising out of the same circumstances, that resulted in any one or more of the following: 
       
      (i) a sentence of imprisonment (including a sentence of imprisonment that was suspended), 
       
      (ii) the making of a community service order (however described), 
       
      (iii) the entry into a good behaviour bond or recognizance (however described), and 
       
      (d) the person has a long-term dependency on the use of prohibited drugs (within the meaning of the  
      Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 
       1985) or other drugs prescribed the regulations, and 
       
      (e) the facts in connection with the offence for which the person has been sentenced, together with the person’s antecedents and any other information available, indicate that the offence was related to the person’s long-term drug dependency and associated lifestyle, and 
       
      (f) the person satisfied such other criteria as are prescribed by the regulations. 
       
      (2) A person is not an eligible convicted offender if the person has been convicted of any of the following:” (None of these offences apply in the instant case) 
       
      “(3) A person is not an eligible convicted offender if, in the opinion of the Drug Court: 
       
      (a) the person suffers form a mental condition, illness or disorder: 
       
      (i) that is serious, or 
       
      (ii) leads to the person being violent, and 
       
      (b) the mental condition, illness or disorder could prevent or restrict the person’s active participation in a drug treatment program.” 
      
    5 There are two aspects of the definition that are of concern, namely whether Moroney has the requisite number of convictions and, if so, whether his mental health condition would otherwise preclude him from eligibility.6 Whether his mental health condition precludes him from selection is ultimately a decision for those who administer the compulsory drug treatment program (in the opinion of the Drug Court). That would not mean that I would have no regard to his mental condition and the likelihood of him passing or finding the statutory criteria of (a) suffering from a mental condition, illness or disorder that is serious or leads to him being violent, and is of such a quality that it could prevent or restrict his active participation in the drug treatment program. 7 As reviewed in the remarks made by me on 4 July last year, the offender does suffer from a mental condition that is serious. However, there is the second leg, that is, would it prevent or restrict his participation in the drug treatment program. It is certainly open on the evidence that in a structured situation such as the compulsory drug treatment program the offender would not be ruled out on that second leg. If not ruled out on the second leg, then his eligibility would depend upon whether he had the relevant prior convictions. 8 Given that it would be open for the Drug Court to come to one view or another on the impact of his serious mental condition and his capacity to participate actively in the drug treatment program, it is not appropriate for me to exclude the offender on that consideration. 9 However, it appears to me Moroney does not quality for the compulsory drug treatment program upon the basis of section 5A(1)(c) of the Drug Court Act. That requires that he be convicted of at least two other offences in a five year period. It is true those offences do not have to predate the offence with which I am dealing but certainly have to predate today’s date, that is the date on which the sentence is to be imposed. 10 A review of the offender’s criminal history shows that as an adult there is a conviction and a section 9 bond for breaking, entering a building. The charge for that offence appears to have occurred on 24 August 2005. He was convicted by Manly Local Court on 14 February 2007 for entering enclosed lands without lawful excuse. That offence is said to have occurred during the bail that I gave him on 18 November 2006. For that offence he was fined $200. There is also a shoplifting offence dealt with on the same occasion, for which he was fined $500. On 29 November 2006 he was again charged with enter enclosed lands. That matter was also dealt with on 14 February 2007 and he was fined $200. It is to be remembered he surrendered the day following those convictions. 11 I understand there are other charges he faces, where the convictions recorded by the Local Court have now been annulled. They do not appear to be any of the offences to which I have just referred. It can be seen in respect of these offences he has been fined on all occasions but for one when a section 9 bond was received for the breaking, entering and stealing that occurred on 24 August 2005. In other words none of the other offences he has committed as an adult are sufficient to qualify as two convictions for which he has either received a sentence of imprisonment, a community service order or a good behaviour bond.12 Mr Barber noted that as a juvenile he had been placed on probation on half a dozen occasions but in each case it was without conviction being recorded. Whether these offences qualify as offences connected with his drug dependency was not proved in evidence but for the purposes of proceeding I am prepared to assume that at least some of them do. 13 Putting that issue then to one side, Mr Barber sought to argue that I would find, for the purposes of the Drug Court Act, the placing of an offender on a probation could be construed as a relevant conviction or could be construed as an entry into a good behaviour bond or recognizance upon conviction. He pointed to the fact that section 10 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act discharges can be construed, for the purposes of some Acts, for instance Motor Traffic Points Schemes, as a conviction. However, that argument cannot succeed. Where section 10 discharges are so regarded as convictions for some particular purpose, there is a statutory provision to that effect. I have not had the time to research over the weekend but I will if necessary find the relevant provision and include it there. 14 The common law position in regard to convictions was reviewed at length in Griffiths v The Queen (1976-77) 137 CLR 293. Convictions have a particular significance and stigma in the criminal law. There is no warrant to imply a conviction if the statutory or common law does not mandate it. While it is true the compulsory drug treatment program is a statutory provision relating to enforced rehabilitation, that concept as best I can determine it, was first referred to by Barwick CJ in Griffiths (ante). Enforced rehabilitation is, in a sense, beneficial to a prisoner. Thus one would expect, when interpreting the statute creating an entitlement to it, that one would seek to make it “inclusive” rather “exclusive”. 15 But to do so in this case would fly in the face of the meaning given to “conviction” in the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987, (see sections 14 and 15). 16 Section 14 of that Act gives or recognises a power of a court to deal with a child who has pleaded guilty to, or been found guilty of, an offence which is disposed of summarily, by refusing to record a conviction in relation to a child who is above the age of sixteen. Section 15 of the Act provides that such a person - who does not have a conviction, and has not within a period of two years prior to the commencement of other proceedings with which he is being dealt - can not have that matter of the prior offence led in those proceedings, say by way of bad character evidence, or by way of sentencing in relation to an appropriate penalty for prior offending [in a court other than the Children's Court]. My view is that the offender does not qualify [as an ""eligible convicted person""] on the basis of his convictions. 17 What I propose to do now is to proceed to sentence him. In so doing I stress that I have taken into account all of the matters that I referred to in my remarks made on 4 July 2006. I have taken into account the time that he has been in custody, which I have equated to eight weeks and four days. That eight weeks and four days is comprised of seven weeks and four days actual custody and seven days allowed for a fourteen day period when the offender was in full-time rehabilitation in Kempsey. The consequence of doing that is to require me to backdate this sentence to 1 February 2007. 18 Could you stand up please Mr Moroney? Mr Moroney, I must have convicted you of the offence already, for that offence, that you on 30 March 2005 at Beacon Hill robbed Jason Chan of cash and immediately before the robbery used corporal violence on him, I sentence you to fifteen months non-parole to date from 1 February 2007 and to expire on 30 April 2008. I set a balance of term of nine months, to expire on 30 January 2009. I order your release to parole on 30 April 2008. 19 I recommend to those whose ultimate decision is to set the conditions for your parole, that you be subject to close and intense supervision and that items discussed in the original bail conditions set for you be considered as appropriate for you to engage in whilst on parole. Any other order?

      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1 HER HONOUR: By Amended Summons filed in court on 3 April 2007, the plaintiff appeals, pursuant to s115A of the Crimes (Forensic Procedures) Act 2000 (“the Act”) and Part 5 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001, against an order made under the Act in the Local Court at Armidale on 9 March 2007 by magistrate Michael Holmes. The formal order was expressed in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “I, Michael North Holmes … at the Local Court at Armidale on 9 March 2007 having been satisfied of the matters referred to under [the Act] make orders authorising the carrying out of a Non Intimate forensic procedure being,  
         
        1) buccal swab 2) hair sample 3)photograph 
         
        and if the suspect refuses the procedures listed 1) 2) 3), a blood test, 
         
        on F V of Banksia Mental Health Unit Tamworth. 
        
       
       
        
        I order that F V … attend at the time and place directed for the carrying out of the forensic procedure. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        This Order is made under section 24 of [the Act].” 
        
       
      
    2 In the formal record of the order, there follows a statement of “Reasons for Order”, in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “I note that under s8 of the Act, the suspect cannot consent to the forensic procedure. 
        
       
       
        
        1) I am satisfied (s25 of the Act) that; 
         
          
          a) the person is a suspect (as defined in s3 of the Act) and; 
           
          b) on the evidence before me there are reasonable grounds to believe that the suspect committed an indictable offence namely Murder. 
           
          c) Based on the affidavit and oral evidence of the case officer Detective Senior Constable Borghouts there are reasonable grounds to believe that the forensic procedure might produce evidence tending to confirm or disprove that the suspect committed the relevant offence based upon the material place (sic) before the court. 
           
          d) The carrying out of the forensic procedure is justified in all the circumstances. 
           
          e) The probative value of the evidence obtained as a result of the forensic procedure concerned is likely to be lost or destroyed if there is a delay in carrying out the procedure; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
           1. The police may use reasonable force to ensure that you comply with the order for the carrying out of the forensic procedure. 
           
          
          
           
           2. The police are required to comply with the provisions of Part 6 of [the Act] in carrying out the forensic procedure.” 
           
          
         
        
       
      
     This accurately reflects reasons given orally by the magistrate at the time he made the orders.3 An appeal lies to this Court against such an order only on a ground that involves a question of law alone, or, by the leave of this Court, on a question of fact or a question of mixed fact and law. 
     
      
    4 At the conclusion of the hearing of the appeal, and because there existed a degree of urgency, I dismissed the appeal. These are my reasons for doing so. 
     
      
    5 The long title of the Act explains its function. It includes: 
     
      
       
        
        “An Act to make provision with respect to the power to carry out forensic procedures on certain persons and to make provision with respect to a DNA database system …” 
        
       
      
    6 Part 5 of the Act is headed: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        Forensic procedures by order of Magistrate or other authorised Justice 
        ”. 
        
       
      
     The central provisions, at least for present purposes, are s24 and s25. By s24 (and by reference to s23) a magistrate is authorised to order the carrying out of the forensic procedure where a suspect has not consented, or by s8, cannot consent; and the magistrate is satisfied of the matters itemised in s25.7 “Forensic procedure” is, relevantly, defined in s3 of the Act to include the taking of a sample by buccal swab; it also includes, specifically as “non-intimate forensic procedure”, the taking of a hair sample (other than pubic hair); and the taking of photographs of parts of the body (with presently immaterial exceptions). “Intimate forensic procedure”, by s3, includes the taking of a sample of blood. 
     
      
    8 By s8 an “incapable person” cannot consent to a forensic procedure; “incapable person” is defined in s3 as meaning an adult who is incapable of understanding the general nature and effect of a forensic procedure, or is incapable of indicating whether he or she consents or does not consent to a forensic procedure being carried out. 
     
      
    9 S25 sets out the matters required to be considered by a magistrate before ordering a forensic procedure. It is convenient to set out the section in full: 
     
      
       
        
        “The Magistrate must be satisfied that: 
         
        (a) the person on whom the procedure is proposed to be carried out is a suspect, and 
         
        (b) if the forensic procedure concerned is an intimate forensic procedure, on the evidence before the Magistrate there are reasonable grounds to believe that the suspect committed: 
         
          
          (i) a prescribed offence, or 
           
          (ii) another prescribed offence arising out of the same circumstances as that offence, or 
           
          (iii) another prescribed offence in respect of which evidence likely to be obtained as a result of carrying out the procedure on the suspect is likely to have probative value, and 
          
         
        Note. A  
        prescribed offence 
         is defined in section 3 as an indictable offence or any other offence prescribed by the regulations. 
         
        (c) if the forensic procedure concerned is a non-intimate forensic procedure other than the taking of a sample of hair other than pubic hair, on the evidence before the Magistrate, there are reasonable grounds to believe that the suspect committed: 
         
          
          (i) an indictable or a summary offence, or 
           
          (ii) another indictable or summary offence arising out of the same circumstances as that offence, or 
           
          (iii) another indictable or summary offence in respect of which evidence likely to be obtained as a result of carrying out the procedure on the suspect is likely to have probative value, and 
          
         
        (d) if the forensic procedure concerned is the taking of a sample of hair other than pubic hair, on the evidence before the Magistrate, there are reasonable grounds to believe that the suspect committed: 
         
          
          (i) a prescribed offence, or 
           
          (ii) another prescribed offence arising out of the same circumstances as that offence, or 
           
          (iii) another prescribed offence in respect of which evidence likely to be obtained as a result of carrying out the procedure on the suspect is likely to have probative value, and 
          
         
        (e) if the forensic procedure concerned is the taking of a sample by buccal swab, on the evidence before the Magistrate, there are reasonable grounds to believe that the suspect committed: 
         
          
          (i) a prescribed offence, or 
           
          (ii) another prescribed offence arising out of the same circumstances as that offence, or 
           
          (iii) another prescribed offence in respect of which evidence likely to be obtained as a result of carrying out the procedure on the suspect is likely to have probative value, and 
          
         
        (f) there are reasonable grounds to believe that the forensic procedure might produce evidence tending to confirm or disprove that the suspect committed the relevant offence, and 
         
        (g) the carrying out of the forensic procedure is justified in all the circumstances.” 
        
       
      
    10 “Suspect” is defined in s3 to include: 
     
      
       
        
        “(a) a person whom a police officer suspects on reasonable grounds has committed an offence …”. 
        
       
      
    11 On 9 February 2007 Detective Senior Constable Nicole Zeitler (who later gave evidence under the name Nicole Borghouts) made an application under s24 of the Act for a final order authorising the carrying out of a forensic procedure on the plaintiff. The application did not specify the particular forensic procedure in relation to which she sought the order. 
     
      
    12 She supported her application by an affidavit, and some other documentary material. In the affidavit she identified the forensic procedures for which she sought orders as: 
     
      
       
        
        “Buccal swab 
         
        Hair sample 
         
        Photograph 
         
        Blood test (if suspect refuses above procedures).” 
        
       
      
    13 The effect of the evidentiary material was as follows. 
     
      
     In the early afternoon of 13 January 2007 the body of an 82 year old man, Mark Hutchinson, was found in the back yard of his home at 74 Markham Street Armidale. The body had been decapitated. The head was a short distance from the torso. Some human hair was located on the back of the shirt Mr Hutchinson was wearing. Some cigarettes were found at the scene.14 Inspection of the premises did not suggest robbery as a motive for the murder. There was no sign of forced entry to the house, and Mr Hutchinson’s wallet remained untouched in his rear pocket. Police are aware of no other motive for the murder. 
     
      
    15 A Mr David Green had been in the general vicinity the previous day, 12 January, at about 11.30 am. Mr Green saw a male person fitting the general description of the plaintiff jump the fence at 74 Markham Street and run across parkland to a nearby creek. 
     
      
    16 Mr Green described this person’s clothing as a dark-coloured long-sleeved top, possibly tracksuit, and dark coloured long pants, also possibly tracksuit. 
     
      
    17 Police also had reports of “numerous sightings” of a male on Rusden Street (which, later references showed, intersects with Markham Street) on 13 January. Some of these positively identified the plaintiff as the person. The description of the clothing he was then wearing was similar to that given by Mr Green of the clothing worn by the man he had seen the previous day. A significant addition to the clothing description was that the man seen on 13 January was wearing a cap described as “similar to a police cap”. 
     
      
    18 On 17 January the plaintiff was detained by police. He was wearing clothes which fitted Mr Green’s description of the clothes worn by the man he had observed, and “a dark blue/black cap”. He was in possession of a pair of “fake handcuffs with a key and a butter knife”. While he was in custody investigators noticed a high concentration of silvery-grey/white fibres on his socks. Subsequently, investigators discovered, near Mr Hutchinson’s home, a clump of a plant, perhaps Patterson’s Curse, that had similar fibres. Patterson’s Curse is a plant which is not common in the area. One broken off plant was found in the area where Mr Green saw the person leave 74 Markham Street on 12 January. 
     
      
    19 The plaintiff’s hair is, in length and colour, consistent with that found on Mr Hutchinson’s shirt. 
     
      
    20 The plaintiff’s mother lives in the near vicinity of Markham Street. The plaintiff has, on a previous occasion, given 1/75 Markham Street as his address, although there is, in fact, no such address. 
     
      
    21 The plaintiff was, after his apprehension, psychiatrically examined and, pursuant to the Mental Health Act 1990, found to be a mentally ill person; he was diagnosed as suffering from chronic schizophrenia. Although the precise nature of any order then made under the Mental Health Act does not emerge from the evidence, it is apparent that he was the subject of compulsory treatment orders under that Act. 
     
      
    22 [deleted] 
     
      
    23 Extensive medical records describe some of his history. These include many instances of the use of dangerous objects, threats of harm to others, aggressive and even homicidal thoughts towards various individuals. Most recently, in May 2006 he was found waving an axe at passing cars and passers-by, and in December 2006 to be loitering in the vicinity of school premises carrying scissors, a needle, with a tomahawk on the ground nearby. 
     
      
    24 A very large bundle of documents, containing drawings and writings by the plaintiff, was part of the material in evidence. This included a drawing of a headless torso; a reference to “Jack the Ripper”; a drawing of a hand ashing a cigarette; another depiction of a body with the head separated; an item which reads “by removing his head and then his Tom Thumb will be exposed”; and much, much more that would require an expert to analyse. 
     
      
    25 The medical records also showed that the plaintiff had been a long-term patient of the New England Area Health Service. He was admitted to a facility called Banksia House on 16 December 2006, although it is not clearly disclosed whether this was a voluntary or involuntary admission. In respect of this admission the nursing progress notes are extensive and comprehensive. They show that, at 6.30 pm on 7 January 2007 the plaintiff was unable to be located. Security and police were notified. The notes also record that, at 8.00 pm that evening, he had been seen by police but that police were unable to apprehend him. He remained “AWOL” until readmitted following his apprehension on 17 January. 
     
      
    26 Reports of the murder appeared in the media. Representatives of Banksia House contacted police to express their concern that the plaintiff, who was then still at large, may have been the perpetrator. 
     
      
    27 Investigators believe that DNA examination of the hairs found on Mr Hutchinson’s shirt, the cigarettes found at the scene, a wrist watch worn by Mr Hutchinson, and the plaintiff’s clothing, may provide evidence that suggests or establishes his presence at Markham Street on 12 or 13 January. 
     
      
    28 Detective Borghouts gave oral evidence and was cross examined. She expanded to some extent on her affidavit evidence; she said that the plaintiff’s shoes, which had been seized on his apprehension on 17 January, bore red staining, and that preliminary testing was “presumptive for blood”. 
     
      
    29 Detective Borghouts was also cross examined to suggest that her affidavit evidence, concerning the timing of the contact by Banksia House staff expressing concern about the plaintiff may have been inaccurate. 
     
      
    30 It is unnecessary to conduct a complete analysis of the requirements of the Act. That is because only two matters were challenged on behalf of the plaintiff. The first was the magistrate’s finding that reasonable grounds existed to suspect that the plaintiff had committed the murder; the second, that there were reasonable grounds to believe that the forensic procedure(s) might produce evidence tending to confirm or disprove that the plaintiff committed the offence. 
     
      
    31 In the circumstances of the present case, it was necessary for the Magistrate to be satisfied of the following matters: 
     
      
       
      (i) that the plaintiff was a suspect (that is, that a police officer suspected on reasonable grounds that the plaintiff had committed an offence – s25(a)); 
       
      (ii) that there were reasonable grounds to believe that the plaintiff had committed an indictable offence (in this case, murder – s25(c), (d) and (e)); 
       
      (iii) that there were reasonable grounds to believe that the forensic procedure might produce evidence tending to confirm or disprove that the plaintiff committed the offence (s25(f)); 
       
      (iv) that the carrying out of the forensic procedure was justified in all the circumstances (s25(g)). 
       
      
    32 In order to prove the first – that the plaintiff was a suspect - it was necessary that the police officer establish to the satisfaction of the magistrate that she did in fact suspect that the plaintiff had committed an offence. This she was able to do by her own assertion. It was also necessary to establish that her suspicion was based upon reasonable grounds. This could not be done by her own assertion. As I have previously observed (Orban v Bayliss [2004] NSWSC 428), it is not a sufficient discharge of the magistrate’s function merely to accept a police officer’s assertion that he or she has reasonable grounds for the stated belief. The magistrate must bring an independent assessment to bear upon the grounds said reasonably to give rise to that suspicion. There is, obviously, considerable overlap between that and the second matter necessary to be proved. 
     
      
    33 On the appeal, it was the first and third of the matters above that were the subject of challenge. Senior counsel who appeared for the plaintiff argued that the evidence was insufficient to satisfy the magistrate that Detective Borghouts had reasonable grounds for the suspicion that she asserted. She also argued that there was insufficient material to enable the magistrate to be satisfied that the forensic procedure(s) might produce evidence tending to confirm or disprove that the plaintiff committed the offence. 
     
      
    34 The magistrate declared himself to be satisfied of all of the matters of which he was required, by s25 of the Act, to be satisfied before making the order. S25A of the Act envisages some differences in what a magistrate is required to be satisfied of, depending upon whether the forensic procedure sought is an intimate forensic procedure, or a non-intimate forensic procedure. In fact, there are three categories – intimate, non-intimate, and buccal swabs. Although defined, the terms are largely self-explanatory. A non-intimate forensic procedure may be ordered where there are reasonable grounds to believe that the suspect has committed either an indictable or summary offence; and an intimate forensic procedure, or a buccal swab (or the taking of hair other than public hair) may be ordered only where there are reasonable grounds for believing that the suspect has committed a “prescribed” (relevantly, indictable) offence. Here, the difference is immaterial. The offence of which the plaintiff is suspected is the indictable offence of murder. 
     
      
    35 Analysis of the material put before the magistrate shows that, at this stage, the case for suspecting the plaintiff to be the perpetrator is circumstantial. However, there is, when the material is properly examined, a great deal of circumstantial material that would justify such a suspicion – that is, constitute reasonable grounds for the suspicion. 
     
      
    36 This included the description given by Mr Green of the person he had seen in the vicinity at the relevant time; the plant fibre on the plaintiff’s clothing, being similar to plant fibre in the vicinity of the crime; hairs found on Mr Hutchinson’s body that appeared to be consistent with the plaintiff’s hair; the plaintiff’s association with Markham Street or its vicinity; the writings and drawings of the plaintiff; medical evidence that the plaintiff had experienced homicidal ideation and thoughts; evidence of violence on the part of the plaintiff on previous occasions; the red staining on the plaintiff’s shoes which was presumptive for blood; previous occasions when the plaintiff had been known to carry cutting weapons. 
     
      
    37 On behalf of the defendant it was also pointed out that the evidence of the cap he was wearing (said to be similar to a police cap) when arrested on 17 January, and his possession of “fake” handcuffs on the later occasion could provide some link with the (unidentified) person seen in the vicinity of Markham Street on 13 January, also wearing a cap that could fit the description of a “police cap”. 
     
      
    38 Plainly, establishing reasonable grounds for a suspicion is a less demanding test than establishing reasonable grounds to charge a person with an offence. The whole purpose of the authorisation of forensic procedures is to provide evidence either to strengthen an existing suspicion, or to explode that suspicion. I am satisfied that there was ample material to justify Detective Borghout’s suspicion that the plaintiff was the perpetrator of the murder. 
     
      
    39 An attack was also made upon the finding that there were reasonable grounds to believe that the forensic procedures might produce appropriate evidence. There was sufficient evidence – for example, the hairs found on Mr Hutchinson’s shirt – that DNA material might be available from the crime scene. If the forensic procedures proposed yielded confirmation (or disproof) that that was the plaintiff’s DNA, that would be sufficient to establish reasonable grounds. 
     
      
    40 Accordingly, both challenges to the orders failed. I confirm that the appeal is dismissed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: The applicant, AEL, pleaded guilty at Wyong Children’s Court on 6 May 2003 to one count of sexual intercourse with a child beneath the age of 10. Three further matters of indecent assault upon another child under the age of 10 were included on a Form 1. At the time of the offences the applicant was aged no more than 13 years and possibly 12. The victims in each case were his siblings, his brother then aged about 8 and his sister aged about 5.  
     
      
    2 The sexual intercourse count was a breach of s 66A of the Crimes Act 1900 and at the time of the offence carried a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment. The matters on the Form 1 were breaches of s 61M(2) of the Act for which the maximum penalty is 10 years imprisonment. 
     
      
    3 The sentencing judge, correctly, determined that the offence contrary to s 66A was a serious children’s indictable offence and accordingly the applicant was required to be dealt with according to law (ss 3 and 17 Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 and Children Criminal Proceedings Regulation 2000 No 433 (repealed)). The contraventions of s 61M(2) are indictable offences which, pursuant to s 18 Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 may be dealt with according to law or in accordance with Division 4 of Part 3 of the Act. In the present case the matters were taken into account on a Form 1 pursuant to the procedure provided for in Division 3 of Part 3 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. 
     
      
    4 When the applicant first came before the sentencing judge on 18 August 2003 his Honour concluded that the primary focus of the Court must be on the applicant’s rehabilitation. His Honour also recognised the need to have regard to the protection of his sibling victims.  
     
      
    5 After the offences were originally discovered the applicant had been removed from his home and came under the care of the Department of Community Services. His Honour recognised that there had been conflicts between the Department of Community Services and the Department of Juvenile Justice in relation to the appropriate rehabilitation program for the applicant but at that stage concluded that the “proper sentencing option is for me to place the young person on a good behaviour bond.” His Honour determined that a condition of any bond should be that the applicant enter into the residential program conducted at Mirvac House, a residential rehabilitative unit for young people. Accordingly, his Honour determined to defer passing sentence upon the applicant entering into a good behaviour bond for the term of 3 years under the following conditions: 
     
      
       
        
        “That you enter the residential program conducted at Mirvac House, that you remain there as long as the requirements of that program dictate, that you cooperate fully with those who are there in charge of your treatment, education and counselling. 
        
       
       
        
        It is a further condition that upon your release you become subject to the supervision of the Department of Juvenile Justice and obey the directions of the officers of that Department. That supervision is to continue for as long as the Department of Juvenile Justice considers appropriate up to the full term of the bond and you will comply with the requirements of those officers concerning attendance at counselling or other therapeutic programs as may be required.” 
        
       
      
    6 As it happened the applicant was unable to complete his rehabilitative program at Mirvac House before funding was withdrawn by the Department of Community Services. The circumstances in which this funding was withdrawn are not clear but the sentencing judge found, in the subsequent sentencing hearing on 3 March 2006, that it was through no fault of the applicant. Upon his release from Mirvac House the applicant led “a very chequered career.” The sentencing judge said of his circumstances that he “bounced around the community, sometimes staying in recognised organisations which were in a position to and did offer him the prospect of assistance, sometimes staying in accommodation he organised for himself, for a time returning to his family home from which of course he had been expelled because of the nature of the offences he had committed against his siblings.” His Honour found that all of the accommodation had been temporary, most of it unsatisfactory and on a number of occasions “at least in a technical and often in a very practical sense, breached the conditions of his bond and his status as a now registered sexual offender.” 
     
      
    7 It was as a consequence of the breaches of his bond that the applicant came to be sentenced at a hearing which, as I have indicated, took place in March 2006. By this time the applicant was aged 16 and during the years since the original offences had displayed many and significant behavioural problems. Juvenile Justice had intended that after leaving Mirvac House the applicant would be treated by a psychiatrist specialising in children’s problems, but this did not occur. His Honour found that although the applicant was intelligent he was manipulative and suffered from an inability to control his anger. Notwithstanding a plea by the applicant’s counsel that his bond be further extended his Honour determined that a period of incarceration was necessary. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I have come regretfully to the conclusion that it is necessary to sentence him to a term of incarceration. I am still committed to the idea that his rehabilitation comes first and I find very special circumstances in his clear need for prolonged supervision in the community once he has been released. At the age of 16 he needs a lot of help. He needs to help himself. He needs to be brought to the realisation that that is what he must do.” 
        
       
      
    8 His Honour revoked the bond and sentenced the applicant to a non-parole period of 18 months with a further term of 3 years and 6 months. His Honour provided that the applicant would be eligible for parole on 2 September 2007 with his sentence expiring on 2 March 2011. 
     
      
       
      The facts 
       
      
    9 On 15 January 2003 5 year old CL and 8 year old AL each disclosed to their mother that the applicant had sexually assaulted them. The parents contacted the police. The facts before the sentencing judge disclosed that the applicant had penetrated his brother’s anus with his penis when his brother was aged between 7 and 8 years. This constituted the count on the indictment. The matters on the Form 1 were occasions when the applicant had placed his penis against his sister’s anus at various times when she was 5 years old. 
     
      
    10 The fact sheet which was tendered to his Honour indicated that the applicant had admitted committing the offences and accepted during an interview that while committing those offences he was aware that his actions were wrong. He said he could not prevent his behaviour and accepted that he needed assistance to address these problems. 
     
      
    11 The evidence before the sentencing judge disclosed the nature and extent of the applicant’s psychological problems. He is the eldest of 3 children and was born a healthy child. From an early age his parents observed that he adopted an unusual crouch position and rocked back and forth when sleeping. Concerned that he may be autistic his parents took him to various medical specialists for assessment but no definitive diagnosis was provided. However, it was thought that the applicant had Attention Deficit Disorder and he was prescribed Ritalin and Catapres at about pre-school age. His behaviour did not change. 
     
      
    12 As a child the applicant commonly engaged in screaming fits, hitting his head on walls, and kicking people who looked at him. His behaviour had restricted him from participating in team sports. 
     
      
    13 When assessed by a psychologist from the Juvenile Justice Sex Offender Program he was found to be articulate with a capacity to process information in an analytical manner. It was reported that he had been suspended from school for periods of time because of aggressive outbursts towards teachers. The psychologist concluded that his outbursts may be a response to anxiety when he found himself unable to handle a particular situation. He was found to have a negative response to frustration and quickly reacted in a verbally abusive manner. The psychologist concluded that the applicant had “significant problems suggesting that he was a person that was anxious and/or depressed, had attention problems, had significant delinquent and aggressive behaviour problems to a clinical degree.” The psychologist concluded that the applicant was probably not a delinquent person but “that a cluster of issues that (the applicant) identified as problems in his life had now reached a significant level, culminating with his removal from his home.” It was concluded that the applicant’s abusive behaviour “might be a dysfunctional coping response to the problems that (the applicant) has encountered.” 
     
      
    14 A number of recommendations were made with an overarching recommendation that he be supervised and guided by staff of the Department of Juvenile Justice. 
     
      
       
      The appeal 
       
      
    15 The applicant submitted that the sentence imposed in March 2006 was excessive. In my opinion that submission should be accepted. 
     
      
    16 In written submissions prepared on the applicant’s behalf counsel acknowledged that there was a lack of decided cases from which a pattern of sentencing for the instant offences could be determined. There are too few like cases to establish a relevant sentencing pattern. 
     
      
    17 In R v KLH (2004) 148 A Crim R 515; NSWCCA 312 a young boy aged 13 at the time of the offence was convicted following trial on three counts of sexual intercourse with a child aged 7. There were three offences relating to the same victim with whom the offender was sharing a bedroom on a sleep-over. The first occasion was of fellatio, the second penile/anal intercourse and the third another act of fellatio. The resulting sentences imposed a minimum term of full-time custody of 3 years and a total sentence of 5½ years. There was evidence before the Court that at the time of the offences the offender had many substantial physical handicaps which had occasioned him social difficulties. By the time of sentence he had been assessed as having a low risk of potential future offending and there was evidence that he no longer represented a threat to the community.  
     
      
    18 An appeal to this Court was upheld and a sentence comprising a minimum term of 1 year and an overall sentence of 2 years was substituted. 
     
      
    19 The applicant accepted that in his case this Court could not conclude that at the time he was sentenced in August 2006 he was not a future risk to the community. However, it was submitted that a characteristic of his behaviour by this time was general unruliness. Importantly the applicant emphasised that there was no evidence of any further deviant sexual behaviour. Furthermore, there was no suggestion that the applicant’s behaviour at Mirvac House had been inappropriate or had led to his removal from the program. 
     
      
    20 In R v JDB (2005) 153 A Crim R 164; NSWCCA 102 this Court considered an appeal in respect of a young male aged 13 at the time of the offences. His offences involved sexual assaults upon his half-sister who was 8 years old at the time. He was sentenced to a non-parole period of 12 months imprisonment with a balance of term of 2 years. This Court upheld an appeal and reduced the sentence to a non-parole period of approximately 8 months with a total sentence of 3 years. 
     
      
    21 In R v KBM [2004] NSWCCA 123 this Court considered an appeal with respect to an offence committed by a 13 year old boy who forced a 9 year old girl to fellate him. The sentencing judge imposed a non-parole period of 12 months with an overall term of 3 years. This Court upheld an appeal and reduced the non-parole period to 5 months with an overall term of 3 years. 
     
      
    22 Although it may be accepted that from these decisions a definitive sentencing pattern cannot be determined – there are simply not enough decisions – the sentence which was imposed on the applicant was significantly greater than any sentence imposed for similar offences of which this Court is aware. The Crown accepted that the sentence was high. In my opinion it was excessively so. 
     
      
    23 This case presents peculiar difficulties. When the sentencing judge first imposed a bond the applicant apparently performed satisfactorily and was making progress in Mirvac House. There is nothing to suggest that if he had been able to continue in that program he would not have achieved a successful outcome. It is a matter of great regret that his residency was terminated through no fault of his own. 
     
      
    24 Being without the support of Mirvac House his behaviour deteriorated and it was necessary for him to be dealt with as a person who had committed many breaches of the conditions of his bond. However, in my view, an appropriate sentence would have provided for a continuation of a program involving close supervision of the applicant with attention being given to his development so that he could ultimately function as a responsible member of the community. The sentence which his Honour imposed did not meet this objective.  
     
      
       
      Resentencing 
       
      
    25 The applicant tendered on this appeal reports from Dr Bath, a clinical psychologist working with child sex offenders and an accredited counsellor under the scheme operated by the NSW Commission for Children and Young People. In the event that this Court believed it necessary to resentence the Crown takes no objection to the Court considering these reports. I am satisfied that in the unusual circumstances of this case the reports should be admitted into evidence.  
     
      
    26 Dr Bath reports on the progress which the applicant made in Mirvac House including his progress at school where he began to experience academic success. Apparently Dr Bath personally resisted the withdrawal of the applicant from the program entitled “New Pathways Program” which he was then undertaking. There can be no question that the opposition of Dr Bath and some of his colleagues to the applicant’s removal from the program was justified. The fears which they held as to the applicant’s likely future behaviour if he was removed unfortunately materialised. 
     
      
    27 Dr Bath is of the opinion that the complex pattern of behaviour of the applicant is indicative of an autistic spectrum disorder (ASD). He has problems around non verbal communication, failure to develop peer relationships and lacks social and emotional reciprocity. He has poor fine and gross motor skills, sensory abnormalities, rigid thinking patterns with explosiveness, an early focus on transport themes (trains), problems around motivation, unusual memory skills, and speech abnormalities. Dr Bath believes that he may have a narcissistic personality. 
     
      
    28 Dr Bath indicated that people with ASD have difficulties: 
     
      
    · Understanding the impact of their behaviour on others· Reading and responding to non verbal cues (such as indications of distress) · Understanding social context (eg issues of age differences, roles etc) unless it has been explicitly explained or pointed out. For example, for most people the social context of pornography (paid actors, willing participants, all adults, its fringe status) is picked up intuitively. People with ASD do not intuitively pick up the unspoken rules of social transactions and can mimic the behaviours they see out of context· Translating abstract principles (such as empathy, responsibility, respect) into specific behaviours – they tend to make sense of human transactions by means of rigid, idiosyncractic rules rather than principles· Weighing up and working through consequences and adjusting behaviours accordingly (one of the so-called executive functions that requires what has been termed “working memory”)· Mentalising in general, for example, being able to work through a fantasy in their minds without the need to touch or see for something to become ‘real’ to them 
     
      
    29 Dr Bath’s research indicates that “research into the behavioural difficulties of people with ASD is in its infancy.” However, he believes that for someone like the applicant the following intervention principles would apply: 
     
      
       
        
        “1. He needs a clear social structure in which to operate, where the rules and expectations are explicit, where socially appropriate behaviours are rewarded and where, if necessary, realistic, mildly-adversive sanctions apply. Supervision orders can be designed to address some of these needs. For (AEL), a supervision framework that encourages and supports him to attend school and to develop his cognitive strengths and interests is imperative. His cognitive abilities (including reading, comprehension, knowledge retention) are amongst his greatest strengths and these need to be nurtured. Clear guidelines, expectations and practical support around his living circumstances are also needed as it is apparent that he yet lacks the maturity and wisdom to find stable living options and to maintain a stable friendship group. 
         
         
        2. He needs a sound support structure in place where there are people he trusts and to whom he can turn when he needs help. It has been observed that people with ASD have difficulties generalising learning and therefore need ongoing social coaching to help them interpret situations and respond appropriately to social demands. This is in contrast to learning that relies on the application of adverse (painful) consequences that are applied after problems occur. Asperger himself observed that with such young people all learning has to proceed via the intellect. 
         
         
        3. Formal intervention relating to sexual offending behaviours needs to focus on rules to maintain safe, non abusive social interaction, time accountability and realistic supervision and monitoring, along with positive social coaching. Insight-related approaches or those that focus on abstract principles such as empathy or respect are less likely to be effective. 
         
         
        4. Those who work with (AEL) will need to understand that he needs focused help on translating cognitive knowledge into behaviour and to “teach for meaning” rather than knowledge per se; that he will need longer to process information; that he will learn better using both visual and auditory modalities rather than “talk therapy” alone; that traditional cognitive-behavioural approaches will not be effective (given their reliance on mentalising and working memory); and that group-based interventions are likely to be problematic. Computer-based learning, and the use of a laptop computer to keep notes would be useful for (AEL) given his manifest difficulties with hand writing and hand-eye coordination. 
         
         
        5. As with most treatment approaches, it is ultimately more beneficial and motivating to focus energies on what is referred to as developing a “good life” (ie one that leads to the development of realistic life goals, sound work practices, safe parenting roles, supportive friendships, positive habits etc) than to focus on the suppression of inappropriate thoughts and behaviours. Focusing on developing (AEL)’s cognitive and verbal strengths is one aspect of this ‘strength-based’ approach.” 
        
       
      
    30 In a further report Dr Bath expressed detailed views as to the appropriate treatment and supervision of the applicant in the future. He said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Background: (AEL) who is 16 years of age, is currently serving a sentence for the sexual abuse of his younger siblings which occurred when he was 12 years of age and younger. As outlined in the earlier report, young people with ASD's appear to be at risk of engaging in inappropriate sexual behaviours (and a number of other challenging behaviours) for a number of reasons that are related to their condition, including the fact that they have an impaired empathic capacity, they tend to be egocentric, they have difficulty reading nonverbal communications (such as facial expressions), and they have difficulty considering and weighing up the consequences of decisions. They also tend to choose behaviours and repeat them on the basis of the salience (effect, impact) rather than social significance. Thus, if it feels good, provides a sense of power or control, or is effective, the behaviour is more likely to be repeated - the social meaning or significance of the behaviours tends to be overlooked. Addressing the question of why and what should happen: 
        
       
       
        
        1. (AEL) would be best placed in a situation in which there is a good understanding of his personality style and day-to-day coaching (and if possible, group work) is available to him to help him learn about and understand normal social expectations and behaviours. Such a placement was provided during his time at Mirvac House (now New Pathways) in the Southern Highlands where, after a few difficult months, he settled into the program and made good social and academic gains. (AEL) has a history of getting into conflict with his peers and he needs both coaching around social skills and protection from the peer aggression that he sometimes tends to provoke. 
        
       
       
        
        2. He needs clear structure in terms of daily programming and expectations, and a reasonable amount of supervision and accountability. He probably receives this in the detention facility, but it is a regimented, controlled environment that does little to enhance his ability to make safe and appropriate social choices and to learn from these. In the months prior to his incarceration when he had little clear daily structure and accountability, (AEL) was experiencing a great deal of social difficulty, making rash and inappropriate decisions and getting into conflicts with peers. Any program into which (AEL) is placed will need to have a well-developed, clearly articulated model of care, an emphasis on daily and weekly timetabling, a case management program that addresses a range of social, familial, therapeutic and recreational needs, and a requirement that he attends school or work, keeps the program rules, and makes acceptable progress. 
        
       
       
        
        3. A program to address (AEL)'s therapeutic needs will also need to be in place as suggested below in (b). 
        
       
       
        
        4. It is likely that (AEL) will always benefit from some level of social coaching as people with his pattern of behaviour often find the generalisation of learning to new settings to be particularly difficult. It is unlikely that he would be able to stay more than a year in the highly-structured program recommended in 2 for an extended period of time so it would be helpful if such a program could gradually provide him with more independence as he learns to take responsibility and to make wise decisions. Ideally, he would move on to a less supervised and structured setting (operated by the same organisation) which would maintain some level of supervision and support. 
        
       
       
        
        5. Some level of statutory supervision would be of benefit to (AEL). He is likely to need such external accountability to help keep him focused on his commitment to his schooling and the new program as well as his statutory obligations. 
        
       
       
        
        (b) (AEL)'s therapy issues, especially in the future 
        
       
       
        
        (AEL) was placed in the Mirvac House program for over a year. During this time he made substantial progress with respect to his social skills, his schooling, and his therapeutic needs. For example, he made good progress in covering the exercises in his workbooks around sexual offending and participated in the other exercises that were required by program participants. His progress was slower in achieving improvements in his social interactions with peers although even here, significant progress was achieved overtime. 
        
       
       
        
        In terms of the risk that he may pose to children, the recent assessment reports suggest that this significantly lower than a few years ago. He does not appear to have a significant problem around deviant fantasy patterns involving children (these appear to be age appropriate) and his offences were essentially opportunistic, taking advantage of the proximity and vulnerability of his siblings. He has also learnt a great deal about his particular pattern of offending and structuring for safety. The risk that (AEL) carries pertains mainly to what are termed `static' factors - those that have to do with the historical facts of his background and offence history. Keeping a strong focus on sexually-specific issues is likely to be iatrogenic and to risk giving him a perception of himself as a sexual offender. This carries a danger that he will eventually act out the expectation. He will, however, benefit from periodic reminders and reviews of his safety plan. 
        
       
       
        
        Although his counsellor/s will need to be aware of potential risks around sexual behaviours, the focus of any direct therapeutic intervention should be on his social and emotional adjustment, and particularly on assisting him to relate with others successfully and on developing his positive attributes and talents. This is consistent with the current emphasis of sex offender treatment in which so-called `approach' goals are emphasised such as developing positive attitudes and ethics, working out employment and training goals, and strengthening social support networks. This is sometimes referred to as the ""Good Lives"" focus (Ward, 2000) and contrasts with an exclusive focus on so-called `avoidance' goals such as suppressing negative thoughts and attitudes. 
        
       
       
        
        (c & d) Possible future case supervisor and possible program 
        
       
       
        
        These two items are linked as the choice of counsellor will depend on where and with whom (AEL) will be living. It is unrealistic to think that (AEL) may be able to return to the family home. Both (AEL) and his parents accept that this will not be possible. He will need to go to a structured residential program that meets the requirements for structure and programming outlined above. The only realistic possibility I can see at this point is a Youth Off The Streets (YOTS) program, either in Sydney or the Southern Highlands of NSW. I have been in contact with YOTS and they state that they are willing to consider accepting (AEL) into one of their programs in the Southern Highlands. They will need to speak with him first to establish whether he wants to go and will commit to keeping the rules and any probation conditions that are set for him. I understand that Ms McKay is currently arranging to visit (AEL) to assess whether they can formally offer him a place. 
        
       
       
        
        Funding for such a program will need to be obtained. Normally such funding is provided by either the Department of Community Services or the Department of Juvenile Justice. The former is unlikely to contribute as they withdrew their funding some time ago and do not consider there to be a current child protection concern that warrant's their involvement. It is uncertain whether the Department of Juvenile Justice will consider funding (AEL)'s placement at YOTS. If these two funding sources fail an appeal might be lodged with Fr Chris Riley (CEO of YOTS) who may still consider taking (AEL) as he has been a past client of the organisation. 
        
       
       
        
        If YOTS is able to accommodate (AEL), I would recommend that he reside in a more structured facility for a year (or the best part of a year) whilst he attends school, TAFE or a combination of these, as some young people are currently doing. Foundation House, one of the YOTS facilities in the Southern Highlands has a few young people who are currently in year 11 and who intend to complete their year 12. The case plan should incorporate the need for moving (AEL) into a less supervised setting after the initial year and/or when he has demonstrated a marked improvement in his ability to safely manage his social relationships and has achieved stability around work or education. 
        
       
       
        
        I would recommend that a senior caseworker of the organisation in which he is placed take on the role of case supervisor for the period of time that he is with them - this is likely to be the case if he is accepted into a YOTS facility. He should also be allocated a counsellor from within the organisation to undertake a formal counselling program based on his broader adjustment as well as the offence-specific needs as outlined in the previous report. This counsellor should either be accredited or receive regular supervision from an accredited sex offender counsellor. 
        
       
       
        
        In addition to any such arrangements that are made, the structure provided by statutory supervision would also be beneficial for (AEL). I would recommend that any bond conditions specify the living situation to which (AEL) should be moved; the type of program that should be offered (as outlined above); the length of time he should be in this program; the expectations (in terms of education/work and cooperation); and other normal statutory accountability requirements.” 
        
       
      
    31 The offence which the applicant committed and the matters on the Form 1 were serious. However they should be understood as aberrant behaviour engaged in by a troubled boy in early adolescence. There is no suggestion that since the offences were committed the applicant has engaged in any deviant sexual behaviour although he has experienced great difficulty adjusting to his circumstances. This is not surprising given that he started life with significant handicaps and, once his offending was identified, an appropriate regime for his care could not be established. I do not diminish the potential impact of his offending upon his siblings and the likely impact on the whole of the family. Although the sentencing judge had no alternative but to deal with him according to law, the breaches of his original bond should be accepted as a product of the failure in the community to effectively respond to his problems. 
     
      
    32 It may be that the sentencing judge was not provided with evidence of the true nature of the applicant’s condition. He was also not provided with evidence of an effective plan for the care and ongoing rehabilitation of the applicant. That position has changed in this Court.  
     
      
    33 Evidence from an officer of the Department of Juvenile Justice was tendered on the appeal. This indicates that if the applicant is released to parole he will be able to be accommodated, without cost, in the Youth Off the Streets Program for a period of 12 months with a view to him thereafter moving into independent residential accommodation. His placement will be conditional on his continuing appropriate behaviour. I understand that this opportunity will provide the applicant with access to the discipline, guidance, education and care which he clearly needs if he is to take his place as a responsible member of the community. In my opinion in resentencing the applicant the orders of the court should condition his parole so that he resides at Youth Off the Streets. A condition should also be imposed that he attends sex offending counselling as directed by the Department of Juvenile Justice. 
     
      
    34 There is evidence before this Court which indicates that his period of incarceration may have jolted the applicant into a realisation of the need to address his aberrant behaviour and take responsibility for his actions. If further progress is to be made the applicant’s period of incarceration should now be brought to an end. A further condition of his parole must be that he accept the supervision of the Department of Juvenile Justice until the end of his parole period, which in my view should be on his 19th birthday. 
     
      
       
      Orders 
       
      
    35 In my view the appropriate orders: 
     
      
       
      1. Grant leave to appeal and uphold the appeal. 
       
      2. The sentence imposed on 3 March 2006 is quashed. 
       
      3. The applicant is sentenced to a non-parole period commencing on 3 March 2006 and expiring today with a further term expiring on 16 December 2008 (being the applicant’s 19th birthday). 
       
      4. I direct the applicant’s release to parole as soon as arrangements can be made for his accommodation in the Youth off the Streets Program. It is a condition of his parole that he accept the direction and supervision of the Department of Juvenile Justice including any direction as to his accommodation until the end of his parole period.

      BARR J 
      : The applicant, whom I shall call DFS, seeks leave to appeal against sentences imposed in the District Court. Having pleaded guilty in the Children’s Court the applicant was committed to the District Court for sentence. It was convenient for the Crown to restate the several charges and two Indictments were presented, each accompanied by a schedule under the provisions of s32  
      Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 
      . The first Indictment was as follows -  
       
        
         
          
          (1) On or about 30 May 2004 at Cooks Hill the applicant stole a motor vehicle namely a Nissan Coupe XIP 909 the property of Scott McKenzie. 
           
           
          (2) On 31 May 2004 at Warners Bay the applicant broke and entered the BP Service Station at Warners Bay and committed a serious indictable offence therein namely stole cigarettes, money and food the property of BP Service Station, in circumstances of aggravation, namely that he was in company with other persons. 
           
           
          (3) On 31 May 2004 at Adamstown the applicant while in company with other persons, assaulted Donna Parkinson with the intent to take a motor vehicle Subaru WRX AFC 39P, and took and drove it without the consent of the owner Janine Rowland. 
           
           
          (4) On 31 May 2004 at Tuggerah the applicant broke and entered `Footlocker' at Westfield Tuggerah Shopping Centre and committed a serious indictable offence therein namely he stole clothing and shoes the property of Footlocker Pty Ltd, in circumstances of aggravation, namely that he was in company with Kirk Crossley and Jarred Brown. 
          
         
         
          
          (5) On 31 May 2004 at Edgeworth Kirk Crossley and 
            
          Jarred Brown robbed Katherine Slarks of certain property namely a handbag and its contents and the applicant knowing that they had committed that offence received and assisted them. 
          
         
         
          
          (6) On 31 May 2004 at Cardiff the applicant broke and entered the Bogas Service Station and committed a serious indictable offence therein namely stole a quantity of cash, cigarettes and a briefcase the property of Bogas Service Station in circumstances of aggravation namely that he was in company with Kirk Crossley and Jarred Brown. 
           
           
          (7) On 31 May 2004 at Cardiff Kirk Crossley and Jarred Brown demanded money from Christopher Carroll with the intent to steal that property from Christopher Carroll and the applicant knowing they had committed that offence received and assisted them.  
          
         
        
       
       
      3 The schedule accompanying the first Indictment listed three offences to be taken into account under the third count, the “ 
      carjacking 
      ” count, as it was called. The offences may be summarised thus -  
       
        
         
          
          (i) on 30 May 2004 the applicant deliberately drove the stolen Subaru into the car of a security guard at the Mater Hospital, reversed and rammed the guard’s vehicle a second time;

          (5) On 5 July 2004 at Kariong the applicant assaulted Mitchel Walsh a law enforcement officer, not being a police officer, while in the execution of the officer's duty. 
           
           
          (6) On 2 September 2004 at Kariong the applicant assaulted Erik Anthony Hansen a law enforcement officer, not being a police officer, while in the execution of the officer's duty and by the assault occasioned actual bodily harm.

          (8) On 18 September 2004 at Kariong the applicant assaulted Dominic Pedavoli a law enforcement officer, not being a police officer, while in the execution of the officer's duty. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (9) On 18 September 2004 at Kariong the applicant maliciously damaged a refrigerator, stove, lounge suites and telephone the property of Kariong Juvenile Justice Centre. 
           
          
         
        
        
       
      5 The schedule accompanying the second Indictment summarised thus an offence to be taken into account in sentencing for the eighth count -  
       
        
         
          
          On 18 September 2004 the applicant and another young person, while secured in a part of the Juvenile Justice Centre where they were being kept, began to damage property. Staff sought to intervene. The applicant wielded a steel pole, striking the shields and helmets used by those members of the staff and putting them in fear.  
          
         
        
       
      6 Coolahan DCJ sentenced the applicant as follows on the first Indictment -

      9 During the events giving rise to the charges in the first Indictment the applicant was in the company of two other young men, Jarred Brown and Kirk Crossley. His Honour summarised the facts as follows -  
       
        
         
          
          On the evening of 30 May, Brown, together with Crossley and  
          (the applicant) 
          , were driving around in  
          (the applicant’s) 
           vehicle. At about 11.30pm they went to the Newcastle Mater hospital car park where they decided to steal a blue commodore sedan, registered number PUB-485. It had distinctive mag wheels. The vehicle had been parked in the car park earlier by the owner Mr Gary Agnew, who had driven to the hospital suffering from pneumonia. CCTV surveillance shows the boom gate of the car park being forced open and the Commodore being driven out. The mag wheels from the commodore were transferred to  
          (the applicant’s) 
           vehicle and the wheels from  
          (the applicant’s) 
           vehicle were put on the Commodore. All offenders then got into the Commodore, leaving  
          (the applicant’s) 
           vehicle in the car park. They drove the Commodore to the corner of Darby and Parry Streets, Cooks Hill, where it was set alight and destroyed. 
           
           
          These offences are contained in schedules relating to Brown and Crossley. For reasons that are unclear, it appears that  
          (the applicant) 
           was not charged in relation to stealing or the burning of the Commodore. 
           
           
          Having set fire to the Commodore, the offenders came upon a Nissan Silvia, registered number XIP-909, which was parked at the intersection of Darby and Parry Streets, Cooks Hill. It had been parked there earlier that day by Amy McKenzie, the daughter of the owner, Scott McKenzie. The offenders stole the Nissan Silvia by entering it and  
          (the applicant) 
           using a screwdriver to start it. This was in the early hours of the morning of 31 May 2004. [Count 1 on the first indictment] 
           
           
          The offence is set out on a schedule in the case of Brown but, in the case of both Crossley and  
          (the applicant) 
          , is represented by the first count in their respective indictments. The offence of car stealing pursuant to section 154 AA of the Act carries a maximum penalty of ten years imprisonment. 
           
           
          The offenders drove around in the Nissan Silvia until they came to Islington, where they saw a green Holden Astra, registered number AED-71B, parked in the driveway of the owner's home. One of the offenders smashed the driver's window in an attempt to steal the vehicle, but a neighbour was alerted and the offenders ran off 
          , 
            
          driving away in the Nissan Silvia. The attempted stealing of this vehicle is contained in schedules resalting to Brown and Crossley, but again it would appear that  
          (the applicant) 
           was not charged with any offence arising out of this incident. 
           
           
          At about 2.15 pm on 31 May 2004, the glass doors of the BP Service Station at Warners Bay were kicked in.  
          (The applicant) 
           later told investigating police that he had driven the Nissan Silvia to the service station and that the other offenders got out and broke into it. Approximately $100 in coins, $500 in cash and cigarettes to the value of $4,000 were taken. These offences are contained in schedules relating to Brown and Crossley. The activity forms the basis of count 2 in  
          (the applicant’s) 
           first indictment, that being a charge of aggravated break, enter and steal which, pursuant to section 112(2) of the Act, carries a maximum penalty of twenty years imprisonment and attracts a standard non-parole period of five years imprisonment. [Count 2 on the first indictment] 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Having committed this offence, the offenders continued to drive around in the Nissan Silvia. 
           
           
          At about 3.00am on 31 May 2004, Janine Rowland and Donna Parkinson were sitting in a Subaru WRX sedan, registered AFC-39P, which was parked on the eastern side of Date Street, near the intersection of Glebe Road and Adamstown. The vehicle belonged to Ms Rowland, who was in the driver's seat. Ms Parkinson was in the passenger's seat. 
           
           
          As the offenders were driving around, they were looking for a car that had more horsepower. As Ms Parkinson was about to alight the vehicle, the offenders came upon it and decided that this was the type of vehicle they were after. The offenders stopped and got out of their vehicle. Brown was armed with a shifting spanner, which was about one foot in length. He approached the driver's side of the Subaru WRX. Crossley approached the passenger side of the vehicle. 
           
           
          Crossley jumped on the bonnet of the vehicle, leering through the windscreen at the two women inside. By this time the women had locked their doors, Crossley jumped off the bonnet of the car and began attempting to kick the passenger side window in. Brown hit the driver's side of the vehicle with a shifting spanner until it smashed. The door was then unlocked and opened. 
          
         
        
        
         
          
          Brown dragged Ms Rowland from the vehicle and she fell to the roadway. Her handbag was stolen. Brown got into the car and unlocked the passenger's side door. Crossley then dragged  
          Ms  
          Parkinson from the vehicle and knocked her to the ground. Her handbag was stolen. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Brown then got into the back seat and the other two offenders got into the front seat of the vehicle. The vehicle was then driven away. 
           
           
          In the case of Brown these events give rise to counts 3 and 4 on his indictment.... The events also give rise to matters contained in one of the schedules. The events form the basis of counts 2 and 3 on Crossley's indictment... There is also a further offence arising out of these matters which is contained in Crossely's schedule. 
           
           
          The events also give rise to count 3 in  
          (the applicant’s) 
           first indictment, that being a count of aggravated car jacking which, when dealt with according to law... carries a maximum penalty of fourteen years imprisonment and which attracts a standard non-parole period of five years imprisonment. [Count 3 on the first indictment] 
           
           
          As result of these offences, both Ms Rowland and Ms Parkinson sustained some injuries, as well as very significant emotional sequelae… 
           
           
          Shortly after the car jacking of Ms Rowland's Subaru WRX, the Nissan Silvia was taken to Fowler Street, Hamilton South, where it was set alight and destroyed. This activity gives rise to offences contained in schedules in the case of Brown and Crossley, although it would appear that  
          (the applicant) 
           was not charged with any offence arising out of that activity. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          The stolen Subaru WRX was then driven to the Tuggerah Westfield Shopping Centre, where Brown had earlier left the stolen Ford station wagon, UEH-798. At about 4.15 am on 31 May 2004 Crossley drove that vehicle... the Ford station wagon, into the doors sealing the shopping centre complex and, as a result, extensive damage was occasioned. That car was closely followed by the stolen Subaru WRX. The Ford station wagon was driven though the front door of the Foot Locker store within the shopping complex, allowing the offenders to gain access thereto. The offenders entered the store and grabbed armfuls of clothing, hats, sports shoes and other small items. These were loaded into the Subaru WRX. Just over $10,000 worth of stock was stolen from the store. 
           
           
          As the offenders left the scene, the Ford station wagon sideswiped a flower shop, with damage being occasioned to the premises. This vehicle was then dumped. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          These events give rise to count 5 in Brown's indictment... to count 4 in Crossley's indictment...and count 4 on the applicant's first indictment- which is a charge of aggravated break enter and steal , carrying a maximum penalty of twenty years imprisonment and attracting a standard non parole period of five years imprisonment. [Count 4 on the first indictment] 
           
           
          At about 5.20am that morning, Catherine Slarks attended the Andrew Nash Medical Clinic at 7 Arnott Street, Edgeworth, to begin work as a cleaner. After parking her car, Ms Slarks approached the clinic. She was carrying her bag on her right shoulder. She noticed two men in the car park area walking towards her. She began to run towards the main road. As she ran, she noticed a third man under the security spotlight about thirty metres away. She began screaming. She was pulled from behind, causing her to fall. She landed on her back and head. The two men whom she had earlier seen were now standing over her. One of the men ripped the bag from her shoulder and the two men fled and joined the third man. It was Brown and Crossley who knocked Ms Slarks to the ground and took her bag. The identity of the third person is not known. Ms Slark's handbag contained cash, a mobile phone and other personal items, including her purse. 
           
           
          These events give rise to count 6 on Brown's indictment, that being a charge of robbery in company... count 5 on Crossley's indictment, being an identical charge ...count 5 on  
          (the applicant’s) 
           first indictment, that being a charge of being an accessory after the fact of robbery in company, which carries a maximum penalty of fourteen years imprisonment. [Count 5 on the first indictment] 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          After robbing Ms Slarks, the offenders drove to the Bogas Service Station at Warners Bay. At about 5.30am, Mr Christopher Carroll, the owner of the business, was opening up. He unlocked and opened the shop, re-locking the front doors, and went around to the side of the building to open up the toilets. Whilst he was doing so he heard a car come into the service station. It was the stolen Subaru WRX. 
           
           
          The offenders got out of the vehicle and Crossley approached Carroll, punching him in the face hard enough to break his nose and knock him to the ground. Crossley demanded that Mr Carroll access the safe and threatened him with being shot, although it is conceded that the offenders did not actually possess a firearm. However, Mr Carroll saw the shape of the shifting spanner, which he thought may have been a gun. He was also threatened with being stabbed with a syringe if he tried to run away. It was brown who made the threats to shoot and stab Mr Carroll. 
           
           
          Mr Carroll was dragged to his feet; however, he saw an opportunity to escape and jumped over a fence and ran away. He was able to flag a passing car, the driver of which phoned the police. In the meantime, the offenders kicked in the front of the service station shop windows and stole cash and cigarettes and Mr Carroll's brief case. They decamped in the stolen Subaru WRX. 
           
           
          These events give rise to counts 7 and 8 on Brown's indictment and 6 and 7 on Crossley's indictment. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          The events give rise to counts 6 and 7 on  
          (the applicant’s) 
           first indictment, they being offences of aggravated break enter and steal (which carries a maximum penalty of twenty years imprisonment and attracts a standard non parole period of five years.) and an offence of being accessory after the fact to demanding money with intent to steal in company, which latter offence carries a maximum penalty  
          of  
          five years imprisonment. [Counts 6 and 7 on the first indictment] 
           
           
          The stolen Subaru WRX was then driven to the vicinity of the Mater Hospital, where  
          (the applicant) 
           had earlier parked his own car. Here the clothes, shoes and other items stolen from the Foot Locker store, along with the handbags stolen earlier that morning, were transferred to  
          (the applicant’s) 
           vehicle. Whilst this was happening, a security guard from the hospital, Aaron Roapati, was patrolling the area in his car. He recognised the offenders' clothing and appearance from earlier security video footage and, as a result, approached them. By this time the transfer of the goods was complete and all offenders were in  
          (the applicant’s) 
           car.  
          (The applicant) 
           drove his car at the security guard's vehicle, colliding with it and pushing it out of the way, but damaged the front tyre guard of his own vehicle in the process.  
          (The applicant) 
           then drove away. 
           
           
          A short time later,  
          (the applicant)  
          stopped at a local mechanical shop to try to have the damage to his car repaired. The tyre guard was pushed in on the tyre. The mechanics at the garage had heard a police radio alert and, on seeing the goods in the back of  
          (the applicant’s)  
          vehicle, phoned police, who attended very quickly. When the offenders saw police coming, Brown decamped on foot and Crossley and  
          (the applicant) 
           got into  
          (the applicant’s)  
          vehicle and drove off. 
            
          An extensive police pursuit ensued. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Crossley and  
          (the applicant) 
           were eventually stopped and arrested. However, before his arrest could be completed, Crossley jumped into a police vehicle and attempted to put it in motion. Police had to smash the police car window in order to effect Crossley's arrest. 
           
           
          These offences in the case of Crossley and  
          (the applicant) 
           give rise to offences on their schedules. [Form 1 matters] 
          
         
        
        
         
          
         
        
       
      10 After his arrest the applicant found himself at the Frank Baxter Juvenile Detention Centre at Kariong. The events that took place there were summarised by his Honour as follows -  
       
        
         
          
          At about 1.05pm on Sunday 13 June 2004, Terrence Roberts, an officer of the department of Juvenile Justice, was on duty in the kitchen area of the Stickland Unit that is part of the Frank Baxter Juvenile Detention Centre at Kariong. Officer Roberts and the offender were involved in cleaning up after lunch. The offender was talking to other detainees about certain evens said to have happened before his detention. The topic of conversation led to the comment being made by officers Britland and Roberts. The offender picked up a steel mop bucket of dirty water and threw the contents into the face of officer Roberts. The dirty water went all over Mr Roberts and went into his eyes and mouth. The offender then threw the steel mop bucket at Mr Roberts, striking him on the right knee. The offender was yelling at Roberts ""Fucking old man, fuck you. I should smash you."" 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          The offender was restrained by another youth worker and was removed from the area. This activity gives rise to count 1 on  
          (the applicant’s) 
           second indictment, which is an offence of assaulting a law enforcement officer, not being a police officer, whilst in the execution of the officer's duty. Pursuant to section 60A(1) of the Crimes Act 1900, it carries a maximum penalty of five years. [Count 1 on second indictment] 
          
         
        
        
         
          
          About 7.15 pm on Wednesday 30 
            
          June 2004,  
          (the applicant)  
          complained to Officer Peebles that a phone call he made had dropped out. The offender made another call that also dropped out. The offender then started banging the hand set against the phone, saying, ""Fuck this thing, it's fucked."" An officer then instructed the offender to stop. The offender threw the handset against the wall and walked off, 
            
          saying somebody was going to get hurt if he did not get his phone call that night. 
          
         
         
          
          Officer Clissold was requested to attend the location and did so. The offender returned to the area. He had his right wrist raised and was saying, ""Somebody's going to get hurt if I don't get my call tonight."" 
          
         
         
          
          The offender approached Officer Clissold, grabbed hold of the front of his shirt and pushed him backwards into a wall. After a period of time the offender was restrained. This activity forms the basis of count 2 upon the indictment which is identical to count 1. [Count 2 on second indictment] 
          
         
         
          
          About 8.30am on Thursday 1 July 2004, the offender was being moved to the holding room as a result of the events which are the subject of count 2. Whilst being transported, the offender ran  
          off  
          and climbed an internal fence adjacent to the centre's gym. Once on the roof, he pulled out the inner section of the Foxtel dish and called out, ""If any cunt comes up here they will get it."" The offender then smashed the dish and the receiver. 
          
         
         
          
          After a period of negotiation the offender was removed from the roof. 
          
         
         
          
          This activity forms the basis of count 3 in the indictment, which is a count of malicious damage. Pursuant to section 195A  
          of  
          the Act, this carries a maximum penalty of five years imprisonment. [Count 3 second indictment] 
          
         
         
          
          About 4.45pm on Monday 5 July 2004, the offender and a number of other detainees were on the tennis court area. The offender wanted to go to the oval area. He was informed that the detainees from his unit were unable to use the oval on that day. The offender began to yell at staff members, ""You dogs are cunts."" He began throwing rubbish around the tennis court area, kicked office doors and a fire hydrant. The offender turned the hydrant on. Officer Jones told the offender to settle down, to which the offender replied, ""Fuck you, you dog."" Jones manoeuvred past the offender and turned the hydrant off. 
          
         
         
          
          The offender commenced to throw rubbish at the officer. The offender was told to stop. The offender walked towards Mr Jones saying, ""Come on, have a go. I'm going to bash your head in."" The offender began throwing punches at Mr Jones. His fists were clenched. The offender struck Mr Jones  
          in  
          the right temple and ear. Mr Jones grabbed the offender, placing him in a bear hug, and took him to the ground."" 
          
         
         
          
          This activity gives rise to count 4 in the indictment, which is in terms identical to count 1. [Count 4 on second indictment]  
          
         
         
          
          The offender continued to struggle whilst on the ground. Another detainee became involved in the incident. Officer Walsh went to the assistance of Mr Jones. Officer Walsh attempted to subdue the offender whilst Officer Jones attended to the other detainee who had become involved. Officer Walsh, with the assistance of other officers, lifted the offender to his feet and began to escort him to the isolation area. The offender continued to struggle and was handcuffed. After being cuffed and en route to the isolation area, the offender head butted Officer Walsh. The offender's forehead came into contact with Officer Walsh's right cheek. The offender then spat directly into Mr Walsh's face. He was again subdued and escorted to the isolation area. 
          
         
         
          
          This activity gives rise to count 5 on the indictment, which is in terms identical to count 1. [Count 5 on second indictment] 
          
         
         
          
          At about 12.20 pm on 2 September 2004, the offender was in the Carinya Unit dining room along with several other detainees. A disturbance started between a number of detainees. The offender was seen by staff to kick a toaster bolted down to the kitchen bench. He was told by staff to stop kicking the toaster and to settle down. The offender told the staff: ""Get fucked, I'll do what I want to do. We run this centre, not you guys."" 
          
         
         
          
          A number of other detainees commenced to throw items around the dining room. The offender obtained a lighter from another detainee. He then set fire to a bread bag, dish cloth and pillow case. Once the pillow case was well alight, the offender dangled it above and onto the carpet. 
          
         
         
          
          This forms the basis of count 7 on the indictment which is a count of malicious damage by fire. Pursuant to section 195B of the Act, that carries a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment. [Count 7 on second indictment] 
          
         
         
          
          When the pillow case was well alight, Officer Hansen approached the offender in an attempt to remove the pillow case from him. The offender swung the burning pillow case at Officer Hansen, striking him to the left side of the head, face and neck. Officer Hansen received minor burns to the areas referred to. After a short period of time the offender was escorted away. 
          
         
         
          
          The activity involving Officer Hansen forms the basis of count 6 in the indictment, which is a count of assaulting a law enforcement officer, not being a police officer, while in the execution of the officer's duty, and by the assault, occasioning actual bodily harm. The maximum penalty for that offence pursuant to s 60A (2) of the Act is seven years imprisonment. [Count 6 on second indictment] 
          
         
         
          
          About 10.50am on 18 September 2004, Officer Pedavoli was on duty in the Carinya dining room. The offender entered the dining room. He had his fists clenched and began to walk round and round the room. He was yelling ""Fuck you"". Pedavoli told the offender, ""Calm down,  
          (the applicant) 
          "". The offender then picked up a hot water Esky and threw it. Pedavoli again told the offender to calm down. The offender said: ""Fuck off. I've lost me visits. I'll bash you, you old cunt. Fuck off”. 
          
         
         
          
          As he was speaking the offender was walking quickly towards Officer Pedavoli. The offender came up to Officer Pedavoli and swung several punches at him. Officer Pedavoli ducked, but at least one punch struck him to the left side of the face. Officer Pedavoli grabbed the offender to restrain him and ended up on one knee. The offender then backed off and walked away. 
          
         
         
          
          This activity forms the basis of count 8 on the indictment, which is in terms identical to count 1. [Count 8 on second indictment] 
          
         
         
          
          The offender and another detainee were then calmed and secured within the Program Unit. About 1.30pm the offender and the other detainee barricaded themselves within the common room and the Programs Unit. The common area is furnished with lounges, a pay phone, and kitchen facilities, including a fridge, stove, sink, fixed tables and cooking benches. The offender and the other detainees then smashed the steel water pipes away from the sink and then used those items to smash furniture, the fridge, stove and pay phone. The door of the fridge was torn off and the pay phone smashed from the wall. The stove was smashed and the lounges damaged. 
          
         
         
          
          These activities give rise to the count of affray which is contained on a Form 1 and which is to be taken into account when  
          (the applicant) 
           is dealt with on count 8 in the second indictment. [Form 1 offence] 
            
          The other activity forms the basis of count 9 on the indictment, which is a count of malicious damage, carrying a maximum penalty of five years imprisonment as does the count of affray. [Count 9 on second indictment]. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
       
      11 The first ground of appeal asserts that his Honour failed to have regard to the lesser culpability of the applicant in those offences common to or connected with those committed by the co-offenders. The second ground of appeal asserts that his Honour failed to have proper regard to the applicant’s youth, in particular relative to the ages of the co-offenders.  
       
        
       
      12 It was not submitted that his Honour misunderstood or misstated the roles played by the three participants. Rather, this Court was invited to infer from the sentences themselves that his Honour must have failed to take sufficient account of the differences of roles favourable to the applicant. 
       
        
       
      13 It was submitted that although his Honour decided to deal with the applicant according to law, a decision which was not challenged on appeal, his Honour was still obliged to take into account the age of the applicant. He was seventeen years and three months of age when he committed the offences in the first Indictment. Brown and Crossley were each, at eighteen years and seven months of age, one year and four months older. The submission was that his Honour’s references to youth appeared to be common to all offenders and that remarks about the applicant’s insight, maturity and acceptance of responsibility were of a kind commonly made about young adults, not appearing to be linked at all to the fact that the applicant was under eighteen years of age at the time of the offences. It could not be submitted that any of his Honour’s references to the youth of the applicant was erroneous on its face. As with the case about the relative roles of the offenders, any conclusion that his Honour failed to take proper account of the applicant’s age or of the difference between his age and the ages of the co-offenders could be available only by inference from the sentences themselves. It is therefore necessary to compare the individual and total effective sentences imposed on the applicant, and on Brown and Crossley.  
       
        
       
      14 The table set out hereunder lists each of the counts in the applicants first Indictment. The sentence for each offence is expressed in whole years or fractions of years, non-parole period added to parole period producing a total term. An asterisk denotes any sentence that took into account scheduled offences.

      15 The nine counts in the second Indictment, based on the events at Kariong between 13 June and 18 September 2004, were solely the responsibility of the applicant. Neither Brown nor Crossley was involved. In the same way there were matters for which Brown was sentenced that were peculiar to him and matters for which Crossley was sentenced that were peculiar to him. To add to the complication, the applicant, Brown and Crossley were dealt with differentially for matters in which they were all involved, for example, in the robbery of the BP service station at Warners Bay the applicant was sentenced (count 2), whereas both Brown and Crossley were not charged with that offence but given the benefit of its inclusion on a schedule. In the robbery of Ms Slarks and in the attack on Mr Carroll the applicant was charged only with being an accessory after the fact, whereas Brown and Crossley were charged with the principal offence. The applicant was not charged over the burning of the Subaru.  
       
        
       
      16 The total effective sentence passed on Brown was one of nine years, comprising a non-parole period of five years three months and a balance of term of three years nine months. Crossley’s sentence totalled eight years, comprising a non-parole period of four years and three months and a balance of term of three years and nine months.  
       
        
       
      17 But for the sentences imposed for the offences in the second Indictment, the applicant’s total effective sentence would have been of five years and three months, comprising a non-parole period of three years and three months and a balance of term of two years. The excision from the sentences of Brown and Crossley of offences with which the applicant was not concerned would require some such similar adjustment, of course.  
       
        
       
      18 All offenders received sentences far less than the relevant maxima and far less than the relevant standard non-parole periods on account merely of the number of offences, the shortness of the period of time during which they were committed, and their youth. The necessary application of the principle of totality of criminality made it necessary for his Honour to pay careful regard to the total effective sentence resulting for each offender.  
       
        
       
      19 These matters demonstrate that it is impossible to make any but a broad comparison of the sentences and roles of the applicant, Brown and Crossley. It seems to me that the overall sentence imposed on each of the three offenders reflected their respective criminality and ages. Such a comparison does not appear to me to demonstrate that his Honour lost sight of the lesser role played by the applicant in, for example, the theft of the Subaru. And it is necessary to observe that the applicant did not play a minor part throughout. The success of the enterprise of the three depended very much on the skill and determination of the driver. The applicant played that major role. In my opinion his Honour was entitled to conclude that there was no clear leader. I would not infer that his Honour did not in the individual sentences and in the total effective term give proper weight to the part played from time to time by the applicant.  
       
        
       
      20 I would not infer that his Honour lost sight of the fact that Brown and Crossley were adults whereas the applicant was still a child. The difference in their ages, one year and four months, does not seem to me to justify any greater discrimination than that made by his Honour.  
       
        
       
      21 These grounds of appeal have not been made good. 
       
        
       
      22 The third and last ground of appeal was that the overall sentence and effective non-parole period were manifestly excessive. Counsel drew attention to the age of the applicant and the ages of the co-offenders, the applicant’s greater willingness to admit his offences, causing the sentencing judge to note that there was “ 
      at least some hint of recognition on his part that what he had done was wrong 
      ”, the applicant’s unsettled and unstable family circumstances, the fact that the applicant had been sexually assaulted when very young, the applicant’s apparent insight and maturity, as reported in the Juvenile Justice report and his Honour’s conclusion, following the applicant’s evidence, that he was remorseful. 
       
        
       
      23 The matter is one of impression. Balancing all these matters with the totality of the applicant’s criminality, I conclude that the sentences imposed, and each of them, fell within his Honour’s sentencing discretion. This ground of appeal has not been made good. 
       
        
       
      24 I propose that leave to appeal against sentence be granted but that the appeal be dismissed.

    SENTENCE1 HIS HONOUR: Renae Anne Hall appears today for sentence in relation to an offence alleging that she, on 6 November 2004 at Wagga Wagga in the State of New South Wales, did rob James Hutchison of one Wagga Credit Union card, one New South Wales’ driver’s licence, one black Rip Curl wallet and 300 Australian dollars, the property of James Hutchison.2 This offence is an offence brought pursuant to s 94 Crimes Act and carries a maximum penalty of fourteen years imprisonment. It does not have a standard non-parole period. The plea of guilty was entered at the arraignment of the accused and was accepted by the Crown in discharge of an indictment alleging, as a principal offence, an offence of robbery in company, which carries a maximum penalty of twenty years.3 There is an agreed statement of facts which I need not dwell upon beyond pointing out that the crime committed against Mr Hutchison involved a vicious attack upon an intoxicated man. The prisoner’s role was to comply with the request of a passenger in her car who she understood was going to rob the victim.4 The Crown does not allege, however, that she anticipated that the method of the robbery - that is, the method of the assault, the striking of the victim with a shovel - would occur, and the Crown concedes that the prisoner received no financial benefit from the crime.5 As I said to the prisoner just a moment ago, the offence reflected a gross lapse of judgment on her part.6 The prisoner, at the time, had a dependency upon amphetamines and I understand some other issues in relation to alcohol usage, and this may have, on this night, affected her judgment, the crime occurring in Bourke Street, Wagga Wagga, at 3.45am on 6 November 2004.7 It should not be taken, of course, that in determining this matter as I will by granting the prisoner a bond, I am condoning street violence in Wagga or robbery of any individual in the early hours of the morning or at any other time at any other place in the state. But every crime needs to be determined on its facts and the facts of the matter are that whilst the prisoner is liable for the crime of robbery under joint criminal enterprise principles, the prisoner’s role was a minor one. The plan to rob the victim was clearly that of the male offender, and the prisoner’s involvement was one where she received no financial gain.8 It is important too in assessing the objective criminality of the prisoner to note that the perpetrator of the attack upon the victim was a person that the prisoner says to me, and I accept, she did not know well. She certainly would not have known, I would have thought, acting reasonably, that the man Smith had convictions going back to the early nineties in adult courts and findings of guilt in the Children’s Court before that. He had a conviction for malicious wound with intent to cause grievous bodily harm for which he received a fixed term of five years in 1997, and, in 1998, he was convicted of robbery whilst armed with a dangerous weapon for which he received a total sentence of six years with a minimum term of four years.9 Thus it could not reasonably have been anticipated, albeit that her conduct was criminal, that Mr Smith would engage in the activity which she neither knew of beforehand, nor, I am satisfied, condoned.10 Another matter that is relevant to the assessment of her involvement in this matter and is also quite relevant in the subjective sense is the fact that at the time of the commission of the offence she was twenty-five years of age and at that time had no prior criminal convictions. Therefore her lapse of judgment was entirely uncharacteristic. Also, it could be fairly said, the absence of convictions demonstrates that she was otherwise of good character and is entitled to considerable leniency for this offence, at that age, being her first offence.11 I note in relation to her criminal history that she was convicted in December 2005 for offences committed in August 2005. There are a large number of offences - four counts of goods in custody and nine counts of obtain money by deception. I do not have the facts of those matters but the explanation given by her partner would fit with what I can see is the essence of the offences. She apparently obtained a chequebook, presumably sought to obtain money by deceiving people into accepting herself as the owner of the chequebook and obtained property from her conduct.12 But be that as it may, even if I do not have a full understanding of the facts of that matter, one thing is obvious, and that is, that those offences themselves were a manifestation of a longstanding dependency or abuse of prohibited drugs, particularly amphetamines.13 The other significant aspect of those matters is that the crime with which I am concerned was committed before those offences were committed, and most importantly, unlike the understanding I had when the accused was arraigned, the crime that I was concerned with was not committed whilst on bail in relation to those offences or while the accused was subject to conditional liberty which is by way of a bond as is obvious.14 The prisoner, I note, has complied with the terms of those bonds granted in the Local Court. She has not been charged with any offences since her appearance at the Tamworth Local Court and this is to her credit, despite the fact that those bonds were unsupervised bonds.15 I have had regard to the references that have been written by her aunt and her mother and an employer from the rural community from which her family comes. I note her family are people of the land who have been involved in poultry farming. Her mother, naturally, speaks well of her and seeks the court’s leniency and I note that request. Her aunt also speaks well of her and attests to her positive qualities which are reflected, in my view, by the fact that she, prior to this offence, for twenty-five years had led a blameless life apart from her dependency on drugs.16 She now lives with Mr Trow who gave evidence. The prisoner is a mother of a child aged seven, and I note that she has taken on the responsibility of Mr Trow’s child who is aged fourteen, and that, as I understood Mr Trow’s evidence, she is effectively a loving and dependable homemaker for himself and the children, although she may also have other obligations when work opportunities arise.17 Mr Trow has been a positive influence upon her life. He had known the prisoner and her family for twenty years but did not develop a relationship with her until after she returned from Wagga to the Tamworth area from whence her family comes. He knew of her drug dependency or her drug issues, as I might describe them. She did not immediately desist from drug usage, as one might expect would be the case. Drug dependency is a difficult issue to address.18 But it is clear, as time has evolved, particularly after the experience of appearing in court in late December 2005, that the offender has reduced her drug usage to the point where, by the time Mr Trow and the offender set up house in Gloucester in July 2006, the indicia of her behaviour were consistent with her having effectively overcome her dependency, which is very much to her credit.19 The Probation and Parole Service report records a history of stopping amphetamine usage after five years in June-July 2006, consistent with what Mr Trow has told me, and there is evidence from Dr Campbell-Smith that the prisoner has sought medical assistance prior to that time, not only for drug dependence but for obsessive-compulsive behaviour symptoms which were also the subject of evidence from Mr Trow.20 I am satisfied on the evidence contained in the Probation and Parole Service report and Mr Trow’s evidence that the prisoner now has stable domestic circumstances. She has severed any connection, such as it was, she had with her co-offenders and is making considerable progress to make herself a worthwhile member of the community, which she had been, as I have pointed out, up until the time of the commission of this offence.21 It is thought that she will benefit from the supervision of the service to address both drug and alcohol issues and also to perhaps assist her in other ways. I also note her willingness to be supervised and her cooperation would be vital.22 It is important in dealing with this matter in the way I propose to, that I should note that well before she pleaded guilty to the offence a few days ago for which she must now be sentenced, she had offered her cooperation to the New South Wales Police Service in May 2006, many months before she pleaded guilty before me. Police travelled to Tamworth and obtained a statement from her which no doubt will be valuable in the prosecution of Mr Smith. 23 It would appear, on the basis of his record and the facts of this case, that Mr Smith is a dangerous person, and her assistance in bringing him to justice will be vital, not only to assuage the feelings of the victim, but also in protecting the community from Mr Smith’s violent impulses.24 I have noted that cooperation. The relevant formalities, as I understand it, have not been completed as yet, but I do not believe I need to have complete evidence in relation to this issue because of the way in which I propose to address it. But the Crown’s position is, as I understood it, that the prisoner’s cooperation has been effective and complete and is significant. The prisoner is prepared to give evidence in the future against Mr Smith. 25 I note the evidence of Mr Trow that the prisoner has fears for her safety arising from the fact that she has cooperated with the police. It would seem to me that whilst she should not have her fears aggravated by what I am about to say, that she has good reason to be concerned for her safety given Mr Smith’s violent past, and of course, the violence demonstrated by the commission of this offence.26 It is the Crown case, I point out, that Smith himself was the person who not only removed the property from the victim but kept the property for himself.27 I note Natasha Bickley was dealt with as an accessory after the fact to the robbery of this victim. Her Honour Judge Payne, in a careful judgment, gave her the benefit of a bond pursuant to s 9 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. 28 I note in relation to Miss Bickley, of course, she pleaded guilty to a less serious offence carrying a maximum penalty of two years imprisonment, a much lesser maximum penalty than here. 29 However, that being so, I do not believe that my proposed order in relation to this matter represents any significant “disparity” or significant departure from what is reasonable, notwithstanding the orders that were made in Miss Bickley’s matter.30 Miss Bickley, of course, entered her plea at the first reasonable opportunity available to her. That could not be said of Miss Hall, in one view of it, although I am not required, in the circumstances of the matter, to assess the utilitarian benefit of the plea of guilty.31 I would accept that it is a plea that has greater utilitarian value than a plea entered at the commencement of a trial but less than that which would warrant the maximum discount, if I could use that expression, as articulated in the decision of Thomson and Houlton.32 Of course, assessing these matters where there is to be no term of imprisonment is not a precise science, but I have factored into my assessment of this matter the fact that the plea of guilty is one with some utilitarian value, falling short of the maximum benefit.33 I note in relation to Miss Bickley that she spent some time in custody and she was younger than the offender, but that does not persuade me that I should approach this matter by imposing upon this offender a term of imprisonment, albeit suspended as I would otherwise if considering a term of imprisonment, provided that term of imprisonment was two years or less.34 I also note Miss Bickley had no prior criminal convictions.35 It would seem to me that the prisoner’s culpability is greater than Miss Bickley’s but not so much so as to warrant the imposition of a custodial penalty.36 In sentencing the offender, I have had regard to s 3A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. I have also had regard to s 21A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and the relevant aggravating circumstances particularised in subs (2).37 In this particular matter, it is to be fairly said that the victim was a vulnerable person, being a person alone in the early hours of the morning, well affected by alcohol. In my view that, and the fact that the prisoner was in company with Mr Smith, can be properly seen as aggravating factors.38 But, having pointed that out, it should be fairly said that with Mr Smith being the driving force in relation to this matter, the aggravations are not such as to warrant the imposition of a custodial penalty.39 The mitigating factors are many. Relevant mitigating factors that I identify at this point are the fact that the offence was not a planned offence save for the opportunistic planning that occurred as revealed in the facts. Apparently Mr Hutchison, the victim, suffered some bruising, but fortunately, notwithstanding the severity of the attack upon him, no significant injuries, and ultimately, it must be fairly said, the prisoner is not at least morally culpable for the injuries that he suffered. She did not foresee that he would be injured.40 I note that the prisoner has no prior convictions, as I have pointed out, was a person of good character, is unlikely to re-offend, and has excellent prospects of rehabilitation with Mr Trow’s assistance.41 I note the plea of guilty as a mitigating factor to be recognised in sentencing her, and of course, cooperation is a relevant matter, and I have noted the terms of both the assistance as provided for under subs (3) of s 21A as a mitigating factor and of course the terms of s 23 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.42 Ultimately, the appropriate disposal of this matter, in my view, is to determine that the offender should be placed on a bond to be of good behaviour pursuant to s 9 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. 43 Thus, hopefully having taken into account all relevant matters, I make the following orders. You can stand up, thanks very much, ma’am.44 In relation to this matter, you are convicted. Pursuant to s 9 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, I order that you enter into a good behaviour bond for a period of three years from today. 45 Conditions applying during the term of the bond are as follows:46 Firstly, you are to appear before court if called to do so at any time.47 Secondly, you are to be of good behaviour.48 Thirdly, you are to advise the registrar of the District Court at Wagga Wagga of any change of residential address.49 Fourthly, you are to accept the supervision and guidance of the New South Wales Probation and Parole Service particularly at Taree for such period as the service requires and obey all reasonable directions of the officers of that Service, especially any directions regarding alcohol and drug treatment and counselling.50 Fifthly, you are to report to the Officer in Charge of the Probation and Parole Service at Taree within seven days of today to enable such supervision and guidance to commence, and a further condition of the bond is that you are to cooperate with the Director of Public Prosecutions in respect of matters for which you have given or will give an undertaking.51 Is that sufficient for your purposes Mr Crown?52 CORR: Yes your Honour.53 HIS HONOUR: You can take a seat. Do you understand those conditions Miss Hall?54 OFFENDER: Yes your Honour.55 HIS HONOUR: If you breach those conditions you’ll be in breach of the bond. If you breach any one of those conditions you will be in breach of the bond and you’ll be called up for sentence and I have the power to revoke the bond, and if I revoke the bond then I will have to consider other orders including the imposition of a custodial sentence. So take a seat just for the moment.56 Any technical matters from you Mr Crown?57 CORR: No your Honour.58 HIS HONOUR: Any technical matters from you Mr Blackburn?59 BLACKBURN: No your Honour.

      JUDGMENT 
      
    The Application1 HIS HONOUR: The defendant by his counsel applies by way of a notice of motion for an order that I disqualify myself from further hearing this case.2 The application was made in the morning of the fourteenth day of the hearing of two prosecutions of the defendant, Geoffrey Noel Freeman for offences against s 118 D(1) of the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1974 (“the NP&W Act”), by s 175B(1) of that Act, in that he was a person concerned in the management of a corporation, Port Macquarie – Hastings Council, which caused damage to the habitat of threatened species, knowing that the land concerned was habitat of that kind. The threatened species identified by the prosecutor are the Eastern Chestnut Mouse and the Grass Owl.3 Mr I J Hemmings and Mr E Y Ozen appearing for the defendant, rely upon the settled principle of apprehended bias, that is, that the trial judge must be disqualified if he has conducted himself in such a way that a fair-minded observer might reasonably apprehended that he might not bring an impartial and unprejudiced mind to the resolution of the question whether the defendant ought to be convicted: Antoun v The Queen (2006) 80 ALJR 497 at [1]. 
     
      
    4 The grounds, upon which the application is made, as I understand them, are as follows: 
     
      
       
      (a) At the close of the prosecutor’s case the defendant counsel submitted that there was no case for the defendant to answer. In the course of rejecting the submission I said (at [3]): 
       
       
        
        The evidence adduced by the prosecutor has established the following facts (at least, on a  
        prima facie 
         basis) beyond a reasonable doubt: that the defendant was, at all relevant times, concerned in the management of the council; the council constructed two roads, running through an area owned by the council and known as the Partridge Creek area west of Port Macquarie Airport; the defendant caused the council to construct the roads; the area through which the roads were constructed was habitat of the Eastern Chestnut Mouse and also the Grass Owl, both being threatened species within the meaning of the  
        National Parks and Wildlife Act 
        ; the roads damaged the habitat of those species, both directly and indirectly; and, when the defendant caused the roads to be constructed, he knew that the area was habitat of those species. That is, the evidence  
        as it stands 
         establishes that the offences described in the charges have been proved beyond reasonable doubt.  
        
       
       
        
        See  
        Garrett v Freeman (No. 2) 
         [2006] NSWLEC 334 
        
       
       
        
        It is submitted that my findings went further than necessary and all that I was required to find was that there existed a prima facie case and in going further and finding that the prosecutor had established the charges beyond reasonable doubt I had formed a concluded view that the defendant was guilty of the offences as charged. 
        
       
       
      (b) In the course of ruling on the admissibility of evidence, on the thirteenth day of the hearing, I said on three occasions that the defendant had provided misleading answers in response to questions asked of him in two statutory notices requiring him to provide information and documentation relating to the land in question. 
       
       
        
        As I understand the submission, it is said that in expressing the view that the answers that the defendant gave were misleading, I had already formed the opinion that the answers were in fact misleading and had thus given an impermissible indication of prejudgment and had, therefore, compromised the appearance of impartiality. Reliance was placed, in particular on  
        Antoun v The Queen 
         at [22], [24], [33], [46]-[48] and [81]. It is further submitted that the view that I expressed – that the defendant’s answers were misleading – were not tentative views, but were expression of a concluded opinion. 
        
       
       
      (c) The substantial complaint of the defendant relates to my statements that the defendant’s answers to the statutory notices were misleading. As I understand it, the defendant does not rely upon what I said in ruling on the no case to answer submission as a discrete and separate ground for disqualification but rather as indicative of the context in which the substantial complaint arose and indicative of a state of mind suggestive of prejudgment. 
       
      
    5 The question of whether judicial observations can exceed what is proper and reasonable is a matter of judgment taking into account all the circumstances of the case: Concrete Pty Ltd v Parramatta Design & Developments Pty Ltd (2006) 231 ALR 663. It is necessary, therefore to set out the circumstances in which the question now before me arose.The Facts6 I have set out in par [4(a)] above the statement complained of in the course of my ruling on the no case to answer submission. That ruling was given as I have said, following the close of the prosecutor’s case on the ninth day of the hearing on 15 June 2006. The hearing resumed before me on 12 March 2007. The complaint that those remarks are indicative of prejudgment was made in support of the present application for disqualification on 16 March 2007, being the fourteenth day of the hearing. In these circumstances the judgments in Vakauta v Kelly (1989) 167 CLR 568 are relevant: where comments which are likely to convey to a reasonable and intelligent lay observer an impression of bias have been made, a party who has legal representation is not entitled to stand by until the content of the final judgment are known and then, if those contents are unpalatable, attack the judgment by reason of the earlier comments. Although in the present case a final judgment is yet to be delivered, the principle nevertheless applies to the circumstances here. Moreover, as acknowledged in Vakauta v Kelly (at 577 and 586) an objection on the ground of bias can be waived, even in a criminal case. 
    7 The defendant has at all times been represented by counsel. In the present case the facts which are said to give rise to an apprehension of prejudgment arose on 15 June 2006. The prosecutor is thus entitled to assume that, in allowing some nine months to pass without complaint, the defendant had waived the right to be heard to complain. In my opinion, the defendant has by reason of conduct waived any right to be heard to complain. 
    8 I have noted, however, that the defendant nevertheless relies upon remarks made in the determining no case to answer submission as supporting the principal complaint that the observations I made on the thirteenth day of the hearing are indicative of an impression of prejudgment. It is necessary, therefore to turn to the circumstances in which the latter observations were made. 
    9 The issues for trial are, as I understand them: (a) Was the land in question habitat of the two threatened species? (b) Did the council do a thing, namely, construct roads? (c) Did the constructing of the roads cause damage to the habitat? (d) Did the council know at the time of constructing the roads that the land concerned was habitat of that kind? (e) At the time of the alleged offence, was the defendant a person concern in the management of the corporation, that is, the council? (f) Has the prosecutor negated the defence in s 118D(2) of the Act – that is, that the work was essential for the carrying out of an activity within the meaning of Pt 5 of the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979 (“the EP&A Act”) and that the council complied with that Part. 
    10 The acts constituting the offence, as alleged by the prosecutor, are that the council constructed two roads across a large area of land which it owned and which lies to the west of Port Macquarie airport. The land is habitat of the two threatened species. One road runs in a north-south direction and the other road runs in an east-west direction. The defendant was at that time the council’s Director of Infrastructure Services and the prosecutor alleges that it is he who caused the council to construct the roads. It is further alleged that the construction of the roads caused damage both directly and indirectly to the habitat of the two threatened species. 
    11 The work was commenced under the defendant’s direction in early September 2003. The sites of the roads were first slashed to assist in locating survey lines. The first road to be constructed, as I understand the evidence, was the north-south road with work commencing at its southern end. 
    12 The defendant has given evidence. He says that after commencement of construction at the southern end of the north-south road he was alerted to the fact that the area was habitat of threatened species. His attention was drawn to two ecological reports about the land in the council’s files, one by a firm of consultants known as ERM and one by an environmental consultant, Mr P A Redpath, which identified the land as habitat for the species in question. The defendant also saw a plan of management that had been prepared for the land, and an archaeology report. 
    13 The defendant then prepared a document which he described in evidence as a preliminary review of environmental factors (“the REF”). The defendant says that in preparing the REF he had regard to the abovementioned reports and the plan of management. The defendant formed the view that the works were acceptable, that there were not likely to be any significant impacts such as to require either an environmental impact statement or a species impact statement or any further investigation and he allowed the work to continue. 
    14 On 28 May 2004 Mr S Beaumont, an investigator with the Department of Environment and Conservation of New South Wales (“the DEC”), served a notice upon the General Manager of the council under s 169 of the NP&W Act requiring him to provide information and assistance into the department’s investigation of the alleged damage to the habitat of the threatened species. The notice became Exhibit J. The information and assistance required by the notice included a request for copies of all documents in relation to the land. By s 169(3) of the Act a person must not refuse to give the information and other assistance requested or knowingly give any information that is false or misleading in a material particular. 
    15 By a letter dated 18 June 2004, the notice was answered by the defendant on behalf of the council in which the defendant made no mention of any documents in relation to the land and none were forwarded with the response, neither did the defendant respond to any of the other requests in the notice. The response became Exhibit K. 
    16 On 22 June 2004, Mr Beaumont sent a further document described as a notice under s 169 of the Act to the general manager of the council stating that the response from Mr Freeman did not address any of the requests outlined in the notice and requested that the information be provided by 2 July 2004. The notice stated that it is an offence to fail to provide information or reasonable assistance when requested by an officer of the department, or to knowingly provide information that is false or misleading in a material particular. The notice became Exhibit 5. 
    17 By letter dated 24 June 2004 addressed to Mr Beaumont the defendant asserted that his response of 18 June 2004 does provide the information and that there has been no breach of s 169 of the Act. This letter became Exhibit 6. 
    18 On 7 December 2004 Mr Beaumont served on the council a notice under s 193(1) of the Protection of the Environment Operation Act 1997 (“the POEO Act”), requiring the provision of information and records relating to the land in question. This notice became Exhibit L. The notice required the production, amongst other things, of a copy of all documentation in relation to the land in question – item 1 of the notice; a copy of any written procedures for the preparation of reviews of environmental factors undertaken by the council to which Pt 5 of the EP&A Act applies – item 3 of the notice; and a copy of all documents referred to in the preparation of the review of environmental factors – item 6 of the notice.  
     
      
    19 On 24 December 2004 the response to the notice was again provided by the defendant. The response became Exhibit M. In answer to the request in item 1 of the notice the defendant said: “Apart from other information and documents referred to in this letter there is no documentation in response to the paragraph 1 of your notice”. I note that there are no documents otherwise referred to in the response. In answer to the request in item 3 of the notice the defendant said: “No documentation exists”. In answer to the request in item 6 of the notice the defendant said: “There are no documents”. 
    20 On 20 January 2005 Mr Beaumont sent a letter to the council. The letter states: 
     
      
       
        
        On the morning of the 19 January 2005, I had a telephone conversation with Mr Freeman and queried why documentation such as scientific reports, species impact statements etc. in relation to ‘The Land”, had not been provided as per Notice. Mr Freeman has informed me that on seeking legal advice from Mr Steven Miles Solicitor from ‘Donovan, Oakes, Hannaford’, it was his (Mr Freeman’s) understanding that the Notice referred to the constructed road only and not the site. This is not the case. 
        
       
       
        
        I draw you attention to paragraphs two and three of the 7 December 2004 Notice: 
         
         
        1. The DEC is investigating the alleged damage to the habitat of threatened Fauna Species, namely the  
        Grass Owl, Wallum Froglet and Eastern Chestnut Mouse 
        , on lots 100,140, 204, 235, 236, 237, 250, 333, 378 DP 754434 and Lot 899494, (‘The land’). 
         
         
        2. According to information acquired by the DEC, the construction of roadways across “The land” has resulted in the damage to Threatened Species Habitat. 
         
         
        The Notice then requests information and records in relation to “The Land”. 
        
       
      
    21 The reply to the letter of 20 January 2005 came in the form of a letter from Mr S Miles of Donovan Oates Hannaford lawyers, of Port Macquarie, dated 18 February 2005. The letter states: 
     
      
       
        
        We refer to your letter to our client Hastings Council dated 20 January 2005. We have read carefully the points you make in your letter together with the responses provided by Council to the previous notices that you have served upon them. It is clear to us that Council has complied with its lawful obligations to provide information to you. In our opinion, the demands that you are now making upon Council for further information are not authorised to be made by you by Section 193 of the Protection of the Environment Operations Act. To this extent those parts of your notice or letter of 20 January 2005, which are not properly authorised by Section 193 of the Protection of the Environment Operations Act, are ultra vires. A clear example of this is paragraph 18 of your notice of 7 December 2004. 
        
       
      
    22 I have earlier noted the evidence of the defendant himself that he had prepared a document which he calls a REF and in doing so he referred to the ecological reports that I have earlier described. The defendant’s responses to the two notices make no reference to either the REF or to the documents to which he had recourse and none of these documents were produced in answer to the notices. 
    23 In giving his evidence the defendant was asked about the answers he had forwarded in response to the notices. He said that before responding to the notices he had sought legal advice. He was also cross-examined on his responses to the notices. It is necessary to refer to some of that cross-examination. He was first questioned about the notice under s 169 of the NP&W Act (Exhibit J). After stating that he had received legal advice in relation to it he was asked the following questions and gave the following answers: 
     
      
       
        
        Q. And there’s no doubt that as at May 2004 you knew that council had a large amount of documentation in relation to those lots of land? 
         
        A. That’s correct. 
         
         
        Q. So did you produce it to the author of this notice? 
         
        A. I arranged for various staff who would have access to that material to compile that information and provide it to me which was then the basis of my response to the DEC. 
         
         
        Q. ’s [sic] land at Partridge Creek, didn’t you? 
         
        A. Correct. 
         
         
        Q. So that was a very wide category of documentation, wasn’t it? 
         
        A. It is. 
         
         
        Q. And there’s no doubt that as at May 2004 you knew that council had a large amount of documentation in relation to those lots of land? 
         
        A. That’s correct. 
         
         
        …. 
         
         
        Q. You know that no documentation was provided at all except your two page letter dated 18 June, exhibit K, don’t you Mr Freeman? 
         
        A. That advice, and that response, was provided on advice from my own - council’s own legal advice. 
         
         
        Q. That’s not the question I’m asking you sir. I’m not asking you why you sent the letter, exhibit K, I’m asking you isn’t it your knowledge that the only documents provided in response to that section 169 notice, was your one document, this two page letter, exhibit K, isn’t that your knowledge as you sit there in the witness box? 
         
        A. As it would appear that may be the case on the evidence that you presented me here. I just can recall, and I don’t recall that in relation to that first notice or this second notice, that certainly we had compiled all the information that was required by the department as and when it was required. I don’t believe that we at all avoided our legal obligations in that regard. 
         
         
        Q. Mr Freeman, your letter exhibit K, doesn’t refer to any of the paragraphs of the notice by number, or content specifically does it? 
         
        A. No it doesn’t. 
         
         
        Q. It doesn’t pretend to respond to any of the categories of documentation or information sought under that section 169 notice does it? 
         
        A. It doesn’t make specific reference to it no. 
         
         
        …. 
         
         
         
        Q. Can you explain why it is that your response, exhibit K does not contain any reference to the documentation sought in paragraph 1 of the notice, exhibit J? 
         
        A. No I can’t explain that. Other than that was the response that was provided on advice at that time. 
         
         
        … 
         
         
        Q. Why then didn’t you supply the documentation referred to in paragraph 1 of the notice? 
         
        A. I can only refer to my earlier answer which was that that response was provided on advice to the DEC. 
         
         
        Q. Why didn’t you provide the name, address and phone numbers of individuals involved in the works allegedly impacting habitat of the species identified in paragraph 2 as requested in that paragraph? 
         
        A. I can only restate my answer and say that advice, that response was provided to the DEC on advice. 
         
         
        Q. Do you mean to say you didn’t draft that letter? 
         
        A. I would’ve draft some of that letter and sought advice in terms of how best to respond to this request and provided that response based on that advice. 
         
         
        Q. Do you mean to say that a lawyer gave you advice not to provide the information contained in that 169 notice? 
         
        A. Our advice was to provide the response that was provided and that’s what I did. 
         
         
        … 
         
         
        HIS HONOUR 
         
         
        Q. Did you get the advice personally? 
         
        A. Correct. 
         
         
        Q. From whom? 
         
        A. Mr Miles. 
         
         
        Q. Whose Mr Miles? 
         
        A. Stephen Miles from Donovan Oates Hannaford. 
        
       
      
    24 The cross-examination then turned to the second notice, the one issued under s 193 of the POEO Act (Exhibit L). The defendant again stated that he sought legal advice and provided a response in accordance with that advice. There then occurred following exchange: 
     
      
       
        
        Q. Mr Miles, a partner of that firm, gave you legal advice that it at least was all right to respond to the request for all documentation in relation to the land by saying there is no documentation did he? 
         
        A. That’s correct, that’s my evidence. 
         
         
        Q. Is that because you told him there was no documentation, would that explain his advice? 
         
        A. I don't believe so, no. 
         
         
        Q. He must have known, on what you told him, that there was lots of documents, is that what you tell us? 
         
        A. I can only advise you that the responses I provided you was on advice. What Mr Miles knew at that time I can't advise you, but he was certainly aware of all the issues in relation to this site. 
         
         
        Q. Well let’s just think about it; did you discuss with Mr Miles how you should respond to paragraph one of that notice? 
         
        A. Correct. 
         
         
        Q. Did you tell him that you had a large quantity of documentation in relation to the land? 
         
        A. I believe I did, yes. 
         
         
        Q. So he advised you that it was all right to respond, “There is no documentation I relation to the land” did he, is that what you're telling us? 
         
        A. He advised me that this response met council’s legal obligation in responding to that notice. 
         
         
        Q. In the knowledge you say, because you told him, that there was in fact documentation in relation to the land? 
         
        A. I believe so, yes. 
         
         
        Q. Can I take you then to paragraph 6 of the notice, exhibit L; “Please provide a copy of all documents referred to in the preparation of the REF.” What did you understand the REF to be a reference to in that question? 
         
        A. A review of environmental factors. 
         
         
        Q. Did you understand it to be because of the use of the word ‘the’ before the letters ‘REF’ a reference to your preliminary REF? 
         
        A. I would assume so, yes. 
         
         
        Q. The answer to that question is on the second page of exhibit M, isn't it, paragraph 6? 
         
        A. Yes. 
         
         
        Q. Could you read it out please? 
         
        A. It says, “There are no documents.” 
         
         
        Q. There are two ways of approaching that response aren’t there? 
         
        A. Yes. 
         
         
        Q. One is that it’s true and was at the time you signed the letter, and the other is that it was untrue, those are the two approaches that can be taken to it, aren’t they? 
         
        A. Correct. 
         
         
        Q. Are there any other approaches that can be taken to it? 
         
        A. In terms of what documents referred to in the request, whether we’re talking about reports or other information or other forms of documents, that’s the only explanation I can give you. 
         
         
        Q. Well paragraph 6 of the request said please provide a copy of all documents referred to in the preparation of the REF, is that correct? 
         
        A. That’s what the question says, correct. 
         
         
        Q. You knew that at the time you wrote your answer? 
         
        A. Correct. 
         
         
        Q. Who had prepared the REF on your evidence? 
         
        A. I had. 
         
         
        Q. So these are the options aren’t they. One is that this statement is true, there were no documents that you refer to in the preparation of your preliminary REF, that is one possibility isn’t it? 
         
        A. That’s one possibility. 
         
         
        Q. And is that in fact true Mr Freeman, you didn’t refer to any reports, you didn’t refer to any documents when you ticked the boxes in your check list? 
         
        A. That’s in fact incorrect, I’ve given evidence of the extent of the documents that I’ve used in undertaking that assessment. 
         
         
        Q. Well that means that this statement in this letter, there are no documents, is untrue, doesn’t it? 
         
        A. In that context it would appear so. 
         
         
        Q. What other context could there be? 
         
        A. I’m unable to suggest one at the moment, but I certainly used all of the documents that Mr Aaso provided, in providing that response, in undertaking that REF. Why that response was provided in that form in terms of what it refers to, I cannot advise you further. 
         
        
       
      
    25 Mr Miles also gave evidence. His evidence covered the information that he was given by the defendant in relation to the notices and the advice that he furnished to the defendant in answering the notices. 
     
      
    26 In the course of the cross-examination of Mr Miles, objection was taken to the admissibility of some of the questions asked on various grounds, including their relevance. In the course of ruling on the admissibility I said, inter alia: 
     
      
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: … It is relevant to what advice Mr Miles gave to Mr Freeman. Mr Freeman says he relied upon Mr Miles’ advice for these misleading answers to these statutory notices. What the court wants to know is whether Mr Freeman’s assertion that he relied upon legal advice to produce these misleading answers or not is right or is wrong. 
        
       
      
    27 In ruling on a later objection to the admissibility of further questions I said: 
     
      
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: I’d like to know what really happened and where the truth lies. I’d like to know whether your client is lying when he said that he relied upon legal advice to prepare the misleading responses that he did. I want to know everything I possibly can about this case. 
        
       
      
    28 I have set out at length the circumstances in which the statements said to amount to an impression of bias arose. As I earlier indicated, the defendant has focused on the statements made by me in which I described the answers to the statutory notices as “misleading”. 
     
      
    29 Mr Hemmings submits that this amounts to an indication of prejudgment and a fair-minded lay observer might reasonably apprehend that I might not bring an impartial and unprejudiced mind to the resolution of the issues in the case.The Relevant Law30 The test for determining whether or not there is apprehended bias is correctly stated by Mr Hemmings. It had been re-stated in many cases, for example, most recently in Johnson v Johnson (2000) 201 CLR 485 at [11], Ebner v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy (2000) 205 CLR 337 at [6]-[8], Antoun v The Queen at [1]. 
     
      
    31 In Johnson, however, the Court (Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow and Haynes JJ) went on to say at [12] that the hypothetical reasonable observer of the judge’s conduct is postulated in order to emphasise that the test is objective. The Court said: 
     
      
       
        
        At the same time, two things need to be remembered: the observer is taken to be reasonable; and the person being observed is “a professional judge whose training, tradition and oath or affirmation require [the judge] to discard the irrelevant, the immaterial and the prejudicial (citing  
        Vakauta v Kelly  
        at 527 per McHugh JA). 
        
       
      
    32 In Johnson the Court went on to say (at [13]): 
     
      
       
        
        While the fictional observer, by reference to whom the test is formulated, is not to be assumed to have a detailed knowledge of the law, or of the character or ability of a particular judge, the reasonableness of any suggested apprehension of bias is to be considered in the context of ordinary judicial practice. The rules and conventions governing such practice are not frozen in time. They develop to take account of the exigencies of modern litigation. At the trial level, modern judges, responding to a need for more active case management, intervene in the conduct of cases to an extent that may surprise a person who came to court expecting a judge to remain, until the moment of pronouncement of judgment, as inscrutable as the Sphinx. 
        
       
        
      
    33 The Court went on to note that judges “are not expected to wait until the end of a case before they start thinking about the issues, or to sit mute while evidence is advanced and arguments are presented”. 
     
      
    34 In the same case Kirby J said (at [46]): 
     
      
       
        
        Whatever may have been the tradition in earlier times, opinions favouring silence on the part of an adjudicator during a hearing [ 
        Watson 
         (1976) 136 CLR 248 at 294; 9 ALR 551 per Jacobs J] (which is the surest means of avoiding most allegations of prejudgment) are now seen as carrying risks of an even greater injustice [ 
        Vakauta v Kelly 
         (1989) 167 CLR 568 at 571]. Unless the adjudicator exposes the trend of his or her thinking, a party may be effectively denied justice because that party does not adduce evidence or present argument that could have settled the adjudicator's undisclosed concerns. A frank dialogue will commonly be conducive to the avoidance of oversight and the repair of misapprehensions. Uninformed members of the public are doubtless sometimes surprised by the robust exchanges which take place in court, especially between a judge and experienced lawyers. But judges and other adjudicators and lawyers know that such dialogue can have great value. 
        
       
      
    35 In Vakauta v Kelly, to which Kirby J referred, the Court (Brennan, Deane and Gaudron JJ) said (at 571): 
     
      
       
        
        It seems to us that a trial judge who made necessary rulings but otherwise sat completely silent throughout a non-jury trial with the result that his or her views about the issues, problems and technical difficulties involved in the case remained unknown until they emerged as final conclusions in his or her judgment would not represent a model to be emulated. 
        
       
      
    36 In Antoun, Kirby J said (at [27]): 
     
      
       
        
        So far as the first point is concerned, it is certainly true that the trial judge’s remarks were strong and forthright. In some circumstances, that will be a permissible expression to adopt, especially where the trial judge is conducting a trial as the sole judge of fact and law and the parties are legally represented by counsel able to respond with clarity and forthrightness. Judicial indignation at a particular course of action, or proposed action, may on occasion be understandable. 
        22 
         Couched appropriately, at the proper time and in due sequence, it may give rise to no reasonable apprehension of bias. For centuries in courts of our tradition, judges have been telling parties and their lawyers, sometimes in quite robust terms, that they consider that a particular submission or course of action is hopeless, a waste of the court’s time or doomed to fail. I would not want to say anything that needlessly mollycoddled candid judicial speech addressed to trained advocates. 
        
       
      
    37 As counsel who involved in this case are aware, it has always been my practice to avoid being Sphinx-like and to express my thinking about the case or about the evidence, often quite forcefully. It is better that I should do so rather then unexpectedly spring it on the parties for the first and only time in a reserved judgment. The practice has the benefit of affording an opportunity to counsel, if they wish, to persuade me to an opposite view. 
     
      
    38 The cases are also full of warnings against trial judges accepting too readily submissions that they should disqualify themselves on an appearance of bias. 
     
      
    39 In an earlier case Re Lusink; Ex parte Shaw (1980) 32 ALR 47, Murphy J said (at 53): 
     
      
       
        
        The judicial process is quite opposed to the idea that a judge forms no impression until the very last word before judgment. On the contrary, one side begins by introducing arguments or evidence intended to create a provisional view in its favour, and often succeeds. The other side seeks to reverse the process by cross-examination and then presenting its case. The extent to which any impression is formed depends upon the strength of the evidence and the conduct of the case up until that point.  
        
       
      
    40 Re Lusink involved an application for a writ of prohibition which had been sought against the trial judge. In refusing the application Gibbs ACJ said (at 50): 
     
      
       
        
        Of course, the court which is asked to grant prohibition will not lightly conclude that the judge may reasonably be suspected of bias in this sense; it must be “firmly established” that such a suspicion may reasonably be engendered in the minds of the parties or the public… 
        
       
      
    41 In Re JRL; Ex parte CJL (1986) 161 CLR 324 at 351, Mason J said that this kind of disqualification is only made out by showing that there is a reasonable apprehension of bias by prejudgment, and this must be firmly established. His Honour went on to say: 
     
      
      
       
        
        Although it is important that justice must be seen to be done, it is equally important that judicial officers discharge their duty to sit and do not, by acceding too readily to suggestions of appearance of bias, encourage parties to believe that by seeking the disqualification of a judge, they will have their case tried by someone thought to be more likely to decide the case in their favour. 
        
       
      
    42 In Johnson, Kirby J referred to Re JRL (at [45]): 
     
      
       
        
        Such considerations lay behind the salutary warning given in  
        Re JRL; Ex parte CJL 
         that judicial officers in Australia were obliged to discharge their professional duties unless disqualified by law. They were told not to accede too readily to suggestions of an appearance of bias, lest parties be encouraged to seek such disqualification without justification. Applications of that kind might sometimes be made in the hope of securing an adjudicator more sympathetic to a party's cause. Or they might be made because of the strategic advantage that may thereby be secured, especially the interruption of lengthy proceedings and the delays consequent upon obtaining a fresh start in a busy court or tribunal. 
        
       
       
      
    Conclusion43 The test of reasonable apprehension of bias must be viewed from the position of the hypothetical lay observer, fully informed of the evidence and the circumstances in which the statements were made and having an understanding of way in which modern litigation is conducted. As noted in Johnson the test is an objective one and involves a test of reasonableness. 
     
      
    44 It is to be noted that the defendant himself in the cross-examination to which I have referred, conceded at least in relation to the second statutory notice that the statement in his letter responding to that notice, that there are no documents, would appear to be untrue.45 I have referred to the defendant’s evidence in which he said that he had prepared the REF and that in doing so he had referred to (and, I infer, relied upon) the ecological reports that he had. If, as is the fact, the defendant’s responses to the statutory notices stated that there are no documents when it is also the fact that there were relevant documents, then the responses that he forwarded were clearly wrong. It is self-evident that if they were wrong they were also misleading. They were misleading because they would mislead the reader into believing, contrary to the facts, that there were no documents. This conclusion is plainly self-evident. It does not give rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias or an appearance to the fair-minded lay observer that I might not bring an impartial and unprejudiced mind to the resolution of the issues in this case. 
     
      
    46 In my opinion, the fair-minded hypothetical observer acting reasonably would not conclude that I am unable to bring an impartial and unprejudiced mind to the issues in this case or otherwise decide the case on its merits. Moreover, in applying the principles explained in Re Lusink, in Re JRL and in Johnson, that the ground for disqualification must be firmly established and that judges should not accede too readily to suggestions of appearance of bias, lead me to conclude that the defendant’s notice of motion must be dismissed. Although not a reason for dismissing the motion, I note that this is the fifteenth day of this case and there will obviously be large costs in both monetary terms and court-hearing time if the case were to start against before another judge. 
     
      
    47 In conclusion, the alternative to what I did would have been to sit Sphinx-like, keeping my thoughts to myself, not disclosing them to the parties and springing then unannounced upon the parties at the moment of final judgment. I am sure that most defendants would prefer to know my thoughts before final judgment so that they could be met in the course of submissions.  
     
      
    48 In the present case it remains open, of course, to Mr Hemmings to argue that the responses to the statutory notices furnished by the defendant in this case were not misleading and I look forward with interest to hearing his submissions in that respect in due course.49 The defendant’s notice of motion is dismissed. The hearing will continue.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 SULLY J: I agree with Bell J. 
     
      
    2 BELL J: On 17 August 2006 Alysha Sheen was convicted at trial of the offence of knowingly take part in the manufacture of a prohibited drug (methylamphetamine) in an amount not less than the commercial quantity. She was sentenced in the District Court at Tamworth on 24 August 2006 to a non-parole period of 18 months’ imprisonment with a balance of term of six months. This sentence was wholly suspended pursuant to s 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 on condition she enter into a bond to be of good behaviour for two years.  
     
      
    3 Alysha Sheen appeals against conviction. The Crown appeals against sentence, asserting its manifest inadequacy. The two appeals were heard together. In view of the order I propose on the conviction appeal, it is not necessary to deal with the Crown appeal.  
     
      
       
      The facts  
       
      
    4 The facts on which the Crown relied at trial can be summarised as follows. The appellant and her defacto partner, Todd Tochel, were the joint lessees of premises located at 88 Phillip Street, Carroll. They had been residing at the premises for 12 months at the date of these events. Just before 2.00 am on 1 October 2003 the police executed a search warrant on the premises. At the time the police entered the house the appellant, Todd Tochel and a man named Simon Daher were awake and seated in the lounge room. There was an acrid chemical smell inside the house. In the master bedroom liquid (later analysed and found to be methylamphetamine) was heating in a five-litre reaction flask. Other glassware and chemicals associated with the manufacture of methylamphetamine were found in the bedroom. The appellant’s two young children were asleep in two other bedrooms in the house. 
     
      
    5 The police commenced surveillance of the premises late on 30 September. Two cars containing at least four persons were observed arriving at the premises at around 10.00 pm. A woman (who it was open to find was the appellant) came out of the house and appeared to greet the occupants of the cars. There was considerable activity involving persons moving between the premises and adjacent premises at 82 Phillip Street. Two men carried boxes from a shed into the house. Another box was carried into the house from the car in which Simon Daher had arrived at the premises.  
     
      
    6 A police officer spoke with the appellant shortly after the execution of the search warrant. The appellant told the police that she had been living in the premises for about 12 months. She said that Simon Daher had arrived the previous day, and that she had been busy with the children and was not able to say at what time he arrived. She said that she was asleep in the lounge room at the time the police arrived. She denied knowledge of the drug laboratory and said that she was not responsible for it. She said that she had not smelled the chemicals.  
     
      
    7 Todd Tochel gave evidence in the Crown case. He had earlier pleaded guilty to the offence of manufacturing not less than the commercial quantity of methylamphetamine arising out of these events. Simon Daher had also pleaded guilty to the same offence. Mr Tochel said that he and the appellant were the joint lessees of the premises. He said that the drug manufacture had commenced about one hour prior to the arrival of the police. The appellant had been asleep on the lounge at the time the police arrived and she had not taken part in the manufacture of the drug.  
     
      
      The trial 
      
    8 The appellant was arraigned on an indictment that charged her in count 1 that between 29 September and 2 October 2003 at Carroll she had manufactured a prohibited drug (methylamphetamine) in an amount not less than the commercial quantity for that drug and, in the alternative, that between the same dates and at the same place she did knowingly take part in the manufacture of a prohibited drug (methylamphetamine) in an amount not less than the commercial quantity for that drug. Each count is an offence contrary to s 24(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. 
     
      
    9 At the close of the Crown case the Judge directed a verdict of acquittal in respect of the first count.  
     
      
    10 The Crown case in support of the second count was that the appellant had knowingly taken part in the manufacture of the drug in that she had suffered or permitted a step in the manufacturing process to be taken in premises of which she was the lessee/occupier. 
     
      
    11 Section 6 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act (the “DMTA”) provides: 
     
      
       
        
        6. For the purposes of this Act and the regulations, a person takes part in the … manufacture … of a prohibited drug if:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) the person takes, or participates in, any step, or causes any step to be taken, in the process of that … manufacture … 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          …  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) the person … suffers or permits any such step in that process to be taken in premises of which the person is … lessee or occupier … . 
          
         
        
       
      
    12 The focus at trial was on the Crown’s ability to prove the appellant’s awareness of the manufacturing process. There was an issue concerning whether the appellant was awake at the time the police executed the warrant and whether any person present in the house would have been conscious of the acrid chemical smell. 
     
      
    13 The Judge summed up to the jury directing them with respect to the elements of the offence as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        The element of knowingly take part in the manufacture of a prohibited drug has some further definition. At law a person takes part in the manufacture of a prohibited drug by doing one or more of three things. The first is that the person takes part, or participates in any step, or causes any step to be taken in the process of that manufacture. The second way that a person can take part in the manufacture of a prohibited drug is not really relevant in this trial, but I will tell you that it is a person who provides or arranges finance for any such step in the process of manufacture.  
        
       
       
        
        The third way in which a person can take part in the manufacture of a prohibited drug is if the person provides the premises in which any step in the process of manufacture is taken, or suffers or permits any step in that process to be taken in the premises of which the person is the owner, lessee, or occupier. 
        
       
       
        
        The Crown must prove also that the accused did that knowingly, that is allowed her premises to be used for the manufacture of a prohibited drug knowing that the process involved the manufacture of a prohibited drug. Knowledge alone is not enough, there have to be the two elements proved by the Crown, that is the taking part in the way that is alleged, by allowing the premises to be used for the manufacturing process, and doing so knowingly. And it has to be the knowledge of Miss Sheen which is proved beyond reasonable doubt, not the knowledge of some hypothetical person in her circumstances. It must be her knowledge that you must be satisfied of (SU 4-5). 
        
       
      
    14 The Judge summarised the way the parties put their respective cases in the following way: 
     
      
       
        
        The Crown asks you on the basis of the evidence it has produced here to find that Miss Sheen was knowingly taking part in the manufacture of the methylamphetamine in that she was allowing the manufacturing process to be conducted in premises in which she was living and she knew that what was being manufactured was a prohibited drug and the Crown asks you to conclude that on the basis of the location of the lab in the bedroom, what he says is Miss Sheen’s close proximity to it in the lounge room, that she was awake at the time, and the chemical smell in and outside the house.  
        
       
       
        
        On behalf of the accused it is submitted to you that Mr Tochel has taken responsibility for the manufacture of the drug with Mr Daher and that Miss Sheen was not a participant and was not aware and that there are a number of factors in the evidence which would support that, they being that the glassware and other materials were brought into the house in closed boxes when Mr Daher arrived. Mr Tochel’s evidence that he could not smell the fumes in the lounge room, Mr Tochel’s evidence that Miss Sheen was asleep in the lounge room and Miss Sheen’s denials of knowledge, or taking part in the manufacture, in her conversation with Detective Gregory (SU 12-13). 
        
       
      
    15 The summing up reflected the way in which the issues had been developed by the parties. There was no application for any redirection by counsel who appeared on the appellant’s behalf at trial.  
     
      
    16 The appellant seeks leave to rely on the following three grounds of appeal: 
     
      
       
        
        1. Her Honour erred in her summing up by not assisting the jury as to what is meant by the words “suffered or permitted” the manufacturing process to have occurred. 
        
       
       
        
        2. Her Honour erred in not instructing the jury that to merely be aware an activity is occurring does not in itself constitute “suffering” or “permitting” any step of the manufacturing process to have occurred as there is also a required element of failing to exercise a power or right to prevent it.  
        
       
       
        
        3. Her Honour erred in not instructing the jury that if they found as a fact that the applicant could not have done anything to prevent the manufacturing process from occurring that she should be found not guilty.  
        
       
      
    17 Ground 2 is a refinement of the complaint made in ground 1 and it is convenient to deal with these two grounds together. Counsel submitted that it was necessary to show that the appellant had some right or capacity to prevent the activity in order to establish that she suffered or permitted a step in the process of manufacture of the drug to take place in the premises of which she was the occupier/lessee. Counsel relied on the decisions of this Court in R v Lonie & Groom [1999] NSWCCA 319 and R v Jasper [2003] NSWCCA 186; 139 A Crim R 329 in support of this contention.  
     
      
    18 Before turning to these cases it is useful to refer to the decision of the Queensland Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Sanewski [1987] 1 Qd R 374. In that case the Court considered the meaning of suffering premises to be used for the smoking of a dangerous drug contrary to s 130(2)(e) of the Health Act 1937-1984 (Qld). Kelly SPJ (with whose judgment Matthews J agreed) concluded, after a review of a number of English, New Zealand and South Australian authorities (at 378):  
     
      
       
        
        After consideration of this diversity of judicial views, I have reached the conclusion that when, as in the statute with which we are here concerned, the words “permit” and “suffer” are used there is some degree of difference between them, “suffer” being somewhat less positive than “permit” and is to be interpreted as meaning passively or implicitly allowing the act in question to take place as distinct from actively or expressly allowing it. The word imports knowingly allowing something to happen that the person concerned could have prevented.  
        
       
       
      Shepherdson J observed (at 379-380): 
       
       
        
        I agree with Kelly SPJ that in s 130(2)(e) of the Health Act “suffer” is somewhat less positive than “permit” and is to be interpreted as meaning passively or implicitly allowing the act in question to take place as distinct from actively or expressly allowing it. If a person actively or expressly allows the act to occur he permits it. 
        
       
       
        
        However, with respect I have difficulty in agreeing that “suffer” imports knowingly allowing something to happen which the person concerned could have prevented. In my opinion, the use of the phrase “knowingly allow” takes the matter too close to “permit” and tends to obliterate the distinction between “permit” and “suffer”. I agree that in “suffer” there is an element of awareness of the act in question occurring as well as an element of failing to prevent the occurrence of the act by the person concerned. I would add the element of prevention only arises if the person does not exercise a power which he or she has or a right to stop the occurrence.  
        
       
      
     19 In Jasper this Court dealt with an appeal by the Crown under s 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 against a decision to permanently stay counts in an indictment on the ground that their prosecution was foredoomed to fail. It was the Crown case that the respondent, a corrupt policeman, suffered or permitted another to supply drugs by allowing that other, a drug supplier, to continue to deal in drugs in return for the payment of bribe monies. The primary judge held that the respondent did not have the power to prevent in advance any given offence. In granting the stay the primary judge expressed the opinion that, in the context of s 6 of the DMTA, no meaningful distinction was to be drawn between suffering and permitting. Mason P (with whose judgment the other members of the court concurred) held that the primary judge had taken too narrow a view of the concept of suffering for the purposes of the DMTA. His Honour considered the use of both words to point against complete identity of meaning. He favoured the reasoning of Kelly SPJ and Sheperdson J in R v Sanewski, that suffers, when juxtaposed with permits, carries a more passive connotation. His Honour said (at [23]): 
     
      
       
        
        A person does not suffer or permit conduct over which he or she has no control or of which he or she is ignorant. For a person to “permit” or “suffer” another to sell and distribute etc prohibited drugs requires more than an awareness of the act in question. I agree with Shepherdson J in Sanewski who said (at 380): 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
          
          …In “suffer” there is an element of awareness of the act in question occurring as well as an element of failing to prevent the the occurrence of the act by the person concerned. I would add that the element of prevention arises only if the person concerned does not exercise a power which he or she has to stop the occurrence.  
          
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
      His Honour commented that several of the cases point to the need to show that the offender had the power or capacity to stop another’s known misconduct and, in this context, to observe that occupation of premises can establish that right or power (at [26]). His Honour went on to observe (at [27]): 
      
     
     
      
       
        
        The critical point is the legal capacity to control a situation and the failure to do so with the requisite state of mind.  
        
       
      
    20 The Crown did not submit on the hearing of the appeal that proof of some power or capacity to prevent the manufacture was not required. In the Crown Prosecutor’s submission the Judge’s directions to the jury made this much clear. Her Honour instructed the jury that mere knowledge of the manufacturing process was insufficient and that it was necessary for the Crown to prove that the appellant allowed her premises to be used for the purpose of manufacture of the drug. In the Crown’s submission the verb to allow is readily understood. It was submitted that the jury would have taken from the directions that the Crown had to prove that the appellant had some right or capacity to prevent the manufacture of the drugs and that she had chosen not to exercise it.21 The fact of occupation, when combined with knowledge that drugs are being manufactured within the premises, may readily support an inference that the occupier at the least suffered the manufacturing process to take place. In this case the appellant and her de facto husband were joint lessees of the premises, which was their de facto matrimonial home. Todd Tochel had the legal right to (i) be present in the premises; (ii) bring things into the premises; and (iii) invite persons into the premises. It is not apparent what power or capacity the appellant had to prevent Tochel from inviting Daher onto the premises or to prevent the two of them from manufacturing drugs inside the premises. 22 In Lonie & Groom a quantity of cannabis was found in premises at Somersby leased by Groom who was living in a de facto relationship with Lonie and sharing the house with her. Smart AJ (with whose judgment the other members of the Court concurred) said this:  
     
      
       
        
        [97] Proceeding, as the Court must on the basis that Groom knew that there were substantial quantities of cannabis in the house, the evidence does not disclose the circumstances in which it was brought into the house and how long it had been there. There is often not a lot a wife or de facto wife can do if a husband or de facto husband brings prohibited drugs onto premises. Groom has not been charged for her failure to report Lonie's offence (or offences) to the police. The evidence does not disclose whether Lonie brought the cannabis on to the premises and she became aware of it later and was presented with a fait accompli. Nor does the evidence disclose whether the cannabis was brought on to the premises at the one time or gradually over an extended period or on a number of days.  
         
         
        [98] The matter should be approached on a twofold basis. In the case of a couple living together as man and wife and sharing the rent with the de facto wife in poor health and on a disability pension it is artificial just because the lease is in her name to talk of her having any power to give the de facto husband directions as to what he was to do. Nor is it at all clear that she could legally do so especially if the lease was held in her name on behalf of both of them. For example, it is not easy to envisage a husband being able to evict his wife from the matrimonial home of which he was the lessee if she brought some prohibited drugs on to the premises.  
        
       
      
    23 In the Crown’s submission the fact that the manufacture was taking place in the bedroom was significant. This was a circumstance that was said to be capable of supporting the inference that the appellant suffered or permitted the manufacture to continue because she might be expected to have control over the use of the matrimonial bedroom. The Crown Prosecutor contended that the absence of any request for further directions suggested that in the atmosphere of the trial no further direction was needed. 24 Before dealing with the latter submission I shall refer in more detail to the way the parties identified the issues at trial. The Crown Prosecutor opened his case telling the jury that “the accused either manufactured with the other two or knowingly took part in the manufacture, that is by allowing the premises in which she had an interest to be used for that purpose knowing it was going on (T 14/08/06 7.33-41)”. The Crown Prosecutor did not identify the facts and circumstances from which the inference of the appellant’s power or capacity to prevent Tochel making use of the premises, which they jointly leased, to manufacture drugs was to be drawn. 25 In his closing address the Crown Prosecutor placed emphasis on the unlikelihood that the appellant did not know of the manufacturing process. He put it this way: 
     
      
       
        
        Now as I said to you the other day, the meaning of taking part in includes a person that provides a premises in which any such step in that process is taken, or suffers or permits any step in that process to be taken in premises at which that person is the owner, lessee or occupier or in the management at which the person participates. Now, the clear and unequivocal evidence here is that this accused, Alysha Sheen is an occupier of those premises and I’d suggest to you straight up, it’s an affront to common sense to say that she didn’t know what was going on. It’s an affront to common sense to say that she would try to do something about it because what she says to Detective Gregory on the night is, “I didn’t know there was a drug laboratory going in there”. Despite the fact that the police have their breathing apparatus on, there’s a very, very strong smell (T 17/08/06 12.16-26) 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        What I’d say to you is that it just defies common sense that Alysha Sheen didn’t know what was going on. Put yourself in the position, a number of you are probably married, or have partners, somebody turns up 10.00 o’clock at night, carries stuff into the house and says, “Oh sorry, you can’t sleep in the bedroom tonight, something’s going to happen in there”. You wouldn’t say anything about that, wouldn’t ask “what’s going on? Why is it happening? What are you going to do about it?” now that’s what the defence ask you to believe, that she didn’t know anything about what was happening. Her house, her bedroom do nothing. As I said it justifies (sic) (just defies), common sense. She clearly knew what was happening. She clearly knew what was happening was being done for a reason late at night, in a semi-rural setting and she clearly knew it was happening on (sic) (in) her house in her bedroom. 
        
       
      
    26 Defence counsel’s closing address was focussed wholly on the question of proof of the appellant’s knowledge of the manufacture. Counsel concluded by saying this: 
     
      
       
        
        Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, there is nothing but doubt in relation to this charge against Alysha. You will see that the circumstances of the case indicate that she had no knowledge of it. It’s the prosecution that must prove that she had knowledge of what was going on in the premises. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, there is no evidence to convict this person. You should bring back a verdict of “not guilty”. Thank you. (T 17/08/06 19.41-48). 
        
       
      
    27 It seems to me to be an inescapable conclusion that defence counsel did not seek any further direction concerning the element of suffering or permitting for the purposes of s 6 of the DMTA because he did not turn his mind to it; the trial was conducted by both parties on the basis that knowledge was the sole issue. 28 In a case in which a joint tenant/occupier of premises is alleged to have suffered or permitted a step in the process of manufacture to take place it may be that the inference of guilt can be drawn from circumstances including that, over a period of time, no step was taken to prevent a joint occupier/tenant from continuing the process of manufacture. That is not this case. 
     
      
    29 The premises were a semi-rural property at which the appellant was living with Tochel and their two infant children. There was no evidence that any step in the manufacture began until after 10.00pm on 30 September. The police executed the search warrant at around 1.50am the following morning. The case against the appellant was circumstantial. No attention was given to the question of what, if any, evidence was capable of excluding the reasonable possibility that the appellant did not have the power or capacity to prevent the manufacture of the drugs over this period of a few hours in the middle of the night.30 The Judge instructed the jury that mere knowledge was not sufficient and it was necessary for the Crown to establish that the appellant allowed her premises to be used for the manufacture of the drug, however, to my mind the directions were insufficient. They did not serve to convey that it was necessary to prove that the appellant had any power or capacity to prevent the manufacture of the drugs in the premises of which Todd Tochel (who was the manufacturer) was a joint lessee/occupier. There is a real risk the jury may have reasoned towards a finding of guilt once they rejected the appellant’s case that she was unaware of the activity.  
     
      
    31 The appellant requires leave to rely on each of her grounds of appeal under r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules. In my opinion the omission to direct the jury that suffering or permitting required proof that the appellant possessed the power or capacity to prevent the manufacture and that knowing it was taking place she failed to do so has occasioned a miscarriage of justice and for that reason I would grant leave to rely on grounds 1 and 2. In the circumstances it is not necessary to deal with ground 3, although, had such a direction been sought, in my opinion, it should have been given.  
     
      
    32 None of the grounds of appeal raised the sufficiency of the evidence to support the appellant’s conviction. The Court was thus not called upon to consider the evidence in order to determine whether it would have been open to a properly instructed jury to convict the appellant. In these circumstances I would allow the appeal but order a new trial.  
     
      
    33 For these reasons the orders that I propose are: 
     
      
       
        
        1. Grant leave to rely on grounds 1 and 2;  
        
       
       
        
        2. Allow the appeal and quash the conviction and sentence; 
        
       
       
        
        2. Direct a new trial on count 2; 
        
       
       
        
        3. Dismiss the Crown appeal.  
        
       
      
    34 HOEBEN J: I agree with Bell J.

    JUDGMENTSENTENCE1 HIS HONOUR: The prisoner, Shayne Robert Wilkins, appears today for sentence in relation to four charges to which he pleaded guilty at the Local Court. The four charges are firstly that he, between 27 November and 16 December 2005 at Wagga Wagga in the State of New South Wales, did, on three or more separate occasions during a period of thirty consecutive days, supply a prohibited drug other than cannabis, to wit, N,N-dimethylamphetamine (common known as “speed”) for financial or material reward. This is an offence brought pursuant to s 25A(1) Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 and carries a maximum penalty of twenty years imprisonment. 2 The second charge in time to which he pleaded guilty is another offence pursuant to s 25A(1) alleging ongoing supply of methylamphetamine between 20 January 2006 and 4 February 2006. 3 The third charge in time is an allegation that the prisoner, on 13 April 2006 at Kooringal in the State of New South Wales did agree to supply an amount of a prohibited drug, to wit, 2,000 ecstasy tablets, being an amount which is not less than the commercial quantity applicable to that prohibited drug. That offence brought pursuant to s 25(2) Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 carries a maximum penalty of twenty years imprisonment. 4 Further, the prisoner pleaded guilty to a charge alleging that he, on 19 April 2006 at Kooringal, did supply a prohibited drug, to wit, “4 ounces of amphetamine”. This is an offence brought pursuant to s 25(1) Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act and carries a maximum penalty of fifteen years imprisonment. The quantity of the drug supplied is more specifically identified in the statement of facts. 5 The prisoner also requests that I take into account three matters on a Form One. The Crown has asked that I take them into account in relation to the second charge in time to which the prisoner has pleaded guilty. That offence will be hereinafter referred to as the principal offence. The three offences on the Form One include, firstly, an allegation on 23 March 2006 the prisoner did supply 23.8 grams of methylamphetamine; secondly, that he on 3 April 2006 did supply a prohibited drug which was held out to be 7 grams of methylamphetamine but analysed as 6.23 grams of methylamphetamine and 3.68 grams of MDMA, if I might shortly call it that. And the third charge alleges that between 1 February 2006 and 19 April 2006 the prisoner was involved in ongoing supply of the prohibited drug amphetamine. These offences will be taken into account in relation to the principal offence. 6 The prisoner was arrested on 19 April 2006 and has been in custody since that time. I have noted, as the transcript would in due course reveal, that the prisoner, on 16 August 2006, was convicted of the charge of driving whilst disqualified from holding a motor vehicle drivers licence. For this offence he was charged on 20 April 2006 and it would, although I do not have the facts available to me, that that offence was one committed in the observation of the undercover police officer with whom the prisoner dealt or under police surveillance, and has some “peripheral” connection to the current offences.7 On 16 August 2006 the prisoner was sentenced to a non-parole period of six months imprisonment with a balance of sentence of six months. That sentence dated from the date the prisoner came into custody. I am of the view, therefore, in relation to the sentences I will impose, some of which will be partly concurrent but partly accumulative with others, that the first of the sentences in time should commence at the expiration of the non-parole period fixed by the learned Magistrate, which on my understanding is 19 October 2006. This, of course, has the effect of distorting the relationship of the non-parole period I would ordinarily fix with the balance of the sentence. And as I foreshadowed that the sentences will be partly concurrent and partly accumulative with others, that in itself constitutes a special circumstance warranting an adjustment of the relevant non-parole period on the last sentence to be imposed. 8 That having been said, I must factor into that calculation the six months term of imprisonment imposed by the Magistrate upon which any sentences I impose are cumulative, which is a further relevant consideration to “special circumstances” (s 44 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999). I have indicated in the course of submissions and confirm at this point that further, there are other matters that constitute special circumstances that warrant an adjustment of the relevant non-parole period. Ultimately the non-parole period I will fix will be approximately, on my very rough calculation, two-thirds or thereabouts of the total sentence imposed, including, as I understand it, the six month sentence upon which any sentences I impose are cumulative.9 The facts of the matter are set out in a statement of facts which, as I understand it, is an agreed statement of facts of some length. This statement of facts deals with both the counts to which the prisoner has pleaded guilty at the Local Court, and continued his plea of guilty in this court, and also contains details in relation to the matters on the Form One. The statement of facts gives a total picture, as I would understand it, of the prisoner’s criminality over a period of time, taken in conjunction, of course, with his own evidence on the subject. 10 Before I turn to the facts and give a short summary of them, I also note that two co-accused, Christopher Norton and Jed Stockton, were sentenced by his Honour Judge Charteris S.C. on 6 December 2006. Although it would appear that his Honour heard the submissions in relation to those two prisoners prior to the remarks on sentences, as I would understand it, in what order I do not know, his Honour sentenced both prisoners at separate occasions on that particular date. Apparently one in the morning, one in the afternoon. It should be pointed out that Mr Norton pleaded guilty to three charges, the last two in time were charges identical, as I understand it, to the third and fourth charges to which this prisoner has pleaded guilty.11 Mr Norton pleaded guilty to two charges. Those two charges were identical, as I understand it, to the third and fourth charges to which this prisoner has pleaded guilty. I have taken into account his Honour’s remarks on sentence; they are relevant to the sentencing of this particular offender. To some extent they may constrain the appropriate exercise of discretion in accordance with the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Tisalandis (1982) 2 NSWLR 430. However, strict parity does not arise in relation to the sentencing of this offender because, firstly, the offences committed by this offender have to be seen in the context of the other offending revealed in the first two charges to which he pleaded guilty and in the Form One matters. Furthermore, the prisoner’s record was significantly more serious than that of either Mr Stockton or Mr Norton. 12 Mr Norton was aged approximately twenty-five years of age at the time of the commission of the offences; Mr Stockton was aged nineteen years of age. Neither of their criminal histories, as I say, go anywhere near matching this prisoner. This prisoner had previously been in gaol on several occasions; neither of those men had been gaol. I note, relevantly, that the prisoner at the time of the commission of the offences would have been twenty-eight years, about to turn twenty-nine years, and thus was somewhat older. I will deal with their relationship with one another when I deal with the facts.13 These charges arise out of an operation commenced in November 2005. That operation started off being known as Operation Surfboard and was changed to Operation Boiling. The names of the operations are not important other than to stress the fact that this prisoner was targeted by police and their investigations revealed firstly, in respect of the first charge to which the prisoner pleaded guilty, that he on three separate occasions, that is, on 26 November 2005, 10 December 2005, and 16 December 2005, provided an undercover police officer on three separate occasions with what was understood to be “speed” on each occasion for the sum of $100. The quantities on each occasion weighed 0.25 grams. The purity was very high indeed, between 80.5 and 83.5 per cent. It would appear, based on the evidence of the prisoner, that he was unaware of the extremely high purity of the drugs, which is to my mind consistent with the prices he sought for what were described as “three points” of speed on each occasion. That criminality represents what is reflected in count one. 14 In relation to the second charge to which he pleaded guilty the prisoner likewise on 23 January 2006, 1 February 2006, and 4 February 2006, provided what could be described relevantly as small quantities of methylamphetamine for financial reward. On the first occasion he was paid $150 for 0.45 grams of methylamphetamine of a relatively low purity, on the second occasion he was paid $300 for what amounted to 0.88 grams of methylamphetamine of 12.5 per cent purity, and on 4 February 2006 the prisoner was paid $700 for a slightly larger quantity of 2.96 grams of 9.5 per cent purity. The trafficable quantity required for the drug methylamphetamine, as I understand it, is 3 grams. That was the second charge, the principal offence to which I earlier referred.15 The facts reveal supplies by the prisoner on 23 February 2006, which is the first charge on the Form One, where the prisoner handed over 23.8 grams of methylamphetamine of 8.5 per cent purity in exchange for $4,000. This is clearly a more significant supply in an individual sense than the earlier supplies. Discussions were had with the prisoner through March and early April regarding the supply of methylamphetamine. On 3 April 2006 discussions occurred between the prisoner, the undercover agent and a third man regarding the possible sale of half a pound of amphetamine for $30,000. During this exchange the prisoner provided Luke, the undercover officer, with methylamphetamine and an MDMA in exchange for $1200. This, as I understand it, constitutes the second charge on the Form One.16 On 13 April 2006 the undercover agent in company with another undercover agent involved in these investigations discussed with the prisoner, in the presence of Mr Norton, the future sale of amphetamine and ecstasy, and in particular, the supply of 2,000 ecstasy tablets at the price of 1300 or $1500 per thousand tablets. This discussion regarding the supply of the 2,000 ecstasy tablets which occurred in the presence of the prisoner but primarily involved the offer from Norton gives rise to the third charge to which the prisoner has pleaded guilty to in time, being the offence contrary to s 25(2) Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. I point out in relation to that matter, as with the fourth charge in time, that the prisoner was acting as a middle man between the undercover agents and Mr Norton. This is to be understood in the context of the prisoner having demonstrated to the undercover police that he was well capable of supplying prohibited drugs, albeit at that point of time methylamphetamine rather than MDMA. 17 There is no evidence that Mr Norton actually possessed 2,000 ecstasy tablets. Whether Mr Norton, if given the opportunity in due course, could have produced these tablets is a matter of speculation. I note that Mr Norton was sentenced by his Honour Judge Charteris on the basis that Mr Norton did not have the 2,000 ecstasy tablets, but the crime was complete by the offer to supply, in respect of which the prisoner formed part of a joint criminal enterprise by reason of his role as a middle man.18 On 19 April 2006 things escalated in reality when the undercover police, both Luke and Sandra, obtained $66,000 in cash and presented it to the prisoner for inspection as with others at a motel in Wagga. On this occasion Norton and Stockton were present. There was further discussion about the future supply of the 2,000 ecstasy tablets, and also discussion about purchasing 4 ounces of amphetamine for $10,000. What the $66,000 was going to purchase is a little unclear from the facts. On my very rough calculation even if the 2,000 tablets had been produced, at $15,000 per thousand that would have involved $30,000. The amphetamines were to be purchased for $10,000, it left another $26,000 unaccounted for. 19 Be that as it may, it is clear that this very large sum of money was used to demonstrate to the offenders, including this prisoner, that the undercover police were serious about purchasing some drugs. It is clear that Norton and Stockton had access to the 4 ounces which the prisoner at that time did not have. Again he performed the role of the middle man. When the money was shown and further discussions occurred, Norton and Stockton left the room and returned with the 4 ounces of amphetamine which, as I understand the facts presented before Judge Charteris, and as I understand the analyst’s certificate, in fact amounted to a total of 110 grams or 4 ounces of amphetamine as it is particularised in the charge. 20 During the course of these various investigations leading up to this transaction which led to the arrest of both the prisoners, Mr Norton and Mr Stockton, various conversations were intercepted by the use of listening devices, and telephone intercepts were used to intercept conversations. The third charge on the Form One is said to represent that various transactions the prisoner conducted between the various dates that were intercepted by telephone intercepts. 21 It must be said that the courage and the ingenuity of the undercover police is to be recognised. It is well known in law enforcement circles and within judicial circles that the detection of the pernicious trade in drug trafficking is very much dependent upon the courage of these officers which is, on many occasions, unrecognised and unheralded, and for the purposes of the record I believe it is appropriate that I should place on the record the appreciation of the community for the courage that is demonstrated by people such as Luke and Sandra, and the potential danger they face on a daily basis passing themselves off as drug dealers. Of course, having said that, I do not for a moment suggest that this prisoner in any way threatened them or perhaps even presented any danger to them. However, the truth of the matter is the undercover officers themselves are not to know what threat a particular person presents to them should their cover as drug purchasers or dealers be blown.22 In relation to the co-accused, if I might just turn to those persons for one moment, I have already pointed out the common charges relating to Mr Norton and Mr Stockton. Mr Norton was also charged with another charge of supplying fifteen ecstasy tablets, which apparently he had some difficulty obtaining in any event. As I understand the sentences imposed by the learned sentencing judge, ultimately for the offer to supply 2,000 tablets he sentenced Mr Norton and Mr Stockton to six months imprisonment. In relation to the supply of the 4 ounces of amphetamine on 19 April 2006 he sentenced each of those offenders to three years imprisonment. Mr Norton received an additional term of imprisonment for the small quantity of ecstasy tablets. 23 His Honour quite properly made the various sentences partially accumulative upon each other and fixed appropriate non-parole periods for each of the offenders. The ultimate sentences his Honour imposed on the other offenders involved a recognition that the pleas of guilty had been entered at the first reasonable opportunity and thus the prisoners were entitled to the maximum discount for the utilitarian value of those pleas of guilty in accordance with the guideline judgment of Thomson and Houlton. There was no discount in either case for cooperation. Cooperation was not relevant. 24 I have already pointed out that each of these offenders clearly, particularly Mr Norton, had access to some of the drugs in question, the subject of the charges, and facilitated their supply with the assistance of this prisoner as a middle man. It is submitted, and I accept as the case, that this prisoner is to be regarded in an objective sense as equally culpable with each of these offenders. These other offenders, of course, as I pointed out, had lesser records and were younger, particularly Mr Stockton, who was only nineteen years of age. Both offenders were facing their first terms of imprisonment respectively.25 In relation to this particular prisoner his pleas of guilty were entered at the Local Court. They are pleas of guilty that were entered, as I understand it, at the first reasonable opportunity. He is entitled to the maximum discount available pursuant to the guideline judgment for the utilitarian benefit of the pleas of guilty. 26 Furthermore, he has provided cooperation to the authorities set out in material that has been tendered in this court, that I need not dilate upon, as well as giving an undertaking to give evidence in the future in relation to a co-accused who has ultimately pleaded guilty before me in these sittings. I am informed that the prisoner gave a statement in relation to matters upon which he could give evidence in early August 2006. That means that he provided cooperation well before he pleaded guilty to the current charges, or before he was at least sentenced in relation to the current charges. I am also informed that following upon the giving of that statement he attended upon the Local Court and has already given evidence against the person who pleaded guilty before me. Thus can be seen that his cooperation was timely, valuable, significant, and has been underscored, if I can use that expression, by the practical fact that he has actually given evidence. The offer of future assistance would appear to be now unnecessary to be taken up by the prosecution, but that earlier offer of future assistance is relevant to assessing the relevant discount to be applied.27 This matter has been the subject of submission by Mr Weir who has skilfully represented his client’s interests in these proceedings, and has also been the subject of submission by the learned Crown Prosecutor. I have had regard to the judgment that was handed up by Mr Weir, SZ v Regina [2007] NSWCCA 19, particularly the discussion of the application of appropriate discounts by Howie J and Buddin J, and I have noted their remarks. And also earlier decisions of this Court, Sukkar [2006] NSWCCA 92, and of course, El Hani [2004] NSWCCA 162. There are many other judgments, of course, that inform this topic predating these more recent expositions on the subject, such as Cartwright, Gallagher, amongst others, which are significant judgments in this regard.28 Ultimately, to summarise the situation, I understand that it is appropriate to give a combined discount for both the utilitarian benefit of the plea and the cooperation that a discount in excess of 50 per cent would only arise in exceptional circumstances. In any event, a discount of up to 50 per cent for both would require the maximum benefit being given for the utilitarian value of the pleas of guilty as well as significant cooperation, and that is the case here. As I foreshadowed to the accused and the Crown, I propose to accord the prisoner in the context of what is discussed in SZ that a discount of 50 per cent in combination for both matters, which I understand to be the appropriate approach in terms of the practical application of the discount, if not the actual quantification of the discount. That will obviously be calculated on a case by case basis.29 With regard to the prisoner’s background I have a document that the prisoner wrote for my information, which I have read. In that document I have noted his expression of contrition which was confirmed in his evidence before me, and his desire to undertake courses to rehabilitate himself, and particularly, to address a long standing dependence upon methamphetamines. I accept as a fact that the prisoner has been using prohibited drugs, particularly methamphetamines or amphetamines for a lengthy period of time going back over ten years. To some extent this fact is reflected in his criminal history. It is also reflected to some extent in the facts on these charges because at one stage, as I understood the matter, the prisoner in fact injected methamphetamines in the presence of the undercover officer.30 The prisoner is a man who has been seriously injured as a very small child in a house fire. Sadly, his younger sister died in that same incident I am informed, and I have no reason to doubt that. This occurred when he was three. The physical scars of that incident are still with him as he approaches his thirtieth birthday in April. One can see the scarring on his face and I understand he has extensive scarring on his body. This horrendous incident has affected and infected his life ever since, and to some extent may explain his history of offending going back to 1993. Certainly it has placed him in an invidious position in a range of ways. He has been the subject of torment, both physical and mental, caused by the conduct of others. And of course, as he has grown he has had to be subjected to painful surgical treatments. Perhaps further treatments will be required, which not only have affected him physically, but I am sure have had a profound effect upon his mental wellbeing. It would appear on the evidence available to me that in part his dependency upon prohibited drugs stems from the psychological reaction to these deprivations.31 His criminal history, however, does not entitle him to any particular leniency. He has a number of findings of guilt in the Children’s Court for various offences, including offences of dishonesty. He has a conviction for possessing a prohibited drug in 1999 when he would have been, on my very rough calculation, twenty-two. He has a number of drink driving offences. He has convictions of violence, and in fact in May 2004 in the Sydney District Court he was sentenced to eighteen months imprisonment for assault occasioning actual bodily harm with a non-parole period of nine months, which would have concluded, on my very rough calculation, in May 2004. He has thus been subject to parole supervision, he has been previously gaoled also for driving whilst disqualified. He has already been gaoled, as I have pointed out, in relation to another driving whilst disqualified offence committed on or about 19 April 2006.32 He does not have any prior convictions for the supply of drugs but has been previously gaoled, in addition to the matters I have referred to, for other driving offences in 2002 in the Bathurst Local Court.33 The prisoner has given evidence before me that until his last release from gaol he lived in the Bathurst area. He had a relationship with a woman for approximately ten years. On his release from gaol that relationship came to an end. He owned a property in Bathurst which I will assume for the moment was acquired by lawful means. That property was sold, presumably paying out the interest of his partner, and the prisoner purchased a property in Wagga. I accept he’d come to Wagga to start a new life, and I accept that on his release from custody he was able to, for some weeks at least, remain drug free. However, come mid to late 2005, as I understood his evidence, he started using methamphetamines again, and this led ultimately to the circumstances in which the first of the supplies to which he has pleaded guilty occurred. 34 I accept for the purposes of sentencing him that he is a drug user/supplier, but on the other hand I do not accept that he has solely sold drugs, that is, methylamphetamine, for the purposes of obtaining methylamphetamine for himself. Whilst this would be a substantial part of his rationale for being involved in the trade in methylamphetamine his own evidence points to the fact that he has used the money from the sale of drugs for living expenses. In light of the fact that he purchased a property in Wagga before commencing this criminality it could not be said on the evidence available to me that he has acquired significant assets from this criminal conduct, but it has sustained his lifestyle. I accept that the more amphetamine he used the more he needed; the more he needed the more he involved himself in the sale of drugs in the manner as set out in the facts prepared by the prosecution.35 The Probation and Parole Service has prepared a report for the information of the Court, which sets out details relating to his past supervision. In the past his response to supervision has been described as poor and he has been breached in relation to a failure to complete community based orders. The report confirms the matters to which the prisoner referred to in his evidence about the effect upon him of his significant injuries and the deprivations of his upbringing.36 He has been, to his credit, when at large - and he has been at large for most of his adult life, to be fairly said - a very good worker. In fact, he gave evidence before me that he worked as a concreter in Wagga and was anxious to start his own business on his release from custody. True it is he is disqualified for a lengthy period of time, but he believes he can still start such a business. It is a very demanding type of work, concreting, and it would appear that the Probation and Parole Service confirms that the prisoner has always been employed and has never been reliant on unemployment benefits.37 The prisoner confirmed to the Probation and Parole Service that once he started using, it was impossible for him to stop, and that his dependency grew as time wore on. The prisoner would wish to attend upon a rehabilitation program in the wider community such as the Peppers program near Wagga. This, to my mind, will be a matter for the parole authorities. There is no report from Peppers which confirms his suitability for that course but I accept his statement that he would wish to do that program as some evidence of his desire to address the fundamental issues that affect his drug dependence. 38 The Probation and Parole Service have noted the prisoner’s ability to fit into society “as a law abiding citizen” had been blurred by his alcohol and poly substance abuse over many years. He appeared to the Probation and Parole Service to exhibit insight into what were his “crimogenic needs”, and it noted the continuing support of his family, although his family, I assume, live, from what I heard of the evidence, either in Sydney or Bathurst. He has been assessed as suitable for admission into the Peppers Illicit Drug Program according to the Probation and Parole Service in its inquiries, but I have no evidence, as I said, from Peppers itself.39 The Probation and Parole Service does say that the prisoner has been assessed as “unlikely to benefit from supervision from this service” because of “unresolved drug and alcohol issues”. I have very great difficulty understanding this formulation. I would have thought the very purpose of Probation and Parole supervision amongst other things would be to ensure that he did undertake the drug rehabilitation programs that it itself says that he is suitable for. One of the purposes of parole supervision is to assist others to maintain a law abiding lifestyle and to assist offenders who are released from gaol to adjust to community living. This may involve directing those offenders to undertake drug and alcohol counselling and treatment programs. In fact, a major part of the Probation and Parole Service’s work is concerned with this matter. I, for myself, find it difficult to understand, notwithstanding his poor history of supervision in the past, why the prisoner would not benefit from Probation and Parole Service supervision when there is a clear need on the facts of this case for him to have some structure on release and some motivation to address programs that will assist in his rehabilitation. 40 I have concluded, having regard to the totality of the evidence, that, apart from the fact of accumulation providing a special circumstance, there should be some adjustment of the relationship of the relevant non-parole period to the total sentencing imposed to assist in the supervision of the prisoner whilst at large, to direct him in relation to drug and alcohol counselling or treating programs. Also, most importantly, to provide professional guidance to the prisoner to enable him to adjust to community living, which is an important aspect of parole supervision, because those that are just thrown into the streets from gaol with no professional assistance, particularly with backgrounds such as this prisoner, will inevitably find their ways back to gaol sooner rather than later. This cannot possibly be in the community interest.41 That having been said, the adjustment I propose to make is in one respect a marginal adjustment, but it does recognise the need for an extended period of supervision to assist in regard to those matters I have identified.42 In relation to this particular matter, of course, I am taking into account matters on a Form One. Those three matters are very relevant to an assessment of the criminality in the principal offence. They show, for example, that the matters set out in the principal offence are not “one off” offences, that is self-evident in any event, by reference to the first, third and fourth charges, particularly the first and fourth charges. They also show a sustained criminality at a relatively lower level than can be seen from time to time in this Court, and show the prisoner as a person involved in the business of drug supply and not simply supplying for the purposes of his immediate needs insofar as drugs are concerned. This criminality, reflected in the Form One is a matter that requires, in the fixing of an appropriate sentence for the second charge in time, or the principal offence, a greater sentence than would otherwise be appropriate for that offence. 43 The relevance of Form One matters in the sentencing exercise was discussed by the Court of Criminal Appeal in the guideline judgment of that court concerning such matters. Without going into detail in relation to what the learned Chief Justice said on behalf of the Court in that matter, it is clear that when Form One matters, such as these are taken into account in relation to the principal offence, those matters will have the effect of changing the length of the appropriate sentence for the principal offence and will properly provide a context for understanding the criminality reflected in the principal offence. Of course, as the Court of Criminal Appeal said in that judgment, there is no need to quantify the additional penalty to be ascribed to the principal offence by reason of the Form One matters. But in sentencing the prisoner I have had close regard to the terms of that guideline judgment and what the court said about the appropriate approach in circumstances such as this.44 In sentencing the offender I am required to take into account s 3A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, and in this matter there must be both a need to adequately punish the offender to prevent him and others from committing similar offences, promote his rehabilitation, make him accountable, and denounce his conduct as well as recognise the harm that his distribution of drugs would have done to the community. Whether the community needs actual protection from the offender is a little hard to say, but certainly if he wanted to continue in the trade of prohibited drugs then there is an element of protection of the community that would need to be taken into account.45 In relation to s 21A I note, of course, that relevant aggravating and mitigating factors where known to the court do not require necessarily the court to increase or reduce the sentence for the offence. In respect of relevant aggravating factors that arise from this particular matter, I note in relation to the offences that the prisoner was involved in planned criminal activity. It is not suggested that he is part of an organised crime network as such, but it is clear that he was part of a network of people who were involved in the trade of prohibited drugs in the Wagga area.46 I also note that each offence was committed as an offence amongst a series of criminal acts, each of course requiring proper recognition as discussed in, for example, Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610, particularly at para 45. The wording of s 21A(2)(m) is somewhat ambiguously phrased but clearly, of course, I cannot sentence the prisoner in respect of each offence to anything other than the appropriate penalty for each offence. I will do so in accordance with Pearce principles, as will I in calculating accumulation and having regard to the totality of the criminality. The fact is that there is a relationship between the offences, one to the other, in a sense albeit that the offences were committed over a period of time.47 With regard to relevant mitigating factors, it is not open for me to conclude that any damage caused by the offences was not substantial. I have no way of knowing what effect the perpetration of these offences in context had upon the wider community. I know the drugs supplied to the undercover police officers were not provided to others but the prisoner clearly was involved in the trade of drugs and other persons received drugs from him. What damage has been to those persons would be a matter of speculation.48 It is the case the prisoner has pleaded guilty. That requires a discreet recognition as I have earlier outlined. I also note the assistance the prisoner has given to law enforcement authorities as required to be considered as a mitigating factor and as provided for in s 23 of the Act. Unfortunately, it is not a case where I can conclude that the prisoner is unlikely to re-offend or even has good prospects of rehabilitation. His prospects of rehabilitation will be very much dependent upon the attitude he displays on his release from custody. But I do understand and accept at face value the expressions on his part of a willingness to change on release, and a willingness to do things that might assist him to avoid the use of drugs in the future. Given his past history, of course, his prognosis, however, must be fairly said to be problematic. And this is another reason that, in my view, he needs some professional assistance on his release.49 I note in relation to his circumstances that he has been assaulted in prison. He was attacked by a man wielding what appeared to be a sock with a can of baked beans in it. He suffered some superficial injuries to his face as well as some broken teeth. He was called a “dog”, albeit that there is no evidence to suggest that the perpetrator knew as a fact that he, the prisoner, had provided assistance in relation to Mr Cool. But I note that the occurrence was on or about 14 September 2006 and the prisoner had given his statement to police in relation to this matter in early August 2006. Although it is a matter of speculation on my part one might have thought that a prisoner being called out by the police to give a statement or to be spoken to, at least, by them might give some clue to some other persons that he, the prisoner, was providing some assistance in relation to other matters.50 Of course, as to what will happen in the future I do not know because I do not know whether Mr Cool will go to gaol; that is a matter to be determined tomorrow. If Mr Cool does go to gaol, however, I would have thought it was almost certain that the fact that the prisoner had given evidence against Mr Cool would be known in the wider prison community. That having been said, as I indicated to the Crown the hardships of custody arising out of the prisoner’s cooperation, both past and potentially in the future, are matters that are fairly already recognised in the appropriate discount for his cooperation to which I have earlier made reference.51 I also note in the evidence of the prisoner, and in the medical records of the gaol, that the prisoner has been treated in respect of what could be called mental health issues. There is some suggestion that he has been diagnosed in the past with some depression. Whether it is truly major depression I do not know because I do not have a medical report to confirm that. It may well be depression or depressive symptoms reactive to the circumstances of the prisoner being in gaol. The prisoner also says that earlier this year he was diagnosed with a bipolar disorder. I do not have any direct medical evidence of this but the prisoner says, and I am prepared to accept it, that he is currently under medication for the treatment of such a disorder as well as receiving medication for the treatment of depression from time to time.52 I have taken into account his medical condition, as I understand it. This does not appear to offer an explanation for his involvement in the commission of these offences. However, the existence of a pre-existing depression disorder might more readily lead the prisoner to dependency upon prohibited drugs when the opportunity arises because prohibited drugs obviously provide the means of some form of release from one’s reality. I do not have any medical evidence to confirm that bipolar disorder makes anybody more susceptible to drug addiction or drug usage, but I am also prepared to accept that a mental imbalance of that type may lead to the use of medications, be they legally acquired or not to assuage the symptoms of such a condition.53 The sentencing of the offender is a complex issue in some respects. There are many matters to be taken into account, not all of them are capable of precise articulation. I have done the best I can in a very busy list with a great deal of pressure of time upon me to cover the field in an extemporary way. I trust I have done justice to the cases presented by both parties but I have taken into account all that has been put to me on behalf of the accused by Mr Weir. It has been most helpful and all of it has been put to me on behalf of the Crown. 54 Ultimately, in fixing upon the appropriate sentences in these matters I must, with the application of the appropriate discount, ensure that even with the discount there is still recognition of the significance of the criminality of the prisoner to ensure that whilst he does receive the benefit that he is entitled to for the matters that do him credit the sentence he serves does not lead to a term of imprisonment which is totally disproportionate to that criminality to which he has admitted in this court.55 Thus, on the bases of the reasons I have just given, and having regard to the matters that were discussed at the commencement of these sentencing remarks, I will make the following orders.56 Firstly, in relation to the first charge, which is the charge alleging ongoing supply in November/December 2005, I convict the prisoner and I sentence him to a term of imprisonment of one year and three months to commence from 19 October 2006 and to expire on 18 January 2008. I do not fix a non-parole period in relation to that matter for reasons which will be self evident by my other orders.57 In relation to the second charge, that is, the ongoing supply committed in early 2006, January and February 2006, taking into account the three matters on the Form One, I sentence the prisoner to a term of imprisonment of two years and six months. That is to date from 19 July 2007 and to expire on 18 January 2010. That sentence is partly concurrent and partly accumulative to the extent of nine months with the first sentence I impose. Both those sentences involve a 50 per cent discount for the matters I have described.58 For the third charge, that is, the offering to supply the 2,000 tablets of ecstasy committed on or about 13 April 2006, the prisoner is sentenced to six months imprisonment and that term of imprisonment is to date from 19 October 2008 and to expire on 18 April 2009. That sentence is entirely concurrent with the sentence of two years and six months which I have pronounced, but it commences one year into that sentence.59 In relation to the fourth charge, in respect of that matter I fix a sentence by way of non-parole period of nine months to commence from 19 October 2008. That is to expire on 18 July 2009. In respect of that sentence I fix a balance of sentence of one year and nine months which is to expire on 18 April 2011. 60 In light of the structuring of the orders that I have made in relation to this matter it is self-evident that I will be required in respect of the sentence of count two to fix a non-parole period of two years expiring on 19 July 2009. That non-parole period is of course greater than three-quarters of the total sentence but gives effect to the desire that the prisoner be released to parole on 18 July 2009, and also to give effect to the desire to adjust the relationship of the ultimate non-parole period to the total sentence required to be served by the prisoner, including the six months for the drive whilst disqualified matter.61 HIS HONOUR: Now, can I just pause for a moment, Mr Crown? Is there any error or technical difficulty with what I’ve done?62 CORR: No, your Honour, it accords with my calculations.63 HIS HONOUR: So in effect the sentences I have imposed upon the prisoner commence from 19 October 2006 and expire on 18 April 2011. That is a total of four and a half years. The sentences I have imposed involve a non-parole period of two years and nine months, but in effect, the total sentence that the prisoner is subject to is a sentence of five years with a non-parole period of three years and three months if one takes into account the six months I have taken into account imposed by the Magistrate.64 HIS HONOUR: Now, Mr Weir, do you understand that?65 WEIR: Yes your Honour.66 HIS HONOUR: Thank you. And of course the sentences I’ve imposed involve a discount of 50 per cent for the reasons I have given. Mr Wilkins, do you understand the sentences I have imposed?67 OFFENDER: Not really, but Mr Weir will explain.68 HIS HONOUR: Well, the effect is that you’re eligible for parole to be determined by the Parole Board on 18 July 2009. That is two years and four months from now. Do you understand that? You’ll be then subject to a period of parole supervision for a period of one year and nine months. And when you take into account the sentence imposed by the magistrate for the drive whilst disqualified, the total sentence to which you are subject is in effect a sentence of five years with a non-parole period of three years and three months. Because I have to accumulate the sentences I impose upon the six month non-parole period fixed by the Magistrate.69 OFFENDER: I was under the impression that I was refused bail on these charges.70 HIS HONOUR: Yes you were, but you were then sentenced for driving whilst disqualified and sentenced to 12 months with a six month non-parole period for that offence. That offence, whilst connected to these offences, is a separate offence and I can do one of two things. I could make these sentences entirely concurrent with that sentence, which I don’t think is appropriate, or I can accumulate this sentence upon the non-parole period fixed by the Magistrate, and that’s what I’ve chosen to do.71 CORR: The 166 Certificate, the backup charges, if they could be dismissed.72 HIS HONOUR: The backup charges are dismissed pursuant to s 167 of the Criminal Procedure Act. Thank you.73 CORR: And if it hasn’t already been done, your Honour, an order for the destruction of the drugs.74 HIS HONOUR: I order that the drugs seized from the prisoner if not already done so should be destroyed.

      JUDGMENT  
      (on further application by Accused for adjournment of the trial)  
       
       
      
    1 JOHNSON J: This is an application by the Accused for a further adjournment of a trial fixed to commence on Monday, 19 March 2007.  
     
      
       
      The Application on 2 March 2007 
       
      
    2 On 2 March 2007, on the application of the Accused, I adjourned the trial from 5 March 2007 until next Monday, 19 March 2007. The circumstances underlying that application, and my reasons for granting the adjournment application, appear in my judgment, R v Petroulias (No 11). 
     
      
    3 Put shortly, the Accused based the application upon the fact that monies were required to fund his defence and that it was expected that those funds would become available at a point of time in the near future. As part of the application, it was contended for the Accused that he had sought to make appropriate arrangements with respect to the funding of his defence, but that due to what was said to be a mistaken transfer of monies, the sum involved had ended up in the trust account of a firm of solicitors in Brisbane, Home Wilkinson Lowry, and that there was controversy as to whether those monies would be repaid by that firm.  
     
      
    4 The adjournment application made then, and made again today, is not brought in accordance with the principles in Dietrich v The Queen (1992) 177 CLR 292 at 315. The Accused is not asserting that he is indigent and that, through no fault of his own, he is unable to obtain or maintain legal representation for his trial. Rather, as I observed in paragraph 5 of R v Petroulias (No. 11), the application is based upon the proposition that an adjournment of the trial ought be allowed to permit steps to be taken to ensure that monies are available to fund his defence. Section 40 Criminal Procedure Act 1986 provides the broad statutory foundation for the discretionary power of the Court to adjourn a criminal trial. 
     
      
    5 The application on 2 March 2007 was allowed so that the Accused could facilitate an urgent application to be made to the Supreme Court of Queensland with respect to a sum of $785,000.00 said to have been paid by mistake into the account of Home Wilkinson Lowry.  
     
      
       
      Events Between July 2006 and March 2007 
       
      
    6 Before moving to events since 2 March 2007, it is appropriate to look back at some matters of chronology with respect to these proceedings.  
     
      
    7 In July 2006, I commenced the hearing of a pre-trial application in which the Accused was represented by Mr Clelland SC and Mr Livermore of counsel. On 8 August 2006, I gave judgment with respect to that application: R v Petroulias (No. 1) [2006] NSWSC 788. 
     
      
    8 On 15 August 2006 (PT426.15), Mr Livermore mentioned that there was doubt as to whether he and Mr Clelland SC would continue to appear for the Accused in the second group of pre-trial applications which were to proceed to hearing. Mr Livermore observed that the Accused would be likely to be in a position of trying to secure resources to fund preparations for the hearing of further pre-trial applications. 
     
      
    9 In circumstances revealed in my judgments R v Petroulias (No 3) of 6 October 2006, and R v Petroulias (No. 4) of 19 October 2006, the second group of pre-trial applications were adjourned on the application of the Accused. It was apparent, by that stage, that counsel previously briefed in the matter would not continue to appear for the Accused at the trial level and that other counsel were to be briefed. 
     
      
    10 On 21 and 28 November 2006, a trial date of 5 March 2007 was identified and flagged (PT560, 572). 
     
      
    11 On 28 November 2006, it is said that the sum of $785,000.00 was paid by mistake by a company, Prepaid Professional Administration Limited (“Prepaid”), to Home Wilkinson Lowry.  
     
      
    12 Between 6 November 2006 and 15 February 2007, I proceeded to hear a number of pre-trial applications and gave judgments with respect to those applications: R v Petroulias (No. 5) [2006] NSWSC 1155; R v Petroulias (No. 6) [2006] NSWSC 1422; R v Petroulias (No. 7) [2007] NSWSC 16; R v Petroulias (No. 8) [2007] NSWSC 82 and R v Petroulias (No. 9) [2007] NSWSC 84. 
     
      
    13 The evidence before me on 2 March 2007, in the form of an affidavit of Mr Coady sworn 1 March 2007, revealed that, on 31 January 2007 and 2 February 2007, the Accused informed Mr Coady that a Mr Evans, a partner of Home Wilkinson Lowry, had refused to meet with the Accused to discuss the position with respect to the sum of $785,000.00. 
     
      
    14 On 8 February 2007, Mr Sutherland SC for the Accused, informed the Court (PT895-896), that, although at that time there did not appear to be an impediment to the trial starting on 5 March 2007, there was a matter, as he put it, “lingering in the background” (PT895.57). Mr Sutherland SC said that the Accused’s then business activities had ceased because of investigatory action taken by a number of agencies, and that, with respect to the private funding of the trial, there was a “matter of concern with my solicitors which has not at this stage resulted in any communication to Mr Walsh or myself which would compromise our ability to proceed” (PT896.18). Mr Sutherland SC hoped that there would not be any change in that respect (PT896.20). He indicated that this was a concern which the defence legal representatives were “working to resolve” (PT896.23).  
     
      
    15 The evidence reveals that, on 27 February 2007, Prepaid filed a Statement of Claim in the Supreme Court of Queensland, nominating Home Wilkinson Lowry as the Defendant, seeking recovery of monies.  
     
      
    16 At 4.50 pm on 28 February 2007, an email from Mr Sutherland SC was received in my chambers, indicating that, at the scheduled mention the following day, a number of applications would be brought, one of which would be an application to adjourn the trial. That application was made on 1 and 2 March 2007, culminating in my judgment, R v Petroulias (No. 11). 
     
      
    17 As it happened, on 2 March 2007 the High Court of Australia refused the Accused special leave to appeal from the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Petroulias v R [2006] NSWCCA 415 (a decision of 24 November 2006), which was, in turn, an application for leave to appeal from my decision in R v Petroulias (No 1) [2006] NSWSC 788 (a decision of 8 August 2006). 
     
      
       
      Judgment on 2 March 2007 
       
      
    18 I return to my judgment of 2 March 2007, R v Petroulias (No. 11). I indicated at [25] that the Crown opposed the application, and had submitted that the prospect of recovery of funds was so uncertain that no adjournment should be allowed; that there appeared to be significant factual disputes and that it was optimistic in the extreme to expect that there would be a speedy and favourable resolution of the Queensland proceedings.  
     
      
    19 The Crown submitted that there appeared to be a potential further claim on the funds from the Provisional Liquidator of a company, Prescience Communications Limited (“Prescience”). I said at [28]: 
     
      
       
        
        “An application for adjournment made, on this type of ground and at this stage proximate to the trial, must be considered carefully. The Accused says that he wishes to be represented by counsel and solicitors who have appeared for him now, in the case of the counsel for some months and in the case of the solicitors, for some years. The prospect of a trial with the Accused unrepresented, although a hypothetical prospect at this stage, is still a prospect which I can consider, and such a process has well-known disadvantages to the criminal justice system.” 
        
       
      
    20 I determined, on balance, that an adjournment ought be allowed for two weeks. I said at [30] that the granting of such an adjournment would allow “Mr Coady’s hopes to be measured against actual events” with respect to the Queensland litigation. I observed at [31] that I would list the matter for a directions hearing one week thereafter, to assess progress. I said: 
     
      
       
        
        “If, in one week’s time, it seems to me that there is an uncertain and complicated future likely with respect to this issue, so that the resolution of the claim on these funds will take some considerable time, then I am not likely to be persuaded that any further adjournment of the trial should take place. I will, of course, hear any submissions or application made, but there will need to be evidence of action taken and not mere expressions of hope and expectation.”  
        
       
      
     
     
      
      I said at [33]: 
      
     
     
      
       
        
        “If it is the position that the issue is unresolved, then the Crown’s submission that this trial should proceed, whether the Accused is represented or not, will attract considerable weight given the history of this matter. I will, of course, hear any further submissions or any application that may be made, but the trial will not be delayed indefinitely.” 
        
       
      
    21 I note that the affidavit of Mr Coady sworn 1 March 2007 revealed that the fee disclosure for the purpose of this trial calculated that a sum of $300,000.00 per month would be required with a four-month estimate for the trial. 
     
      
    22 In accordance with my direction of 2 March 2007, the matter was mentioned before me again on 9 March 2007. In the course of a judgment given that day for the purpose of an application to vary bail, R v Petroulias (No 12), I summarised (at [3]-[8]) what the evidence revealed to be the current position with respect to the Queensland litigation. Put shortly, an application for summary judgment was to be made in the Supreme Court of Queensland on 14 March 2007. Affidavits had been sworn and filed by Prepaid in support of that application. No response had been received from the Defendant, Home Wilkinson Lowry, at that time, and the Provisional Liquidator of Prescience had not disclosed any concluded position with respect to such an application, or any claim on the sum of money which was the subject of the Prepaid litigation. 
     
      
       
      Events Since 2 March 2007 
       
      
    23 I stood over the matter until 2.00 pm yesterday, 15 March 2007. When the matter was called on yesterday, Mr Sutherland SC provided me with a number of documents and indicated that various events had occurred in Brisbane on the previous day. A further adjournment of the trial for two weeks was sought. Submissions advanced to a point where I formed the view that it was appropriate that evidence be before the Court with respect to the application. I stood the matter over until this morning, and a further affidavit of Mr Coady sworn today has been filed together with an affidavit of Anthony James Scott, also sworn today. 
     
      
    24 The following appears to be the present position with respect to progress of the Prepaid litigation in Queensland. 
     
      
    25 The Defendant, Home Wilkinson Lowry, filed affidavits on 13 March 2007, accompanied by documents exceeding some four thousand pages in length. Senior counsel for Prepaid formed the view, in the light of that material, that the summary judgment application was not likely to succeed, nor was it likely to be heard, in any event, on 14 March 2007. Consent orders were made by Phillipides J that day dismissing Prepaid’s application for summary judgment, referring the proceedings to a Commercial Causes Judge with a view to expediting the final hearing and determination of the proceeding, and ordering pursuing to s.12 Trust Accounts Act 1973 (Qld) that the Defendant pay into Court the sum of $524,884.00. I am informed that that sum has not as yet been paid into Court. I am informed that application will be made today to Muir J for the purpose of fixing a directions hearing, with the view to seeking expedition and a hearing date to determine the Queensland proceedings. 
     
      
    26 The evidence before the Court today appears to reveal the following. The Defendant, Home Wilkinson Lowry, is pressing a claim for about $238,000.00, being the difference between the sum of $512,884.00 and $790,820.00. With respect to the sum of $512,884.00, which in accordance with the order of the Court ought be paid into Court, Home Wilkinson Lowry will not assert any claim on that fund. The Provisional Liquidator of Prescience, however, has indicated, on the evidence before me, that should an appointment be made before a Commercial Causes Judge in the Supreme Court of Queensland in accordance with the referral order of Phillipides J, the Provisional Liquidator will seek instructions. The solicitor for the Provisional Liquidator declined to say more than that his client maintained a right to the funds. 
     
      
    27 There is then, at this stage, a question mark over the prospects of Prepaid successfully recovering the sum of $512,884.00. The evidence indicates that Mr Scott, the solicitor for Pleroma Limited (“Pleroma”), has instructions to negotiate with the Provisional Liquidator of Prescience, with the view to the establishment of a suitable scheme of arrangement for attending to creditors of that company. It is said that, if this adjournment is allowed, negotiations will take place involving Mr Scott for Pleroma, the solicitor representing the Provisional Liquidator of Prescience, and Mr Coady representing the interests of the Accused.  
     
      
    28 Mr Coady said in his memorandum of 15 March 2007 (which forms part of Exhibit B), that it would be necessary for him to spend approximately two days in discussions and document drafting with the Provisional Liquidator, and a similar time for discussions, including correspondence, with Mr Scott, in order that he could “obtain preliminary binding agreements relating ultimately to the ability to apply the Queensland funds (those paid into court) to the defence of Mr Petroulias”. Mr Coady said that he would need “time to arrange court appointments and hearings to obtain court approval to the proposed scheme of arrangement and for striking out of the winding-up application” with respect to Prescience. He said, “a time of two weeks may be sufficient for those parts of the above procedure to be undertaken to the point where I have confidence that the alternative proposal will be satisfactory”.  
     
      
    29 It was the evidence of Mr Coady this morning that a sum of $270,000.00 presently sits in his trust account with respect to fees incurred for the defence of the Accused since 1 March 2007. 
     
      
       
      The Present Application 
       
      
    30 Mr Sutherland SC submits that a period of two weeks will hopefully allow resolution of outstanding issues in Queensland, and if that occurs, the sum of $500,000.00 or thereabouts can be added to the amount presently held in trust so that the solicitors for the Accused will be in a position to maintain the current brief to counsel to appear on this trial. It is said that, unless those arrangements are put into place, then instructions of counsel would be withdrawn.  
     
      
    31 In paragraph 10 of Mr Coady’s affidavit sworn today, he refers to instructions from the Accused that, should be lose the benefit of counsel and solicitors, his arrangements for litigation funding will probably fail and he must make arrangements to apply for legal aid. It is said that he would then need to marshal his own records so that other legal representatives could become available for the purpose of any trial. It is said that, in the event that the Accused was to represent himself, a time measured in months would be required to allow him to prepare to represent himself. 
     
      
    32 I raised directly with Mr Sutherland SC this morning what would happen in two weeks. In response to my question whether the trial would definitely proceed in two weeks, Mr Sutherland SC responded that those were his instructions based upon Mr Coady’s hopes, but that that involved an element of “crystal ball gazing”.  
     
      
    33 This trial has been scheduled for months. The pre trial applications have been on foot for months. The Accused knew, in August last year, that a further set of legal representatives would be required for this trial, his Victorian counsel apparently no being longer likely to appear, apart from in the Court of Criminal Appeal and the High Court of Australia. 
     
      
    34 In my judgment of 2 March 2007, I expressed concern that, if an uncertain and complicated future appeared likely with respect to this issue so that the resolution of the claim on these funds would take some considerable time, then I would not likely be persuaded that any further adjournment of the trial should take place. I noted also that the Crown’s submission that the Accused should be in a position to represent himself may attract considerable weight given the history of the matter. 
     
      
    35 It seems to me that there is still uncertainty, and considerable uncertainty, as to what is to occur with respect to the Queensland litigation. In reality, Mr Coady wishes to embark upon a process of negotiation with the Provisional Liquidator and Mr Scott, in the hope that a process may be reached which will see the sum of about $500,000.00 becoming available.  
     
      
    36 It seems unlikely, indeed most unlikely, that there will be any hearing of the Prepaid matter in the Supreme Court of Queensland in the next two weeks. There has not as yet been a directions hearing before the Commercial Causes Judge.  
     
      
    37 There is a public interest in a trial of a serious criminal matter proceeding without delay. The interests of the Accused must be taken into account. My duties as trial judge include the duty to, so far as possible, take steps to see that the Accused has a fair trial. There is no application presently made based upon the Dietrich principle. 
     
      
    38 The Crown has submitted that the trial has been put off once, and it is now sought to put it off once again on an uncertain and somewhat vague basis. It is submitted that the prospect is that, in two weeks’ time, there will be yet another application for another adjournment because more time is needed to deal with some aspect involved in the unravelling of the Queensland litigation. It is submitted that the likely scenario is that a further adjournment, and perhaps a series of adjournments extending over some time, will be sought. 
     
      
    39 I have given careful consideration to the matters raised on the application, including the interests of the Accused, the interests of the community and the interest of the Court in having the assistance of counsel familiar with the case appearing at trial. The concern that I have is that this application is the second chapter, of what is likely to be a volume made up of a number of chapters.  
     
      
    40 It is the case that a sum of $270,000.00 is now held in trust for the defence of the Accused. It is hoped that further funds will become available as a result of negotiations to be undertaken in Queensland.  
     
      
    41 I am not presently satisfied, on balance, given the uncertain state of the evidence, that an adjournment of two weeks will achieve the result hoped for by the Accused. I understand well my obligation to seek to ensure that the Accused has a fair trial. Insofar as that is a factor which I take into account with others in the exercise of discretion with respect to this adjournment application, I have reached the conclusion that the appropriate course is to refuse the present application.  
     
      
    42 I am not satisfied that an adjournment of the trial will see the result that the trial will be ready to proceed in the near future. The purpose of the application is to obtain time to ensure that funds are available. I am not satisfied that this purpose will be achieved in the near future, or indeed in the foreseeable future.  
     
      
    43 The application for adjournment is refused.  
     
      
      SUTHERLAND: I’ll need to withdraw and take some instructions, your Honour. 
      
     
     
      
      HIS HONOUR: All right, I’ll adjourn to give you an opportunity to take some instructions. I have a Possession List call-up of 26 matters commencing at 2 o’clock which will occupy me for the entire afternoon beyond 4 o’clock, so there will be no time available to devote to this matter beyond 2. If there is any application to be made, it must be made and determined before 1 o’clock. How long do you want at this stage? 
      
     
     
      
      SUTHERLAND: I don’t know, your Honour. I truly don’t know. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: I’ll give you ten minutes to start with and then you might tell me what will happen from there. 
       
       
      SHORT ADJOURNMENT 
       
       
      SUTHERLAND: Your Honour, I’ve come back to court as a courtesy to your Honour, simply to indicate that in light of your Honour’s direction I’m told by Mr Coady that my instructions will be withdrawn and I think he will appear before your Honour at the moment. Mr Coady will seek to appear before your Honour at the moment. Would your Honour excuse me. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Yes, Mr Sutherland. Yes, Mr Coady. 
       
       
      COADY: Your Honour, I don’t think it’s incorrect for me to say that in discussions with Mr Sutherland, and he having spoken with Mr Walsh, believes that they are ethically required not to commence a trial where there instructions won’t be withdrawn halfway through the trial. That creates the dilemma that we must make the decision to withdraw instructions at this point in time. I appear on behalf of Mr Petroulias at this stage and just simply make an application for an adjournment of this matter for one week to enable us to consider his position and to endeavour to create some semblance of order out of what we would say on our side of the bar table is now chaos. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Well are you applying on the basis that he’s going to make an application for legal aid? 
       
       
      COADY: I’m making an application now for an adjournment for a week. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: So that he can apply for legal aid? 
       
       
      COADY: That will be one of the matters that will be undertaken, your Honour. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: So there is going to be an application for legal aid, is that so? 
       
       
      COADY: No, I’m not saying that, your Honour. My enquiries have revealed that there is little chance that he would get legal aid and I don’t want to be caught up in unnecessary applications. However, enquiries will be made as to those matters and if there is any potential, yes, that would be done. I don’t believe that anything further need be said because all of the material relating to the difficulty of changeover and of the matters as to certainty or otherwise of the Queensland matters have already been canvassed before your Honour. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: So what are the steps that will be taken if a one-week adjournment is granted? 
       
       
      COADY: I’ll go away and sit with counsel and seek their assistance, and I’ll discuss the matters with Mr Petroulias. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Mr Petroulias will prepare himself for a trial? 
       
       
      COADY: Yes, that will be certainly one of the alternatives he will consider. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Will he do that? 
       
       
      COADY: He’s already said through me on affidavit that it would take some time for him to prepare for trial. He will do what he can as one of the matters that we wish to consider over the next week. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Has he taken any steps in the last two weeks to prepare for a trial at which he may appear for himself? 
       
       
      COADY: No, your Honour. There has been an expectation on his part that he would be able to continue with his legal advisers. The task of preparing for trial is a task which would be far greater than the period of time that’s been available in the last two weeks. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Insofar as there is an indication that there may be little chance that he will get legal aid-- 
       
       
      COADY: That’s my belief. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: --you are telling me that it is his desire nevertheless to explore that possibility and have a decision? 
       
       
      COADY: That’s one, but more predominantly is his concern and my concern on his part to find the capacity to re engage counsel and to maintain his existing solicitors. It’s our view that this would expedite the matter far better from the public interest, far better from the point of view of long trials, and would avoid any inconvenience or uncertainty for the court and for Mr Petroulias at a later time. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Mr Crown, what’s the crown response? 
       
       
      CROWN PROSECUTOR: Your Honour, I’m a little uncertain as to the basis upon which the adjournment is being made. If it is on the basis, as I understood Mr Coady indirectly averting to towards the end of what he just said of pursuing the arrangements which have already been canvassed for the purposes of securing funds to enable counsel to appear, then I would object, oppose the adjournment for the reasons that your Honour has already given in your judgment. If however the week is being sought to enable alternative representation to be made by Mr Coady or by the Accused himself, then my objection is less firm.  
       
       
      However, can I just add to the equation the fact that in reality what will happen I expect is following the empanelment of the jury, I will open for two days I expect, which is what I spent last time opening. I understood what Mr Coady said at the beginning of his application was that he had in mind as I thought he said restoring some order to the defence position, which I assume to be a reference to getting documents together to enable preparation to be made for the defence of the Accused at the trial. Some of that of course could be done in the course of the opening, or alternatively your Honour might I suppose entertain the application for a week on the basis that that week will be spent putting in place alternative arrangements for Mr Petroulias’ defence, either by Mr Coady or the Accused himself, marshalling the documents and the other material necessary to conduct the defence. If the application is simply back on the old secure funding basis, then I would oppose it. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: One way forward which is possible is to adjourn the matter for a week, to bring the matter back before me at 10.00 am next Wednesday, so that I am told if there has been an application for legal aid made and, if so, whether it has been determined. It may be that if that occurs and if there is an application for legal aid, that in accordance with the practice that often occurs where this situation occurs in this court, an officer of the Legal Aid Commission may attend court to tell the court what’s happening. That is if the legal aid application is taken up. Otherwise, if there is no application for legal aid made and if none is to be made, then the purpose of mentioning the matter on Wednesday would be so that the court is so informed and to note that the matter will proceed the following week, namely on the 26th. 
       
       
      Insofar as it is said that the Accused has not taken steps to prepare for the trial in the last two weeks, whatever his perception may have been, despite what was said in the judgment, then he will be in a position to undertake some steps in the next week. A week at this stage it seems to me to be fair, but it is not just a week, it would seem to me on an open-ended basis that it’s a week for the Accused to more or less consider his position. It is a week in which, if there is to be an application for legal aid, it will be made, not just made but pursued expeditiously and with an expectation on Wednesday the 21st that the court would be informed of what’s happening in that respect, and otherwise confirmation that the Accused, if he is to be unrepresented, taking steps to prepare for trial. 
       
       
      I acknowledge what you say, that there is some generality about the basis of the application, but I have sought to give some particularity as to what I would see as being the steps to be undertaken, and it seems to me in circumstances where the ruling was made this morning, if there is to be an application for legal aid made, the Accused should have an opportunity to make it promptly and expeditiously, and although Mr Coady may have a pessimistic view as to the outcome, if the Accused wishes to make it, it will be a matter for him. 
       
       
      Mr Coady, in the light of what I have said, do you want to say anything further? 
       
       
      COADY: The only thing your Honour is if it’s going to be a week, could I ask you to make the mention on Friday? 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: No. The problem with that is it may as well be the Monday. I will make it Tuesday. I will make it no later than Thursday. What I want to do is to not have a situation where what happens on the next occasion is another adjournment application. I don’t want the next appearance to be the sitting day immediately preceding the commencement of what would be the commencement of the trial. 
       
       
      COADY: Part of the difficulty with bridging the time between mentions is that that means that those of us who are assisting on other matters may have to truncate other activities to be able to be prepared and ready for the application on that-- 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Mr Coady, I’m sorry. The Accused is to face trial in the Supreme Court of New South Wales for serious criminal charges. 
       
       
      COADY: Your Honour, I don’t challenge-- 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: I don’t think I need to say that. And the Supreme Court has been waiting for some time. Arrangements were made. More than 200 citizens in this State have been affected. Certainty is needed. Now if you want to make a submission it should be Tuesday or Wednesday or Thursday. It will be no later than 9.30 on Thursday if it’s Thursday. 
       
       
      COADY: My application is for Thursday, your Honour. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Do you have anything to say about that, Mr Crown? 
       
       
      CROWN PROSECUTOR: No, your Honour. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: I don’t propose to deliver a separate and detailed judgment unless the parties wish me to do. It will be sufficiently clear - perhaps I should ask, is a further judgment required by the parties or is it sufficient that what I have said and the reasons for my approach will be clear in the transcript? 
       
       
      COADY: Yes, your Honour. 
       
       
      CROWN PROSECUTOR: Yes, your Honour. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: I propose to grant a one week adjournment to the Accused with respect to the trial and, as indicated in exchanges with counsel and Mr Coady, the purpose of the adjournment is to allow the Accused, who is now faced with my ruling this morning, with an opportunity, if he so wishes to make an application for legal aid, expeditiously and without delay, and to otherwise undertake preparation for the trial. I observe in any event that the Accused, if this trial had not been adjourned, would have been here every day at court devoted totally to this trial for the last two weeks. It is my expectation that he should be devoting himself entirely to the preparation for this trial. I am somewhat surprised that he is not to some extent ready having regard to what was said previously. So there will be an adjournment for one week.  
       
       
      I will therefore direct that the trial date be vacated from 19 March 2007 and I fix the trial to commence on 26 March 2007. I direct that the matter be listed before me at 9.30 am on Thursday 22 March 2007. If the Accused proposes to make an application for legal aid, I would expect that the application will be made promptly, and if it has not been determined by 22 March 2007 I would expect some explanation as to the state of the application. The court would be greatly assisted, if an application is made, by the attendance of a solicitor from the indictable section of the Legal Aid Commission to explain the status of that application, if an application is made and it is not resolved by then. 
       
       
      THE ACCUSED’S BAIL IS CONTINUED UNTIL 9.30 AM ON 22 MARCH 2007.  
       
      Is there any other matter? 
       
       
      CROWN PROSECUTOR: No, your Honour. 
       
       
      STOOD OVER TO THURSDAY 22 MARCH 2007 AT 9.30 AM

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: The applicant pleaded guilty in the District Court to one count alleging that on 20 February 2004 he maliciously wounded Sharna Michelle Lazer contrary to s 35(1)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). The offence attracted a maximum penalty of 7 years imprisonment. The applicant was sentenced to an overall term of 2 years 3 months, commencing 12 September 2005 and expiring on 11 December 2007, with a non-parole period of 20 months, commencing 12 September 2005 and expiring on 11 May 2007. The sentencing judge allowed a 25% discount for an early plea of guilty but did not find special circumstances. 
     
      
    2 The applicant seeks leave to appeal against his sentence. He relies upon the following grounds: 
     
      
       
      1. The sentencing judge erred in failing to find “special circumstances” 
       
       
      2. The sentence is manifestly excessive in all of the circumstances of the case. 
       
       
      3. A different, less severe, sentence is warranted and ought to have been imposed. 
       
       
      The facts 
       
      
    3 The applicant and his victim had been living in a de facto relationship which had borne a daughter named, Jahnali. The child was aged 6 months. By the time of the offence the relationship between the applicant and Ms Lazer had come to an end although they continued to have contact in relation to the child. 
     
      
    4 At about 4.30 pm on 20 February 2004 Ms Lazer was walking home from Tweed Heads South with her children, Jahnali and Jyrih and accompanied by a friend Ms Tahlia Rotumah. The applicant got out of a motor vehicle and came towards the group. The applicant grabbed Jahnali out of the pram. Ms Lazer told the applicant to leave the child alone and that she was taking her home. The applicant said: “I am taking her to the pub.” Ms Lazer protested “she has got no nappies. You’re an idiot.” The applicant tried to grab the pram but Ms Lazer was able to push it away. The applicant walked with Jahnali into the hotel. 
     
      
    5 At the time of this incident the applicant was intoxicated. He was carrying a bottle of rum which he had partially consumed. Ms Lazer walked to a friend’s house where she left Ms Rotumah and Jyrih and then returned to the hotel to retrieve Jahnali. She walked inside the hotel and confronted the applicant. She said “give me back baby” The applicant said: “Fuck off you’re not having her” Ms Lazer said: “Fine, go crawl under a rock.” 
     
      
    6 Ms Lazer returned to her friend’s house where a number of people were present including Annika Rotumah. Whilst she was at the front of the house the applicant turned up with Jahnali and walked toward her. The applicant gave Jahnali to Annika and said: “What the fuck is going on?” The applicant then swung the bottle of rum he was holding and hit Ms Lazer on the head. The bottle then hit the window of a nearby car and fell on the ground. Ms Lazer grabbed the bottle and as she ran off threw it away to ensure the applicant would not hit her with it again. As she ran she heard witnesses call out: “Look out Sharna.”  
     
      
    7 The applicant then hit Ms Lazer in the face with a long necked bottle of beer. She fell to the ground bleeding from her face. As she lay on the ground the applicant kicked her in the side of the face several times. Ms Lazer held her face and covered her head to protect herself. She is unsure what exactly happened after that. An ambulance arrived and she was taken to hospital. 
     
      
    8 Ms Lazer suffered injuries, which included a 3.5 cm long and 1 cm deep laceration to the nose, a further laceration to the nose l.2 cm long and .3 cm deep, a laceration over the left frontal region of the scalp 2.5 cm long and bruising over the left cheek and left shoulder. A small amount of glass was removed from the laceration to the scalp. All the lacerations were sutured. 
     
      
    9 It was necessary for Ms Lazer to attend hospital again on 13 April 2004 when she complained of pain and swelling to her nose. Her nose had become infected and was deviating to the left. It was discovered that her nose had been fractured at the time of the original injuries. The infection was treated with antibiotics and she was given a referral for corrective surgery to rectify the deviation to her nose. 
     
      
       
      The applicant’s subjective case and other mitigating features 
       
      
    10 The applicant was aged 34 at the time of the offence and 36 at the time of sentence. He had a prior criminal record, predominantly for committing crimes of violence and dishonesty. He had previously assaulted the victim and had breached apprehended violence orders which she had obtained. Prior to being incarcerated in relation to this offence he had never served a term of full-time imprisonment. On 14 April 2003 he was sentenced to a term of 9 months imprisonment in relation to a number of offences. However, that sentence was suspended upon the applicant entering into a bond under s 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW). The conditions of the bond were to undergo supervision by the New South Wales Probation and Parole Service and accept referral to drugs/alcohol authority for assessment and counselling and also programs including anger management at the discretion of the Probation and Parole Service. It would appear that the applicant did not satisfy those requirements. 
     
      
    11 The suspended sentence came to an end on 14 January 2004. The present offence was committed on 20 February 2004. The applicant was arrested on that day and granted bail. He absconded. He was re-arrested on 9 March 2004 and remained in custody until 19 April 2004 being a total of 41 days. He then absconded again and was not re-arrested until 16 October 2005. He has remained in custody since that date. 
     
      
    12 A report from Dr Nelson was tendered. He described the applicant as “an athletically built aboriginal man.” He was born in Broken Hill, the middle of 5 children. He lived with his parents until the age of 10, when his parents separated and he went to live with his grandmother in Ivanhoe, NSW until the age of 12. He witnessed his parents arguing a great deal and observed physical assaults on his mother by his father.  
     
      
    13 At age 13 he went to the Gold Coast and lived with a “white family” until he left home at 16. That period appeared to be reasonably stable, although the move left the applicant feeling abandoned, having been displaced without his family support system. Dr Nelson concluded that this “displacement and abandonment led to feelings of frustration as well as loss and hopelessness underlying his dysthymia.” 
     
      
    14 The applicant left home at age 16 and commenced working on the railways as a station assistant. He appears to have been steadily employed until his arrest. He did not start drinking at school because he had witnessed alcohol abuse in his family. By the age of 18 years he was drinking moderately, later becoming a heavy drinker. He was used to drinking 10 schooners at a sitting by the time he was 23. In recent years he reported to Dr Nelson that he was “working for drink.” On the day of the offence he had also consumed a narcotic drug. 
     
      
    15 Testing revealed that the applicant had a “significant substance abuse problem.” He has been analysed as having difficulties with his self-esteem. Dr Nelson formed the view that the applicant appeared to be “highly motivated to change the course of his life.” Dr Nelson believed that termination of his chemical abuse would be the most productive path for the applicant towards rehabilitation. It would appear that he has been able to successfully abstain from drug and alcohol consumption whilst in custody. Unless the applicant is able to continue down this path Dr Nelson believes that his future may be difficult. However, he reported that “it is my opinion that if his substance abuse is successfully treated, his risk of future violence would be low.” 
     
      
       
      The applicant’s submissions 
       
      
    16 Although three grounds of appeal have been raised, the applicant’s counsel accepted that there were difficulties in sustaining a submission that the sentence was excessive. Oral submissions were confined to a challenge to the sentencing judge’s decision not to find special circumstances. 
     
      
    17 The applicant submitted that the sentencing judge had erred by forming a restricted view as to what constituted “special circumstances.” This error was said to be reflected in the fact that the sentencing judge had limited himself to the material in the report of Dr Nelson. It was submitted that his Honour had failed to take into account all the available mitigating circumstances, including the applicant’s aboriginality and the matters identified by Wood CJ at CL in R v Fernando (1992) 76 A Crim R 58. It was also submitted that the sentencing judge had placed undue weight on the fact that although, in the past, treatment had been considered it had not taken place. It was further submitted that his Honour should have given greater weight to the fact that the applicant was now highly motivated to engage the drug and alcohol rehabilitation program. If his rehabilitation was to be effective it was submitted that there was a need for a substantial period of parole. Finally it was submitted that insufficient consideration was given to the fact that this was the first time the applicant was sentenced to full-time custody. It was submitted that a custodial sentence would make him “a foreigner in his own country” thereby imposing additional hardship on him. 
     
      
       
      Resolution of the application 
       
      
    18 As the facts which I have recorded demonstrate, this was a brutal crime which inflicted serious injury to the victim’s face with inevitable permanent scarring. Having regard to the serious nature of the crime, the overall term of the sentence was well within the appropriate range. 
     
      
    19 There is no doubt that a sentence of full-time custody was appropriate. The only issue of concern is the most effective approach to the applicant’s rehabilitation. 
     
      
    20 The applicant submitted that being an Aboriginal, the decision in Fernando obliges the Court to take a more lenient approach to the applicant’s sentence, including a generous exercise of the discretion to find special circumstances. 
     
      
    21 In my opinion this submission misunderstands Fernando, which was decided by Wood CJ at CL. As his Honour said in the later decision in Ceissman v R (2001) 119 A Crim R 535, Fernando “is not to be regarded as a decision justifying special leniency merely because of the aboriginality of the offender” [31]. Sentencing principles are non-discriminatory and are to be applied to all offenders irrespective of their particular racial or ethnic group: see Simpson J in Hickey (unreported, Court of Criminal Appeal, 27 September 1994). When one or more of the factors identified in Fernando are present they may indicate circumstances of particular disadvantage to an offender, and accordingly be relevant to the sentencing process. However, a sentence which is appropriate having regard to all of the circumstances of the case must still be imposed. 
     
      
    22 In Fernando Wood CJ at CL emphasised that the offender had come from a deprived background, living for a considerable time on an isolated mission property. This matter was not only relevant in understanding, with a number of other matters, how he came to commit the offence, it was also relevant to the severity for that offender of his incarceration in a conventional prison. This feature is not present in the background of the present offender. It is true that the history of alcohol abuse and the fact that the offence was committed when the offender was intoxicated was a feature of the offending in Fernando, as it was of the present case. However, regrettably, alcohol abuse is a factor in many violent crimes, whatever the racial background of the offender. 
     
      
    23 In the present case the sentencing judge was required to evaluate whether the objective of rehabilitation would be furthered if he provided for the applicant’s early release on parole. The concession involved in reducing his non-parole period could only be justified if it was likely to provide an opportunity, which the offender would utilise, to give up his excessive use of alcohol and narcotics. 
     
      
    24 In making that decision his Honour was entitled to consider the use which the offender had made of previous opportunities to address his drug and alcohol issues. In that respect his record was regrettably one of failure. He was sentenced on 14 April 2003 for a violent offence committed on the same victim. A 9 month suspended sentence was imposed on condition that he accept referral to counselling for drug and alcohol issues and anger management. He failed to comply with the condition. When the applicant was granted bail in respect of the present offences it was on condition that he enter a drug rehabilitation centre (Benelong Haven Kempsey) within 48 hours of release. He failed to do so. 
     
      
    25 Dr Nelson’s reported that in prison the applicant had been alcohol and drug free and offered the opinion that he had “been continually frustrated” in his efforts to enter rehabilitation programs. However, the applicant did not give evidence and, in my opinion, the sentencing judge could give little weight to Dr Nelson’s opinion: R v Qutami (2001) 127 A Crim R 369 at [58] and [79]. 
     
      
    26 In these circumstances in my view his Honour was entitled to conclude that a finding of special circumstances and a longer period of supervised parole was not appropriate. The evidence inevitably led to the conclusion that the applicant would not avail himself of the opportunity. Furthermore, when sentencing the offender his Honour was mindful of the contribution of drugs and alcohol to the commission of the offence, accepting that they operated to mitigate the sentence. It was important for his Honour to ensure that these matters were not “double counted” when determining the appropriate non-parole period: R v Simpson (2001) 53 NSWLR 704 [47]-[63]. 
     
      
    27 It was important in this case that after considering all of the relevant circumstances the offender’s criminality should be visited with an appropriate sentence, including an appropriate period of full-time custody. To my mind any lesser period without parole than the 20 months his Honour imposed may have led to an inappropriately low sentence. There can be no doubt that the applicant will require supervision on release. If a greater period than the 7 months which his Honour imposed was required, it may have been appropriate to increase the overall term of the sentence but not reduce the non-parole period. It must also be remembered that if, as the applicant asserts, he is now genuinely determined to deal with his drug and alcohol problems, the completion of his parole period will not preclude his continuing participation in appropriate treatment and counselling programs. 
     
      
    28 In my view there was no error in his Honour’s failure to find special circumstances. 
     
      
       
      Orders 
       
      
    29 Although I would grant leave to appeal, I would dismiss the appeal. 
     
      
    30 SULLY J: I agree with McClellan CJ at CL. 
     
      
    31 HOWIE J: I agree with the orders proposed by McClellan CJ at CL for the reasons given by him.

    SENTENCE1 HIS HONOUR: Ahmed Raad was granted parole on 28 January 2005. He returned home to live with his mother and sister. He became engaged to a young lady, Maria, with whom he had been close to for two years. She has no prior history of drugs. He was ten months into a three year parole period when five minutes walk from where he lives a robbery occurred. 2 Nicholas Borel born in Shambourg, France qualified in architecture and interior design, at the conclusion of his studies travelled from Lyon in France to Australia in 2005 to improve his English and gain international experience in interior design. He was twenty-five years old. He started his working career in Australia washing cars. He then met a fellow countryman living in Riverwood. Nicholas Borel moved there to share a flat in Michigan Road, that was the road that was five minutes walk from Ahmed Raad’s house.3 On 29 October 2005 on returning from the city looking for work, he was robbed at knifepoint by another man of about the same age. That robbery occurred at the entrance to the block of flats where he lived. A jury after a three day trial convicted the Ahmed Raad as being the man who robbed Nicholas Borel. Today he is to be held accountable for his criminal conduct. As the sentencing Judge it falls to me to resolve a number of competing tensions, as I strive to determine the appropriate sentence for this offence, before this Court, committed by this offender, harming this victim, in this community. Queen v Gladue [1999] SCR 688 at [80].4 My initial task requires an assessment of the objective criminality of this offence. I will also need to have regard to matters personal to the offender (his subjective features). The starting point for these assessments requires me to make findings of fact from the evidence before the Court relating to both the offence and to the offender. I shall also have to assess the rehabilitation prospects of the offender even though looking through a glass darkly. Before any sentence can be made there are likely to be technical questions relating to deterrence, whether special circumstances are to be found, the length of the parole period and finally, of course, the ultimate length of the term of imprisonment or other penalty that is to be imposed. None of that can be determined until the primary facts of this case are determined. 5 What weight needs to be given to all of these matters against the imperative that all sentencing should have as its focus the protection of the community needs to be determined. See Queen v Cuthbert 1967 86 Weekly Notes, part 1, 272, 2NSWR329; Queen v Rushby (1977) NSWLR 597 and Queen v Hayes 1984 1 NSWLR 740.Facts: 6 Nicholas Borel made his way from the railway station to Michigan Road. He noticed Raad walking slowly in front of him. He passed Raad and walked down the footpath towards his block of flats. He passed through the gates to the flats, then felt Raad grab his right arm. Borel turned, there was a knife held close to his abdomen. Raad was holding this knife. Raad said “Your telephone”. Borel gave over his phone. Raad said “Your money”. Borel took a $50 bill from a pocket in his clutch bag. Raad said “No I want more”. There was another $250 that fell to the ground. Raad grabbed the money. Raad’s fourth demand was “Your watch”. Borel surrendered his Fiesta brand watch. Raad ran toward the interior of the block of flats. I am satisfied he was taking a short cut to his premises. Borel estimates the robbery took approximately two minutes. 7 There can be no doubt the robbery terrified Nicholas Borel. He ran to his flat, locked himself inside and waited several hours for his flatmate to return. Some two or three days later, forced to use the public phone because of the loss of his mobile, he was ringing his mother. He saw Raad; believed Raad recognised him. Borel cut short the telephone call and went directly to his flat, again locked himself inside, did not put on any light and waited in the growing darkness for his flatmate to return. The following day Borel moved from the area.Objective Criminality: 8 From the facts as he finds them to be the sentencing Judge is required to assess the objective criminality of the offence as an essential step in assessing the seriousness of the criminal behaviour of the offender. That is done by comparing objectively the criminality exhibited in the instant offence with criminality of offences of a similar kind. It is in this way that the seriousness of this offence can be evaluated. The objective criminality will have an important impact on the overall sentencing outcome. 9 Justice Gleeson when Chief Justice of New South Wales encapsulated the essence of the legal wrong, or the criminal wrong if you like, done by robbers and the reason why substantial punishment is required. See Queen v Rause unreported NSWCCA 8 August 1992.His Honour said:  One of the primary purposes of the system of criminal justice is to keep the peace. In this connection the idea of peace embraces the freedom of ordinary citizens to walk the streets and to go about their daily business without fear of violence. It also embraces respect for the property of others. So offences of the kind committed by the present [offender] are not trivial instances of disrespect to private property. They amount to serious breaches of the peace. They are direct attacks upon the security of the person and the property which the law exists to protect.10 The criminal essence of armed robbery is the use of a weapon, in this case a knife, to overcome the willpower of the person to whom the knife is presented, so that he, against his will, surrenders property of some personal value to him.11 This offender presents as a strongly built young man. Borel obviously felt he was no match for the offender, armed as he was with a knife. The knife was described as a blue handled fishing knife. The presentation of the weapon constitutes one of the elements of the offence and for that reason does not amount to a circumstance of aggravation. The victim had four demands made upon him, his watch and his phone were personal items. The taking of the phone deprived him of the means of seeking emergency help for himself at a time of trauma and clearly increased the offender’s chances of getting away without detection. 12 It is reasonable to infer, contained within the phone, was a phone index of contacts and their phone numbers. The watch, as with other jewellery, may well have had sentimental significance for Borel.13 The evidence has made apparent the significant traumatic effect Raad’s criminal conduct had upon his victim. The violence of the conduct was real and felt by Borel. It was a violence accomplished by the powerful force of menace. Menace from the exposed weapon near his abdomen and in my view the offender’s powerful physical presence. I say “in my view” because the victim himself described him as being much the same build, but that was certainly not so. There was also the element of surprise and brazenness. 14 The violence of course is an element of the offence, it does not amount to aggravation. I cannot be satisfied that there was any planning. It would appear this was an opportunistic offence. The principal feature of aggravation is that the offence occurred whilst Raad was on parole. I deal with this aspect in more detail later. For reasons I give later I am satisfied this was a drug related offence.15 I have had regard to matters of aggravation enumerated in s 21(A) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. In this case though, I have sought to deal with all matters of aggravation by reliance upon the Common Law principles and the relevant factors of aggravation in assessing the object criminality. This is not a case where I would regard factors of aggravation being so prominent as to require them to be dealt with anew by reliance upon s 21(A).Subjective Factors: 16 I turn now to the subjective factors. I am both entitled and required to do that. Not only am I sentencing for the criminal offence I have just described, but also I am sentencing this offender for it. Each offender coming before the Court varies from other offenders who stand or who have stood for sentence. Circumstances personal to the offender may offer to the Court some explanation and insight into the commission of this offence by him, or some reason why a more, or less, sentencing outcome is appropriate.Family Dynamics, Background and Relationships: 17 Ahmed Raad was born in Sydney in December 1982. He is twenty-four years old and a single man. His parents had earlier migrated to Australia from Lebanon. He is the youngest of four siblings. He has lived with his family in Riverwood Housing Commission accommodation for twenty years. His father, a barber, owns his own business. There are plans for the offender to take over the business, although it would seem he needs to complete his qualifications before that can happen.18 His mother focussed on home duties and raising the children. She may well be depressed. The offender’s sister gave evidence in the trial. While the jury verdict strongly suggests it rejected the main thrust of her evidence, she gave evidence that she was her mother’s main carer. For what reason the mother needs a carer is unclear. Ahmed Raad claims his father and elder brother were disciplinarians towards him. He describes his father as having a tendency towards extreme anger on occasions. He claims his elder brother, Zac, physically assaulted him daily for awhile. These assaults were said to be condoned by the father. Ahmed Raad ran away from home aged sixteen and a half, only to be found by both the father and brother, and beaten by the father. His sister and mother protested this treatment.19 In his early days he idolised his father. He would go each weekend to football games. Aged eleven though, things changed. With hindsight it seems the father was having an extramarital affair. The father’s priorities within the family became altered. The offender’s response was to look for comfort and acceptance among a negative peer group. In more recent years the father has reconciled with the family and it would seem, contact between father and son has increased perhaps even to a working relationship.Education, Skills, Vocational Training:20 During primary school the offender apparently performed reasonably well. He was accepted by students and staff. In his final year at primary school he was appointed school captain; that is a leadership roll. However by Year Eight and Nine of high school there was a significant deterioration. His peer group had changed as mentioned above. He had truanted frequently. At very least he was supporting others of his group bullying and standing over children and taking their money, probably their lunch money. 21 He was experimenting with illegal drugs. He left school at school certificate year which he claims to have completed. He commenced a hair dressing course at TAFE. He has completed all but six months of the theoretically component of his hair dressing apprenticeship but there are still substantial practical requirements, I think a year of work experience, to be completed. He has had some experience working in his father’s shop. There is apparently a hope and plan that he will take over the father’s business. 22 In evidence before me he claims to have worked there in 2005 whilst on parole. However he told Mitchell Player, a forensic psychologist he would see his father once every few weeks whilst on release. Those two statements do not work well together for me. After release he worked for four months doing formwork. That requires intensive physical labouring. He sustained injury to his back and shoulders. He has an interest in physical fitness and in body building. He presses weights. He takes pride in, and it would appear he is competent at body building. The injury slowed up his capacity to participate in that sport.Health: 23 Ahmed Raad presents as physically powerful, consistent with his interest in the sport of body building. He reports he is over his back injury. So far as one can tell he would appear to otherwise enjoy good physical health.Mental Health Issues: 24 Prior to this present incarceration his GP diagnosed him with depression and prescribed Auroix. He claims that depression has lifted. Currently he is not taking medication. However, he reports a significant change of mood whilst incarcerated. There are increases in feelings of anger, a sometime symptom of depression. Occasionally he has experienced an impulse to explode but today has been able to resist it. He recognises gaol as a stress for him. Custody records would indicate his custodians are aware of depression and anxiety issues. I suspect that he still has his depression. Drug Abuse Issues: 25 The author of the pre-sentence report notes that historically the offender has struggled with illicit drug dependencies primarily heroin and cannabis. The offender denies drug involvement whilst on parole. Accepting that his fiancé is free of drugs and probably opposed to drugs, the offender would have a powerful motive for lying. 26 He was admitted to custody on 8 December 2005. Within a month he supplied a dirty urine. The Probation and Parole author regarded him as struggling with drug dependencies. Any supervision of him by Probation and Parole would require of him, among other things, treatment for drug dependency and random urine analysis to confirm abstinence.27 The commission of the offence, whilst denied, means that motive is unclear. However the taking of money and items to be pawned/sold is consistent with drug related needs. There was no evidence of gambling in his past or at the trial. There is no evidence of any other addiction. Nor do the circumstances of the robbery suggest any pathological disturbance or any other mental imbalance. The only need that I can fathom is a drug related one. I am satisfied the offence was a drug related crime. I am satisfied the offender seeks to minimise and under-report his drug abuse in the community seeking to hide it from his family and his girlfriend.Character and Criminal History: 28 This offender appears to be well regarded and supported by his mother and sister. Yet again, I see there is a contingent of persons related to him and associated with him present in court. There appears to be some reconciliation with his father. He appears to have work experience and a sometimes willingness to work. He does, however, have a growing catalogue of criminal offending. In February 2001 he was travelling in a stolen conveyance and had goods in his custody reasonably suspected of being unlawfully obtained. These matters were resolved by fines. Seven days after these matters he was charged with an armed robbery. Four months later he was charged with armed robbery and assault with intent to rob whilst armed with a dangerous weapon. It is likely these last two offences were committed whilst he was on bail. Whilst on parole he committed this offence. A little over a week later he was charged with having custody of a knife in a public place. For that last offence he received a six month term of imprisonment. That term has been served subsequent to his incarceration. Attitude to Offence: 29 The trial was hard fought. It was a trial dependent upon identification evidence coming from the victim. The jury was given every reason by the defence to come to another verdict. The offender claimed to have been elsewhere, that claim was supported by sworn evidence of alibi from his sister and his girlfriend, both of whom produced diary entries in support of their evidence. The jury no doubt considered the evidence carefully before rejecting it. Consequently there is no evidence suggesting insight into, or contrition for the offence before me.30 While the alibi evidence may be relevant to my assessment of the offender’s rehabilitation prospects, it is not otherwise a matter that aggravates his criminality.Breach of Conditional Liberty: 31 A matter seriously aggravating this offence is it’s commission by the offender whilst on parole. His parole was given to him on condition that he be of good behaviour. His commission of this offence in breach of that undertaking, so far as this offence is concerned, aggravates his criminality for it.Rehabilitation Prospects: 32 One of the matters that brought success to this offender when he appealed to the Court of Criminal Appeal in respect of some of the offences earlier mentioned was his rehabilitation prospects. His prospects are still good but the question of whether he is willing to grasp them is a more clouded proposition. He has strong family support and support of his fiancé. He has a vocational path, hairdressing mapped out for him. He enjoys good physical health. His mental health issues appear to be manageable with and respond to medication when required. He is, at least insofar as where he will live and work, and also with whom he will live, formulating post release plans and goals. He has community based support from neighbours and associates. 33 There are some negative factors to be considered. He has a history of recidivism. To the extent that the future can be predicted by past history, his recidivism needs to be addressed. His work history is sporadic at best. His income stream has not been identified. He has a past extensive history of drug abuse, an absence of drug treatment and a willingness to deny drug involvement. As I remarked, his prospects appear good but it is how he responds to them that will be determinative.Setting the Sentence: 34 This is an offence in which general deterrence must necessarily be a component of the sentencing outcome. In modern Australian Society there is an extensive raft of criminal laws passed by the Federal and State Parliament. The chief purpose of the criminal law put in place by Parliament is to deter those who are tempted to breach the provisions of the criminal law. Parliament does that by prescribing maximum penalties for those engaged in criminal law with a view that the maximum penalties will deter others from offending. 35 Consequently when a person is sentenced for a breach of the criminal law he is exposed to the possible maximum penalty provided by the statute breached. In this case the maximum penalty is one of twenty years imprisonment. Sentencing for breaching of the criminal law requires the Judge to keep in mind the general deterrence aims of the criminal law for the community at large, by keeping in mind that maximum sentence which was set with deterrence in mind. There is also a specific deterrence aimed at individuals likeminded to this offender who but for such deterrence, would be willing to commit crimes similar to those for which this offender is being sentenced. 36 Finally there is a component of deterrence to be considered which is personal to the offender, with a view to deterring him or her from re-offending.37 The starting point in all sentencing is to understand the purpose of the sentencing proceedings: 
     
      
      “The purpose of the Criminal Law in punishing people is to prevent others from committing a like crime or crimes. Its prime purpose is to deter people from committing offences. It may be that there is an element of retribution in the criminal law so that when people have committed offences the law considers that they merit punishment. But the prime purpose is to preserve society from the depredations dangerous and vicious people. Dixon J in King v Porter (1993) 55 CLR 182”. 
      
    38 Armed robbers, using knives to terrify their victims, qualify as dangerous and vicious people because of the violence of the trauma inflicted upon their victims.Impact of Guideline Judgment: 39 Regina v Henry & Ors notes a number, I think it’s seven, criteria typical of these offences. Against that criteria the suggested guideline starts at four to five years. This offence must be viewed as exhibiting greater criminality because it is a second armed robbery and was committed whilst on parole for similar offending. Secondly the offender is entitled to less leniency than was built into the guideline because of his record of offending again with similar offences. The guideline was also predicated on a guilty plea which recognised some mitigation on that account and which recognised some insight into the offending conduct. None of these are available here. On the other hand mitigating his offending is the turbulent dysfunctional upbringing that he had, particularly from the age of eleven on.40 I am of a view the overall sentence required for this offending conduct is one of four years imprisonment. This offender has been in custody since 7 December 2005. Since that time his custody has been revoked. The revocation dating from 7 December 2005. He has also served a sentence of six months relating to his custody of a cutting instrument. I have assumed that sentence expired on 6 June 2006. 41 I intend to date the sentence I am imposing from 16 March 2006, that is partly cumulative and partly concurrent with his last sentence. In that way I can take account of the needs of totality with the two sentences that have detained him, namely his balance of parole and his six months sentence. See Callaghan v Queen (1952) 87 CLR 115. Special Circumstances: 42 I find special circumstances. The accumulation of the sentences, his youth, his need to rehabilitate from drugs in a community based setting and his reasonable rehabilitation prospects. Shortly I will be sentencing him to a non-parole period of two and a half years back dated to 16 March 2006. It will expire on 15 September 2008 that will mean that I will be setting a balance of term of 18 months to expire on 15 March 2010.Compulsory Drug Treatment Program43 A recidivist is a person who re-offends having already been convicted of and punished for an earlier offence. The Bureau of Crime Statistic reports that more than half of those going to goal for the first time re-offend. Many of those who re-offend are young men with serious drug problems. I am satisfied Ahmed Raad is a recidivist offender because of serious drug problems that he seeks to hide from his family and those interested in his rehabilitation. 44 The Government has introduced a rehabilitation program where the Drug Court is empowered to make a compulsory drug treatment order compelling recidivist offenders to participate in a drug rehabilitation programme. This Court has a duty to refer offenders who might qualify to the Drug Court for its assessment as to whether the relevant offender does, in fact, qualify. The Drug Court is the final arbiter of the eligibility. When a sentenced offender is eligible, it is the Drug Court and not this Court that will make the Compulsory Drug Treatment Order. There are eight criteria necessary for eligibility, five of them, with which I am concerned, appear to be me to be satisfied. That is, firstly that the offender is sentenced to full time imprisonment with an unexpired non-parole period of at least 18 months at the time of sentence and does not exceed three years at the time the compulsory drug order would be made. Secondly, that in the five years preceding sentence the offender has been convicted of at least two offences not arising from the same circumstances that resulted in imprisonment. Thirdly, the offender has never been convicted of murder, attempted murder, sexual assault, offences involving the use of a firearm or offences involving the supply or manufacture of a commercial quantity of prohibited drug. Fourthly, the offender’s usual place of residence lies within the broader Sydney region; and fifthly that the offender is over eighteen. There are three further eligibility criteria considered in the Drug Court, they will include these: 
     
     A consideration of whether the offender has a long term drug dependency and associated lifestyle. 
     Whether the offender’s antecedents indicate the offence was related to long term drug dependency, and 
     whether the offender should be disqualified from consideration by reason of any serious mental disorder.  
    45 This is a new drug treatment programme opened in August 2006 operating out of a designated custodial area at Parklea prison. It targets recidivist offenders with long term drug addiction who have associated life of crime and imprisonment. The programme is abstinence based. It comprises three stages. Stage one is a stage of closed detention. The offender whilst in that stage will participate in a range of drug treatment and social reintegration programmes closely monitored whilst in full time custody. That particular stage usually lasts with a cooperative offender for six months. The second stage is semi-open detention. Following successful completion of stage one the Drug Court may impose a community supervision order, allowing the offender to attend employment, training or social programmes in the community, while remaining at the Parklea prison in the evening. Stage two will last for a minimum of six months and at stage three, if he completes successfully the semi-open detention programme, the Drug Court may vary the community supervision order, allowing him to reside outside the goal at approved accommodation whilst under intensive supervision, so that employment, training and social programmes can continue into the future.46 I intend to refer this offender to the Drug Court for its assessment as to the eligibility of the offender for that programme. If he does not understand his solicitor should explain it to him.Formal Orders:47 Ahmed Raad I convict you of this offence, that you on 29 November 2005 at Riverwood when you were armed with an offensive weapon, namely a knife, robbed Nicholas Borel of his mobile phone, Festina men’s wrist watch and $300, all of which was his property. For that offence I set a non-parole period of two and a half years to date from 16 March 2006 and will expire on 15 September 2008. I set a balance of term of 18 months to expire on 15 March 2010. If you are not accepted into the compulsory drug programme your eligible date for release will be 15 September 2008, that is next year. Whether you are released or not on that date will depend upon the way in which you conduct yourself whilst you are in custody. This Court has no influence on the Parole Board’s decision. It is the Parole Board who will determine whether you are to be released, not me. You would well know this, probably better than I. 48 I refer the papers to the Drug Court and to the attention of the Senior Judge of that Court or to the Registrar of that Court for your eligibility into the compulsory drug treatment order to be determined. Is there any other order?

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL:  The appellant was convicted upon two counts, being: 
     
      
       
      1. On 6 May 1997 at a place unknown in the State of New South Wales he did detain Kerry Patricia Whelan with intent to hold her for advantage to the said Bruce Allen Burrell (contrary to s 90A of the  
      Crimes Act  
      1900); 
       
       
      2. On or about 6 May 1997 at a place unknown in the State of New South Wales he did murder Kerry Patricia Whelan (contrary to s 18(1)(a) of the  
      Crimes Act  
      1900. 
       
      
    2 The trial was conducted before Barr J and a jury commencing on 16 March 2006 and continuing until 6 June 2006. The jury retired to consider its verdicts at 12.58 pm on Wednesday, 24 May 2006. After deliberating for eight days, at 10.00 am on Monday, 5 June 2006 a juror sent a note to the trial judge which, in general terms, indicated that, at that stage of their deliberations, they could not agree and stated that further deliberations would serve no useful purpose. The juror requested that the jury be discharged. Barr J did not take this course and directed the jury in accordance with Black v The Queen (1993) 179 CLR 44. The jury returned the following day at 2.50 pm with verdicts of guilty upon both counts. 
     
      
    3 The appellant was sentenced to life imprisonment upon the murder count, the sentence to date from 23 December 2005 and a term of imprisonment of sixteen years, with a non-parole period of twelve years, both to date from 23 December 2005 upon the kidnapping count. The appellant appeals against his conviction and seeks leave to appeal against the severity of the sentences imposed. 
     
      
    4 The trial at which he was convicted was the second trial of the appellant on these charges. At his first trial the jury was unable to agree and, after deliberating for ten days, was discharged without reaching a verdict. It was agreed at the second trial that the rulings which his Honour made at the first trial would be applied at the second trial.  
     
      
       
      THE CROWN CASE 
       
      Mrs Whelan disappears 
       
      
    5 The Crown alleged that Mrs Whelan was kidnapped on 6 May 1997 and killed shortly thereafter. Her body has never been found. The appellant was arrested and charged with the kidnapping and murder on 1 April 1999. The Crown case against the appellant was entirely circumstantial. I have set out below a summary of the relevant evidence. 
     
      
    6 Mrs Whelan was married to Mr Bernard Whelan, a senior executive of a company known as Crown Equipment, which is a large multi-national company based in the United States of America. It manufactures and sells fork lift vehicles. Its Australian premises were based at Smithfield in Western Sydney. The Whelans lived on a large property at Kurrajong and were financially secure. The evidence of a number of persons at the trial was that the Whelans were a devoted couple and were equally devoted to their three children.  
     
      
    7 According to the prosecution Mrs Whelan was last seen at the Parkroyal Hotel in Phillip Street Parramatta at about 9.38 am on Tuesday, 6 May 1997. On that day her image was captured on security video footage which was tendered at the trial. That footage also contains images of a Pajero 4WD motor vehicle outside the hotel with similar features to one driven by the appellant. It was the Crown case that the appellant abducted Mrs Whelan and probably did so after she had entered his vehicle outside the hotel on that morning. 
     
      
    8 The appellant was born and raised in the Goulburn area. He worked as an advertising salesman and met his second wife, Dallas (Bromley) in an advertising company in Sydney where they had both worked. They were married in 1985 and soon after moved into a unit in Marine Parade, Lurline Bay, a seaside suburb in the eastern suburbs of Sydney. In 1998 they purchased a rural property called “Hillydale” at Bungonia near Marulan in partnership with Dallas’ parents, Les and Shirley Bromley. Both the appellant and Dallas worked for a company called “the Advertising Works.” One of the accounts that the appellant had responsibility for was Crown Equipment. In this capacity the appellant came into contact with Mr Whelan and they became friends. They shared an interest in farming and sporting shooting. They went away together on shooting trips. The appellant also met Mr Whelan’s family including his wife. The Whelans attended the appellant and Dallas’ wedding in 1985. 
     
      
    9 In 1987 Mr Whelan offered the appellant a job at Crown Equipment which the appellant accepted, becoming the advertising manager. During his employment the appellant apparently went to the Whelans’ Kurrajong property on occasions including a tennis day for Crown employees in 1989. Following the economic downturn in December 1990 the appellant was made redundant. Mr Whelan was required to bring him that news. After that time there was only sporadic contact between the two men. The last contact between them prior to 1997 was in about 1993. 
     
      
    10 After leaving Crown Equipment the appellant drifted from position to position. He did not stay long in any job and was largely living off the income of his wife which she gained as a graphic artist. They lived in the unit in Lurline Bay. During this time the relationship between the appellant and his wife deteriorated. In early 1994 Dallas was struck with a particularly serious form of cancer and underwent an extended period of chemotherapy, although she managed to keep working. In 1994 the appellant acquired a green, two door, 4WD Pajero. He also acquired a Jaguar motor car. In 1995 Dallas opened her own advertising business, Burrell Advertising and Design which prospered. The Crown alleged that the appellant became resentful of her success and began to spend more and more of his time at Hillydale on his own. 
     
      
    11 In May 1996 Dallas decided to separate from the appellant. In December 1996 they reached a financial settlement which necessitated each of them borrowing $125,000 in order to buy out Dallas’ parents’ interest in Hillydale. The appellant ended up owning Hillydale, which became his home, but he had difficulty coping with the mortgage payments. The Crown alleged that by early 1997 the appellant’s financial position had become extremely precarious. For the period July 1996 to May 1997 his income was essentially dependent on some occasional sales of live stock, a motor vehicle and a tractor together with “loans” from his father. Incoming funds from this period totalled about $26,000 while outgoings totalled almost $42,000. When interviewed by the police on 21 May 1997 the appellant indicated that as at April 1997 he had not effectively worked for a wage for a number of years and that he had had to borrow money from his father to exist for the previous six months. At 1 April 1997 his bank balance was $941.97 which was insufficient to meet the current month’s loan repayment or any other of his regular expenses. 
     
      
    12 The Crown alleged that in January or February 1997 the appellant asked another friend and former work acquaintance, Mr Peter Sean Buckley, who was then a director of a motor vehicle parts company, Ultratune, if he could give the appellant a letter saying that the appellant worked at Ultratune so that he could present it to a bank to obtain a loan. The appellant allegedly said to him: 
     
      
       
        
        “you have got to help me out, I need to refinance, I need some money, I promise you I’ll pay the money back … Can you help me refinance my house? … Will you give me a fictitious letter of employment that shows that I work with your company for $50,000 or $60,000 a year so I can take that to the bank and get a loan.” 
        
       
      
    13 Mr Buckley refused to provide such a letter, saying that he was not going to be involved in that sort of thing. The appellant sought to obtain money from Ultratune in return for some assistance that he could give in some litigation in Melbourne. Subsequently the appellant was on the phone to Mr Buckley regularly asking him for money. Mr Buckley gave evidence that the appellant was “very, very desperate’ and pestered him repeatedly. At one stage, trying to put him off, Mr Buckley said to the appellant that he would try to help out, depending on his cash flow. The appellant apparently replied: “Look you, you know, you better fucking get the money … make it fucking happen.” 
     
      
    14 Mr Buckley became apprehensive after this exchange and went to lengths to avoid the appellant. As it happens he did not provide him with any financial help. 
     
      
    15 The Crown alleged that this exchange with Mr Buckley reflected the desperate state of the appellant’s financial position in the first few months of 1997. The Crown emphasised that the appellant not only made demands upon his friend but sought to involve him in a significant fraud of a bank in order to enable him to obtain money. He was unemployed and had not received any substantial income for a number of years. His ability to rely upon his wife for money had ended with their marriage.  
     
      
    16 Notwithstanding the appellant’s impecunious position there was evidence of his planning significant investments, in particular in Tasmania. He allegedly proposed to a female friend, Ms Cathie Tulloh, that she might move with him to Tasmania where he said he had been looking for a property to buy. The evidence disclosed that the appellant had made enquiries about purchasing a property in Tasmania from Benjamin Wagner, project manager of Tasmania Development and Resources, where he proposed to set up a winery. He was told the minimum cost would be about $600,000 to $750,000. He also had ideas of spending money on the cottage at Hillydale. When the property was searched in May 1997 the police found a note written by the appellant showing planned improvements totalling $62,000. The Crown alleged that although the appellant’s true financial situation precluded either the setting up of a winery or the improvements to his property, his plans were consistent with an expectation of a sudden and significant improvement in his financial situation. 
     
      
       
      The appellant phones Mr Whelan 
       
      
    17 The appellant rang Mr Whelan on 7 April 1997. He had not spoken to him for at least four years. The circumstances were that the appellant rang Crown Equipment and asked to speak to Mr Whelan. Mr Whelan was not there and his secretary took a message. That night Mr Whelan rang the appellant from his home at Kurrajong. Mr Whelan said the conversation mystified him. Although Mr Whelan expected to be asked for a favour or assistance that request never came. To Mr Whelan the conversation seemed to be “pointless.” There was just a general conversation about both their families. During the conversation Mr Whelan told the appellant that it was usual for him to go to Adelaide to attend work meetings each Wednesday or every second Wednesday. He also disclosed that he was frequently required to travel to other offices of Crown Equipment both interstate and overseas. The Crown case was that the appellant’s real purpose for the call was to find out Mr Whelan’s movements. 
     
      
       
      The appellant visits the Whelan home on 16 April 1997 
       
      
    18 The next occasion on which Mr Whelan was away in Adelaide was on Wednesday 16 April 1997. On that morning the appellant turned up, without having previously indicated that he would do so, at the Whelans’ property at Kurrajong. He had driven there from his father’s home at Balgowlah in Sydney, where he had stayed overnight. He was driving a Jaguar motor car. When he arrived at the front entrance to the property he found the gate locked. There was a coded keypad which had not been there when he had previously visited the property. The gate was situated a considerable distance from the house. Although the evidence confirmed that he had a mobile phone with him in his car, the appellant did not use it to call Mrs Whelan. Instead he drove to North Richmond a distance of approximately 10 to 15 kilometres and called the Whelan home from a public phone. The telephone was answered by Ms Amanda Minton-Taylor, who was the Whelans’ 31 year old nanny/horse trainer. At home on that day was Mrs Whelan and her 11 year old son, James Whelan. The appellant told Ms Minton-Taylor that he was an old friend popping in to say hello. Ms Minton-Taylor could not find Mrs Whelan at that time but she gave the appellant the keypad number with which to open the gate. 
     
      
    19 The Crown case was that the appellant travelled back to North Richmond to make the telephone call so that he would not leave a trace of his presence at the Whelan farm on his mobile telephone record. The appellant later told the police that he either did not have his mobile phone with him on 16 April 1997 or, if he did, that he may have tried it and there was no signal. Evidence gathered by the police contradicted both of these suggestions. The appellant had an analogue mobile phone. Tests showed that there was a good analogue signal at the front gate of the Whelan property, although it diminished in one location 200 metres from the gate. After visiting the Whelan property and while returning to his father’s home, the appellant used the phone at Ryde to call his father. The Crown’s explanation for the appellant returning to North Richmond has a possible flaw. If, as happened, the telephone was answered by a person other than Mrs Whelan it would not matter a great deal whether the telephone call was made from a mobile phone, which could be traced or from a public telephone. However, it was the Crown case that the appellant had anticipated that Mrs Whelan would be at home alone and that he intended to kidnap her on that day. It was for this reason that he did not wish any record of the telephone call to be available.  
     
      
    20 After speaking with Ms Minton-Taylor the appellant drove back to the gate which he opened and continued to the house. He was met by Mrs Whelan and was introduced to Ms Minton-Taylor. Ms Minton-Taylor said that Mrs Whelan showed no signs of distress or anxiety. The appellant was overheard by James Whelan to say that he had called by because he “just went to the pistol club at Lithgow.” This statement was false as the appellant had not been to the pistol club and was not on his way to it. Some weeks later the appellant told the police that he had gone to the Kurrajong property that morning to see Mr Whelan to ask him for some freelance work after having unsuccessfully tried to contact him at Crown Equipment. Relevant staff at Crown gave evidence that no one had rung that morning in an endeavour to speak to Mr Whelan.  
     
      
    21 Mrs Whelan and the appellant had a cup of coffee in the garden whilst Ms Minton-Taylor occupied herself in the kitchen or with work in the stables. Nobody heard what they spoke about but, when the appellant was interviewed by the police some weeks later, he said that he had told Mrs Whelan of his quest for work. He said that she had offered to intervene and speak to Mr Whelan about it, but that he said that he had declined her offer as he wanted to do it directly himself. When he left, Ms Minton-Taylor saw the appellant give Mrs Whelan a kiss on the cheek. She said that after he had gone Mrs Whelan spoke with her and said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Can you do me a favour? You never saw him here. Don’t tell anybody. Give me a couple of weeks and I’ll tell you why. I said ‘Okay.’ Kerry said ‘Don’t worry’ and half laughed and said ‘I am not having an affair.’ Her facial expressions looked as if she meant what she said. She said ‘with this body and held her arms out suggesting that her size and appearance was not attractive. Somewhere through the conversation Kerry said “it’s a surprise.” 
        
       
      
    22 She also gave evidence that after a couple of minutes, while she was standing beside the kitchen bench, Mrs Whelan said in a soft voice muttering to herself “that bastard, why did he do this to me.” She said that Mrs Whelan “wasn’t directing this to me, she appeared to be saying it to herself.” 
     
      
    23 When the appellant was interviewed by police in May 1997 he denied making any arrangement to meet Mrs Whelan on an occasion subsequent to his visit to Kurrajong. It was the Crown case that such an arrangement had been made and that they were to meet at 9.30 am at the Parkroyal Hotel in Parramatta on Tuesday, 6 May 1997. One Crown theory was that this arrangement had been made so that the appellant could go with Mrs Whelan to see Mr Whelan at Smithfield to ask for work. 
     
      
    24 It was the Crown case that there was no explanation for the appellant coming to Kurrajong that morning (on 16 April 1997) except to pursue his sinister intentions. Being aware from his earlier phone call to Mr Whelan that he would be in Adelaide that Wednesday, the Crown case was that the appellant expected to be able to kidnap Mrs Whelan on that day. 
     
      
       
      The events of 6 May 1997 
       
      
    25 On Tuesday, 6 May 1997 three weeks after the appellant’s visit to Kurrajong, Mrs Whelan was due to meet her husband at about 3.45 pm at his office at Crown Equipment. They were to travel together to Adelaide that afternoon. Mr Whelan left home that morning at about 8.00 am and spent the day at work. Mrs Whelan told her husband that she was going to Parramatta to visit a beautician or skin specialist. In fact her diary for that day contained the bland entry “9.30 am.” The evidence was that Mrs Whelan normally wrote in her diary the time and purpose of any engagement. Police enquiries failed to reveal any beautician or skin specialist in Parramatta with whom Mrs Whelan had an appointment that day. 
     
      
    26 Mrs Whelan left home and drove to the Minton-Taylor home at Glossodia arriving at about 8.20 am. She spoke to Ms Minton-Taylor and her mother, Marjorie Minton-Taylor (who was a good friend of the Whelans and who, together with her husband, was intending to join the Whelans on a holiday they had planned in Europe later that year). Mrs Whelan apparently mentioned that she had an appointment at Parramatta at 9.30 am and she was then going to go shopping. Mrs Whelan left the Minton-Taylor home at about 8.45 am. On the way to Parramatta she spoke briefly to Mr Whelan on the telephone from her car. The evidence indicated that on that morning she was cheerful and showed no anxiety or preoccupation.  
     
      
    27 At 9.35 am Mrs Whelan was observed on the security camera to drive into the underground car park of the Parkroyal Hotel in Phillip Street, Parramatta. She often used this car park when she went to Parramatta. She had previously told her husband that she was going to park there on that day. The hotel and its car park have a security system comprising a number of cameras with a video recorder. The system recorded a series of still black and white images from up to 8 cameras located at various sites around the premises. Each shot lasted only a second or two so that there was a break of a number of seconds between successive shots from the same camera. Mrs Whelan’s car was filmed entering the car park via the ramp from Phillip Street. She was filmed walking out of the car park along the right hand or western side of the same ramp into Phillip Street. The last shots of her at 9.38:03 and 9.38:08 showed her exiting the ramp. She did not deviate to her left and she either crossed Phillip Street or turned west. 
     
      
       
      Events at the Parkroyal Hotel 
       
      
    28 When she left the car park up the ramp, Mrs Whelan walked in the right hand lane and adjacent to the right kerb. Her image disappeared into the light while she was still on the right hand side of the car park entry. The defence case was that she was later observed in a position which would have meant that she had walked to the left. However, that evidence is entirely inconsistent with her movements as shown in the video recording and in my view can be put aside. If she did not turn right having left the car park entry the only other rational direction for her progress was straight across Phillip Street. 
     
      
    29 The Crown case was that a Pajero 4WD like the one in the appellant’s possession, was seen in camera 7 apparently moving away from the kerb on Phillip Street outside the Parkroyal Hotel heading east across the front of the hotel car park ramp. It was contended that this was the means by which Mrs Whelan left the vicinity of the hotel after she had met the appellant outside. The Pajero vehicle was seen in camera 7 at 9.38.45/46. 
     
      
    30 Earlier that morning, at 9.01:24 am, a similar Pajero 4WD vehicle was also seen passing outside the Parkroyal Hotel. However, it was not possible to observe whether it stopped or merely moved past the hotel. It was the Crown case that because this vehicle was seen in camera 2 but not in camera 7, which would have been the sequence if the vehicle had continued to move, the vehicle observed at 9.01:24 am had parked outside the hotel. The Crown case was that this was the appellant’s vehicle and that he waited at the kerb until Mrs Whelan arrived. 
     
      
    31 There was no observation of Mrs Whelan entering any vehicle. However, the Crown relied on the absence of any image of Mrs Whelan being captured on the hotel’s CCTV footage which covered pathways she could have used to move away from the hotel. The Crown also relied on the evidence of Mr Poras Shar who had left the car park using the ramp at the same time and in the same direction as Mrs Whelan. His evidence was that Mrs Whelan had turned right at the top of the ramp which meant that she would have walked towards where the Crown alleged the Pajero was parked. However, Mr Shar believed that Mrs Whelan had walked towards a white vehicle and not a 4WD. The Crown contended that in this respect he was mistaken and his recollection may have been confused by seeing a white sedan parked across the other side of the road which was observed on camera 7 at 9.38:45 am. 
     
      
    32 The police conducted a survey of owners of Pajero 4WD vehicles. Amongst others, two persons, Mr Morales and Mr Cox responded. Mr Morales initially completed his form indicating that his Pajero 4WD was in Phillip Street on the morning of 6 May 1997 in the vicinity of the Parkroyal Hotel, although he later retracted this claim. There were a number of phone calls recorded on his mobile phone as being made via the Parramatta mobile phone cell to a Mr Parassas, who was a person who he visited at various times in the course of his work in Phillip Street, Parramatta. 
     
      
    33 Mr Cox initially said that his vehicle was not in the vicinity of the Parkroyal Hotel on that morning. However, he later recalled that he had been at the Parkroyal Hotel on the relevant morning to attend a sunglasses exhibition. When the police attended his home to make further enquiries he indicated that he was not certain his vehicle was outside the hotel at the relevant time. However, when he saw a photo in the media during the inquest in 2003 he came to believe that he could observe his vehicle in the photograph identifying it from the fact that his vehicle and, he believed, the vehicle in the photograph, were fitted with non-standard wheels. He ultimately concluded that it could not be his vehicle because he was not observed on the video footage leaving the hotel that morning. He also recalled the position of a table from which tea and coffee was being served that morning and the video footage did not show it in the position he recalled.  
     
      
    34 Although he concluded that he did not attend the Parkroyal Hotel that morning, Mr Cox was definite that the vehicle depicted in the video was fitted with non-standard “mag” wheels. However, Mr Robilliard who worked for Mitsubishi gave evidence in which he stated that there was not sufficient detail available from the video images to make a determination in relation to the wheels which were fitted to the vehicle shown in the video. 
     
      
    35 The Crown argued that the vehicle caught in the security footage at 9.01:24 am had a dirty rear windscreen similar to the rear windscreen of the appellant’s vehicle when it was subsequently inspected by the police on 16 May 1997. Examination of the video footage confirms that the windscreen was dirty, the path of the wiper blade having cleaned it in part. 
     
      
    36 Camera 6, which was inside the main lobby of the hotel facing out into the driveway and also into the street did not show Mrs Whelan at all after she left the car park. This precludes the possibility that she continued walking along the footpath or the street for any distance in a westerly direction or that she entered the hotel. However, there was another camera (camera 7) situated on the hotel frontage to Phillip Street just above the carpark ramp which pointed inwards away from the street towards the glass doors of a nightclub. Although the camera faced away from Phillip Street it was possible to see a reflection in the glass doors of a section of the Phillip Street roadway outside the car park ramp. The Crown alleged that this camera got a glimpse of the top of Mrs Whelan’s head as she exited the car park ramp to the right (west). It was submitted that this precluded the possibility that she crossed the road. It was also submitted that the fact that she was not seen afterwards by camera 6, or camera 7, precluded the possibility that she crossed the road or that she walked up the street to the west or that she entered the hotel. It was the Crown case that the only reasonable conclusion was that Mrs Whelan entered a vehicle parked outside the hotel. 
     
      
    37 As at 6 May 1997, the appellant was in possession of a 1993 Mitsubishi Pajero GLS, 2 door, 4WD vehicle. It was two-tone in colour, with the predominant colour being “Hanover Green” and it had a bull-bar and a running board but no roof racks. The 2 door Pajero was a relatively uncommon car.  
     
      
    38 At 9.38:46 am, 43 seconds after Mrs Whelan exited the car park ramp, camera 7 recorded a two door Pajero pulling out from the kerb lane just to the west of the carpark ramp, and proceeding in an easterly direction down Phillip Street. It was the Crown case that an indistinct passenger could be seen in the front seat. The Pajero caught on the camera was a two-tone, 2 door 4WD, and was a model made between 1991 and 1997. It was the Crown case that the vehicle on the video was consistent with the car owned by the appellant. 
     
      
    39 Extensive investigations by the police disclosed that there were only 1,716 two door Pajeros of the relevant model produced and sold in Australia in the years 1991-1997. Police contacted many of the owners of these vehicles who indicated that they had not been at the Parkroyal Hotel that day. The value of this evidence may be doubted. If a vehicle owned by another person had been involved in the kidnapping it is unlikely that its owner would have confessed to being in the vicinity of the hotel on that morning. However, on the Crown case the coincidence that 43 seconds after Mrs Whelan emerged into Phillip Street a vehicle of a kind similar to the appellant’s pulled out of the kerb was alleged to be of significance. The other camera inside the lobby of the hotel did not record Mrs Whelan as having walked along Phillip Street past where the vehicle was parked. The Crown case was that the irresistible conclusion was that she got into the vehicle seen by camera 7, the same kind of vehicle as that possessed by the appellant. 
     
      
    40 When Mrs Whelan failed to meet her husband on the afternoon of 6 May 1997 he went searching for her car and found it in the car park of the Parkroyal Hotel. He then alerted the police and began a search for her. 
     
      
       
      The ransom demand 
       
      
    41 On the following day, 7 May 1997, Mr Whelan received a ransom demand by mail at his home. It was in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “There will be no second chances. Follow all instructions or your wife will die. 
        
       
       
        
        By the time you receive this letter she will be safely in our keeping. 
        
       
       
        
        To ensure her safe return you must at no time bring in the police the press any authorities or outside assistance. We will know if you do so. 
        
       
       
        
        The consequences of breaching tis rule will be dire for your wife. 
        
       
       
        
        You are not our first Australian target there have been others. You have not heard of this in the past because they have implicitly followed all instructions and been reunited with there loved ones. 
        
       
       
        
        Do no underestimate our capabilities. 
        
       
       
        
        We will know if you breach any conditions at any time and you and your family will not see her again. This is our only garantee. 
        
       
       
        
        The ransom for her return in one million US dollars. The rate of exchange means you will pay one million two hundred fifty thousand Australian dollars to be paid in one hundred dollar Australian notes. Ensure only the new plastic notes are used. No paper currency. No consecutively numbered notes. The money is to be delivered in a heavy duty green plastic garbage bag. 
        
       
       
        
        The money is not to be photo copied. No remote transmitting devices. No radio active dusts. No dyes. No means of tracing the money is to be used. 
        
       
       
        
        We are able to scan and test for all such devices and any other method you may use. Do not be tempted for if anything is used to trace the money it will not be collected and your wife will die. No further contact will be made. 
        
       
       
        
        You have seven days. When the money is ready you are to put an advertisement in the public notice section of the Sydney Daily Telegraph newspaper saying: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘Anyone who witnessed a white Volkswagon beetle parked beside the eastern gates of the Sydney Olympic site at 10.30 pm on Tuesday 8.4.97 please call …. then put your home telephone number at the end of the advertisement. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        After the advertisement has been in the newspaper we will be in contact within three days at your home to tell you the next step. Be ready to leave with the money at any time. 
        
       
       
        
        The money is to be delivered by you and nobody else. Do not substitute yourself for the delivery. You must be alone. Have no wires on yourself or in the car you use. We will know if you try to use them. Do not use the car radio. 
        
       
       
        
        Any sign of outside involvement or interference and your wife will die. 
        
       
       
        
        We will be aware of everything you do. Take cae this is your only means of ever seeing her alive again.” 
        
       
      
    42 The demand had been posted the previous day and processed through the south-west mail centre at Leighton Field. This meant that the letter must have been posted somewhere in an area bounded by Bargo to the south, Silverwater to the north, Merrylands to the west and Bankstown to the east. The ransom letter was consistent with having been typed on a Cannon typewriter, using a Cannon Orator 10 daisy wheel. The appellant had a Cannon QS 100 typewriter in his possession at the time, but the daisy wheel and ribbon cartridge found in it were conclusively shown not to have been used to produce the ransom letters. 
     
      
    43 It was the Crown case that the reference in the letter to excluding the police and outside involvement were completely inappropriate in the circumstances in which the note was received. It was the Crown’s contention that the letter had been drafted with the expectation that the family would receive it before it was realised that Mrs Whelan was missing. Because it was posted at least a day and possibly two after Mrs Whelan’s disappearance the warnings about contacting the police were meaningless, because the family, in all likelihood, would already have notified the police. For this reason, the Crown case was that the letter had been written with the intention that the abduction of Mrs Whelan would occur from the family home on 16 April 1997 at which time the ransom letter would be left. Because other persons were present at the home on that occasion the appellant was unable to carry out his plan but did not alter the terms of his ransom letter before it was ultimately posted. 
     
      
    44 The relevant advertisements were subsequently inserted in the Daily Telegraph on 13 to 20 May 1997 inclusive. On 13 May 1997 the appellant was seen purchasing a Daily Telegraph newspaper. However, the advertisement prompted no response from any person. The defence case was that the fact that the appellant purchased a Daily Telegraph was of no moment as it could have been his regular daily newspaper. 
     
      
       
      The “false sighting” evidence 
       
      
    45 There was other evidence relating to Mrs Whelan’s movements on the morning of 6 May 1997. It was characterised by the Crown as “false sighting” evidence.  
     
      
    46 Mr Norman Elliott gave evidence. He said that he had observed Mrs Whelan a couple of weeks previously in a café in the Greenway Arcade at Parramatta. He said he noticed her because he found her appearance to be attractive. He said that on visiting the Parkroyal Hotel on the morning of 6 May 1997 he recognised Mrs Whelan as she was walking up the carpark ramp. He said he recognised both Mrs Whelan and the scene of her walking up the ramp when pictures were shown in the media some weeks later. He said that having entered the hotel he left it 4 or 5 minutes later, placing his exit well after the Pajero was seen to pass the front of the hotel ramp at 9.38:45. He said that he saw Mrs Whelan talking to a man across the other side of the laneway, immediately to the east of the hotel. The Crown submitted that Mr Elliott’s evidence was unreliable because he initially said he entered the hotel through the revolving doors at the western end of the foyer and used the bathroom behind the reception desk but he could not be seen on the security camera at that point entering or exiting the hotel. He also described the man walking up the ramp behind Mrs Whelan (who if his recollection was correct must be Mr Shah) as caucasian and did not recognise him when he was brought into court during the 2005 trial. Mr Shah was from India and was of dark complexion.  
     
      
    47 Mr Elliott conceded that given that he had parked to the east of the hotel it was more likely he entered the hotel having immediately crossed the front of the car park driveway by the doors at the eastern end of the foyer and used the bathroom at that end of the foyer. Given the configuration of the cameras and relevant obstructions he would not necessarily have been picked up by the security camera if he took this path. It was contended on behalf of the appellant that Mr Elliott may have been mistaken about Mr Shah’s appearance because Mr Shah was coming from the dark of the car park and from a position lower than Mr Elliott and, more importantly, because Mr Elliott’s attention was focused on Mrs Whelan who he recognised and not on Mr Shah. Mr Elliott remained convinced that he had seen Mrs Whelan that morning at the relevant times and in the circumstances he described. 
     
      
    48 There was also evidence from Mrs Frances Carter who worked in Parramatta and said she saw Mrs Whelan that morning with a man in George Street near the Octagon building. She said she paid considerable attention to this person because she appeared distressed and kept staring at Mrs Carter who immediately afterwards thought that she may have needed help. She was quite certain it was Mrs Whelan when she visited the caravan set up outside the Parkroyal Hotel and saw her photo and the mannequin which had been displayed. She also said that she recalled the diamond ring that Mrs Whelan was wearing. She said that she was 80 to 90% sure it was the same ring. She said that she took a keen interest in jewellery because her father was a jeweller for whom she had previously worked and the ring setting was quite unusual. She said she made this observation at 10.20 am or a little earlier. A computer sketch was generated of the man she believed she observed and when it was shown to a number of employees of Crown Equipment they were of the view that it bore a striking resemblance to an ex-employee. However, when the two police interviewed the relevant man, Ivan Frank, they did not confirm this observation. The description did not match that of the appellant. 
     
      
    49 The Crown sought to attack Mrs Carter’s reliability upon the basis that it was originally recorded in her statement that her observations took place at lunchtime. She said that this was because she had not properly determined her movements that day and originally assumed it was lunchtime because that was when she normally went for a walk. She said that she realised it was earlier in the morning when she cross referenced her movements that day with her employer and remembered that she had gone for a walk earlier in the morning, at his suggestion, just after she had arrived at work because she was suffering from a headache. She was also challenged because she had said in her original statement that she believed the woman was possibly Mrs Whelan but, in her evidence, said she was quite sure about it after visiting the caravan where the mannequin was displayed. 
     
      
    50 Mrs Margaret McMurray also gave evidence. She said she saw a woman she believed to be similar to Mrs Whelan just before 9.45 am. Mrs McMurray, a councillor on the Hornsby Local Council and a property manager was on her way to meet her solicitor at the Compensation Court. The Crown suggested her evidence was of little weight because she said the woman was only similar to Mrs Whelan and that she thought the woman was in her fifties. Mrs McMurray gave evidence that although she only said the woman was similar to Mrs Whelan she did think it was Mrs Whelan and that in her view a woman’s age was quite a subjective observation. 
     
      
       
      Other sighting evidence 
       
      
    51 The Crown called other witnesses who gave evidence of having sighted Mrs Whelan after she allegedly disappeared. The evidence was not accepted by the Crown to be reliable. 
     
      
       
      The evidence of Mrs Lambert 
       
      
    52 The first witness was Mrs Lambert, a customs officer who worked at the Brisbane International airport. She gave evidence of processing out of Australia, some time in mid May, a woman who was distraught and saying she was concerned she would never see her children again, although she had noted on her outgoing passenger card that she was an Australian citizen who was only going overseas on a short holiday. Mrs Lambert believed she marked the rear of this person’s outgoing passenger card with an X for subsequent identification should the woman’s departure become a matter of investigation. Some time thereafter Mrs Lambert saw Mrs Whelan’s photo on the television news with a report regarding her disappearance. At the time of seeing her photo Mrs Lambert thought she had seen Mrs Whelan previously and later that night, when in bed, came to realise that it may have been Mrs Whelan who was the distraught passenger she had processed leaving the country. She alerted her superior the next day who alerted task force officers who were investigating Mrs Whelan’s disappearance. 
     
      
    53 When the matter was investigated the cross on the rear of the outgoing passenger cards could not be found. However, the task was difficult because the cards she processed for the period were only retained as microfiche copies. This exercise took place in 2003, many years after the alleged kidnapping. Some years later, when she was frustrated with the investigation into her report and the inability to find the cross, Mrs Lambert attended an alternate therapist for Pranic massage after which she said that she may have marked the card of a male passenger whom she processed shortly after the distraught woman she believed to be Mrs Whelan. The Crown pointed to the fact that there was no passenger listed as Kerry Whelan who departed Australia from Brisbane during May 1997. It was also submitted that, given the evidence that Mrs Whelan was a loving wife to her husband and children, she would not have left the country in that manner. 
     
      
       
      The evidence of Mr and Mrs Williams 
       
      
    54 Mr and Mrs Williams were responsible for the care of the Whelan holiday house in Port Macquarie. They gave evidence that they had thoroughly cleaned the home, particularly the bathrooms, after the Whelans had last visited and before Mrs Whelan’s disappearance on 6 May 1997. They said when they returned to the house on 24 May 1997 they found a hair on a cake of soap, make-up on a bathroom floor, what appeared to be brown discolouration-like faeces in a toilet and, contrary to its usual condition, excess water in the shower recess. Subsequent forensic tests demonstrated that the hair on the cake of soap was that of Mrs Whelan.  
     
      
    55 The Crown argued that the evidence of Mr and Mrs Williams was unreliable because after the 2005 trial, Mr Whelan’s secretary had told him that Mrs Whelan had commented a long time before her disappearance that she was thinking of dismissing the cleaners because of poor work but had decided to keep them on because of their honesty. There was evidence that Mr Williams had on occasion been careless in leaving a light on. There was a vigilant elderly next door neighbour, Mrs Ericson, who had not noticed any activity at the Whelan home during the relevant time. The Crown submitted that it was inherently unlikely that Mrs Whelan, if she was the architect of her own disappearance, would visit their holiday home in Port Macquarie. 
     
      
       
      The evidence of Mrs Woods 
       
      
    56 Mrs Woods was a hairdresser from Armidale. She gave evidence that she had a customer in her hairdressing salon in Armidale on 19 May 1997. The woman had not attended the salon previously. She said that she had not visited since. Mrs Woods said that the woman acted very strangely. She said she subsequently saw photographs of Mrs Whelan in the media. She believed that the woman in the salon was Mrs Whelan. She particularly recalled an unusual feature of the woman’s hair which was apparent in Mrs Whelan’s photograph. Mrs Woods was the wife of the Armidale District Local Police Commander. Accordingly, the defence submitted that she had an acute appreciation of the trouble which could be caused to police by reporting a false sighting of a person of interest. The defence submitted that her evidence should have been given significant weight because of her identification of an unusual feature of Mrs Whelan’s hair. 
     
      
    57 The trial judge directed the jury that they had to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Mrs Lambert, Mrs Woods and Mr and Mrs Williams were mistaken before they could convict the appellant. 
     
      
       
      The telephone call from Goulburn 
       
      
    58 Mrs Kathleen Pemberton was employed by Crown Equipment as a part-time telephonist/receptionist in May 1997. She generally worked Thursdays and Fridays. She was working on 23 May 1997 when she received a call from a male at about 9.30 am. She thought the call lasted for more than a few seconds but less than a minute. At that stage she was aware that Mrs Whelan was missing. She had not met the appellant. She took some “scattered notes” during the call and immediately after it finished contacted Mr Whelan’s assistant, Ms Mary Brady. She then made detailed notes of the call before the police arrived.  
     
      
    59 She said that when she answered the call she was immediately told to tell Mr Whelan that Mrs Whelan was okay. The caller stressed to her that the media were to be called off as were the police. She continued: 
     
      
       
        
        “he mentioned the man with the white Volkswagon. I tried to ask ‘what man and what Volkswagon?’ Each time I did try to say something I was interrupted and said just to listen and write down and take notes.”  
        
       
      
    60 She said the man told her to make notes, and he stressed again that the police and media must be called off. This was to be done “today.” When she asked “what man and what Volkswagon” the speaker said “Mr Whelan will know” and that he would be in touch again in two weeks. When she then said “two weeks is too long” the call was disconnected. Before it ended she had asked if she could put him through to someone more senior, to which the caller said “no.” 
     
      
    61 She described the caller as having a deep, husky toned voice. He did not have an accent. She described it as being neither a “posh voice” nor an “ocker voice” just “normal.” She said he used no slang words, she thought he sounded educated (by which in cross-examination, she meant only that he used no slang words and did not have an “ocker” voice). As to an estimate of age, she said “he was a mature voice, so I would say forties.” She indicated in cross-examination that this was really meant only to distinguish him from a young person or adolescent.  
     
      
    62 In December 1997 the police attended Mrs Pemberton’s home and played her seven cassette tapes of different people saying the same thing. Inspector Walsh gave evidence that these were an extract copied from an answer given by the appellant in his recorded interview, and six different police officers saying the same thing. The “identification procedure” was not recorded, but the tapes played or copies thereof were available, tendered through Inspector Walsh and played to the jury. 
     
      
    63 Mrs Pemberton listened to the calls, and picked two which she thought were the closest to the caller. She could not differentiate between the two as to which was closest. One of those was the tape recording of the appellant’s voice, and one was a police officer who had no connection with the case (in fact none of the six police who provided samples were officers at Goulburn on 23 May 1997 or in any way suggested to be possibly connected with the making of the call).  
     
      
    64 It was the Crown case, and not disputed, that the caller was a person with knowledge of the contents of the ransom note. Evidence was adduced by the Crown that Mr Whelan’s knowledge of the contents of the note was not, before 23 May 1997, spread by him beyond those immediately present at the time that it was received. 
     
      
       
      The phone call and the appellant’s movements on 23 May 1997. 
       
      
    65 The police search of Hillydale lasted for five days and involved the full-time presence of a large number of police. There was also a large media contingent present. At 7.20 am on 23 May 1997, whilst police were still searching the property, the appellant left his home by a back route on his quad-bike. He went to the property of his neighbour, Phillip Broadhead, and borrowed his car. Leaving the Broadhead property at about 8.00 am he drove the car to Goulburn. At 9.21 am, at a time when the appellant was in Goulburn, the phone call was made from a public telephone box outside the Empire Hotel in the main street of Goulburn to Crown Equipment at Smithfield.  
     
      
    66 When the appellant was interviewed by the police on 15 June 1997 he admitted being in Goulburn on 23 May 1997 and having made two phone calls from public telephones. He admitted that one of the calls was made just after 9.00 am at the post office and one 20 to 30 minutes later from the public phone box outside the Empire Hotel. He denied making any calls to Crown Equipment. His explanation for being in the Empire Hotel phone box was that he made a call to the office of his solicitor, David Tyler in Goulburn, to make an appointment. It was the Crown case that the appellant’s explanation was demonstrably false. Although he did make a call to his solicitor’s office that morning it was a call which he made from a post office phone box. That call could be timed from records kept by the receptionist at the solicitor’s office and it was the Crown case that it was not made at or around 9.21 am. The solicitor’s office was in the side street nearby and it would have been closer for the appellant to have gone to the office rather than to walk from the post office to the phone box outside the Empire Hotel. The Crown case was that the coincidence of the appellant making a call from the relevant phone box at almost exactly the time the call was known to have been made to Crown Equipment provided highly probative evidence that the appellant was involved in the abduction. 
     
      
    67 The Crown case was that the appellant admitted being in the Empire Hotel phone box at the time the call was made to Crown Equipment because he believed he was under police surveillance when he went to Goulburn and did not want to be caught out telling a lie. If he had been observed, and if the police could prove he was in the phone box at that time, a denial by him would have been very suspicious and amounted to evidence against him. It was submitted that he evaded this possibility by providing an innocent but untruthful explanation for his presence in the phone box. 
     
      
       
      J C Walsh & Sons 
       
      
    68 Ms Emma Hill gave evidence that in 1997 she was the receptionist at J C Walsh & Sons where Mr Tyler worked. Her starting time was 9.00 am. She was never late and never very early, and would arrive at 9 am or a few minutes before. A phone book tendered through Ms Hill showed that the appellant did make a successful call to David Tyler on the morning of 23 May 1997. Her record did not show the time of the call, and no phone records were available to time that call. She did not remember the time of the call. She was not approached by police until a month after the 23 May 1997, at which time she could say no more than that it was after 9 o'clock, being the time she started. Ms Hill's “estimated guess” as to the time of the appellant’s call, being the second call of the day, was that it was between 9 and 9.10 am. In cross-examination she agreed that possibly between 9 and 9.15 am would be a safer estimate of the time within which the appellant’s call had come through. In re-examination Ms Hill was asked to assume the correctness of the evidence of another witness, Jennifer Elliott, who said that she made a call at 9.30 am. On that assumption Ms Hill thought the 9.10 am mark would be better than 9.15 am because of the number of calls coming in between the appellant’s call and Jennifer Elliott's call. 
     
      
    69 The book showed Jennifer Elliott to be the tenth caller of the day and Sharon Shorrock to be the twelfth. 
     
      
    70 Sharon Shorrock gave evidence that she had a hydraulic car repair business. She usually got to work at 9.30 am - 9.45 am, after dropping her daughter off at pre-school from 9.30 am. In May 1997 she was ringing her solicitor Mark Walsh frequently. After she went through the procedure of opening windows, turning the computer on, and opening the shop, she would then turn to open the mail. That took 10 – 15 minutes. Normally she would finish those tasks about 10.00 am, then call Mark Walsh. Her best estimate at the trial, and at the time she provided a statement to police on 15 July 1997, was that she had called at about 10 am on 23 May 1997. She acknowledged that she could not recall exactly. She correctly nominated, in her statement, the fact that she did not in fact get on to Mr Walsh when she called that morning. She was cross-examined by the Crown. She acknowledged the possibility that sometimes she could have called as early as the 15 minutes between 9.30 am and 9.45 am. 
     
      
       
      Intercept 
       
      
    71 There was an intercept installed on the landline at Hillydale from 20 May 1997 to December 1997. At 6.41 am on 23 May 1997 the appellant spoke to his neighbour Phillip Broadhead, and the terms of the conversation indicated clearly that the appellant was going to get access to a car for the purpose of going into town.  
     
      
    72 Details of conversations monitored pursuant to warrants may only be released to “authorised officers”. As at 22 and 23 May 1997 the authorised officers included Detective Inspector Davis, Detective Inspector Dein, Detective Inspector Howe, Detective Superintendent Bray, Detective Inspector Henderson. According to the Investigators' records Detective Sergeant Duncan (who came to be the defence's primary focus as a possible caller to Crown Equipment) was not added to the list until the 26 May 1997. 
     
      
    73 Detective Superintendent Bray gave evidence that on 23 May 1997 he received a call from Inspector Howe about the call received at Crown Equipment. He said that prior to that he did not have any knowledge that the appellant had left Hillydale and gone into Goulburn, and did not know from any documents or conversations with other officers whether information was received by any police officer, prior to the call being made to Crown Equipment, about the appellant having left his home at Hillydale to go into Goulburn. 
     
      
    74 Detective Inspector Henderson was called but was asked nothing in chief about whether he, as an authorised officer for the intercept, received information of the Phillip Broadhead call. Although an answer in cross-examination suggested that he did receive such information, he explained in re-examination a mistaken understanding of the question, and suggested that he did not recall receipt of any such information, and did not think that he did have any knowledge of the appellant’s departure from the property until he received a call from Inspector Couch at 10.30 am. 
     
      
    75 No evidence was called from Detective Inspectors Dein, Davis or Howe as to whether they received information from the Telephone Intercept Branch as to the appellant's call to Phillip Broadhead. 
     
      
       
      Police Movements 
       
      
    76 Because the Crown expected the defence to seek to raise as a reasonable possibility that a police officer had made the call to Crown Equipment, evidence was adduced in the Crown case denying that proposition and other related matters raised by the defence. The two most senior investigators from the Task Force in Goulburn on the morning of the 23 May 1997, with knowledge of the ransom note, were Detective Sergeant Allan Duncan and Detective Ricky Agius. 
     
      
    77 On 22 May 1997 Senior Constable Turnbull (a Goulburn crime scene officer, assisting the officers of the task force) organised for the collection of various seized exhibits for transporting the following day to Sydney. Detective Sergeant Duncan was to attend to that, and Senior Constable Turnbull's duty book indicated that Detective Sergeant Duncan was advised of that proposal. 
     
      
    78 Detective Agius gave evidence that all his movements on 23 May 1997 were with Detective Sergeant Duncan. He gave evidence in chief that he commenced duty at the Academy at 1.00 am, travelled to Hillydale then to Goulburn at 8.00 am where the exhibits were signed out. Detective Agius was taken through the times in the various exhibit books; Lidcombe at 10.10 am and Parramatta from 10.40 am. He was taken to his phone records, and in particular the entry at 8:33 am which Detective Sergeant Duncan said he was responsible for (a call to his wife, introduced in the re-examination of that witness). Detective Agius said there was a ""good chance"" he was in the car at this time. He was asked in chief how long he was at Hillydale, and said ""It would have been just a case of `We're going back to Sydney - anything to be done?' - just in and out."" 
     
      
    79 Detective Sergeant Duncan gave evidence in chief that he went from the Police Academy to Goulburn with Detective Ricky Agius where the exhibits were collected, then to Hillydale and on to Sydney. His duty book contained an order of events in accordance with the evidence of Detective Agius. Detective Sergeant Duncan agreed that none of the exhibit documents in respect of 23 May 1997 pointed in any way to his attendance at any of the three locations. 
     
      
    80 None of the officers who received exhibits (Inspector Jago, Mr Miller, Robert Goetz) added anything as to who delivered them. 
     
      
    81 Detective Inspector Henderson gave evidence that his duty book for 23 May 1997 said ""Contact Analytical Labs. Confer Detective Sergeant Duncan. Confer Detective Sergeant Walsh re Bungonia"", and that the next entry was meal break 12.30 pm to 1.30 pm. Having reviewed that, he said he was of the view that he consulted with Detective Sergeant Duncan at Parramatta Police Station that day. He said that he conferred with both Duncan and Walsh, immediately prior to his lunch break at 12.30 pm - but then said he was not sure if there was something else in between. 
     
      
       
      The trip from Goulburn to Hillydale 
       
      
    82 The call from the public phone booth outside the Empire Hotel to Crown Equipment commenced at 9.21:35 am, and lasted 48 seconds. It was completed at 9.22:23 am. Detective Superintendent Bray conducted a timing exercise shortly prior to the trial. He said that the trip from the front gate of Hillydale to Mr Broadhead's took 5 minutes 8 seconds, from there to Mount Ash Road took 6 minutes and 20 seconds, and from Mount Ash Road to Goulburn took 18 minutes. That is, a total trip taking 29 minutes and 28 seconds, to which a minute or so needed to be added for the travel from the front gate of Hillydale to the homestead itself. 
     
      
    83 Phillip Broadhead gave an estimate of 25 minutes travel time from his property Inverary (through Bungonia, closer to Hillydale) to Goulburn. Sergeant Smith's surveillance duties on 16 May 1997 included following the appellant from Bungonia at 9.53 am, arriving in Goulburn at 10.13 am - a 20 minute trip. The appellant purchased alcohol in Goulburn on 23 May 1997. According to the receipt generated by Mac's Liquor the purchase occurred at 8.31 am. He collected the utility from Phillip Broadhead's at about 8.00 am. 
     
      
    84 Based on this evidence the Crown submitted that it was possible for the appellant to have left the phone box after the call to Crown Equipment and be back at Hillydale at a time which would have been recorded in the Command Post log as 9.55 am. 
     
      
    85 Officer Hamilton, the author of the Command Post Log for 23 May 1997 said that he had no independent recollection of when the white utility returned. However, he said the log entry of 9.55 am would be reasonably accurate within one or two minutes. The appellant was, according to the log, at the property for 5 minutes before departing again. Mr Broadhead gave evidence that he met the appellant at the apex about half way up his 600 metre driveway. This was either at 10.00 am precisely, as he said in evidence in chief, or a couple of minutes before as had been the effect of his evidence in 2005, and he conceded in cross-examination that could be the case. He agreed that he was not late for a pre-arranged 10.00 am meeting with his near neighbour Kevin Cooper. 
     
      
       
      Reason for call 
       
      
    86 The Crown submitted that the appellant made the calls because of the intense pressure which the police surveillance had imposed on him. On 17 March 2006 during the course of the Crown's opening address, the prosecutor said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The Crown case is that during those five days between 21 and 25 May 1997, the accused, Bruce Burrell, was under intense pressure. Not only did he have a large contingent of police encamped within view of his house, not only did he realise that he was under surveillance whenever he left and came back to the house, not only did he know that they were swarming over Hillydale, but there was a large contingent of the media camped just outside the front gate at Hillydale. Not only that, but there was extensive media publicity about this police search and about him. 
        
       
       
        
        So the Crown case is that during those five days he was under intense personal pressure, and it was because of that intense personal pressure that the Crown says he made a terrible mistake on 23 May, right in the middle of this.” 
        
       
       
      The appellant’s back pain 
       
      
    87 When interviewed as to the events of 6 May 1997 the appellant said that he was at Hillydale on his property. 
     
      
    88 Kevin and Beryl Cooper were the appellant’s closest neighbours. Mr Cooper was affiliated with a group called Landcare which amongst other pursuits replanted areas of old land with pine tree growth. His son Neil was a forester who undertook work for the organisation. At some time prior to 6 May 1997, Mr Cooper and his son had organised for an inspection to take place at two properties near Bungonia to assess them for potential pine plantation. Before 6 May 1997 Mr Cooper also had in mind asking his son and colleague when they attended to take a quick look at the appellant’s property to assess whether a portion of it commonly referred to as the “Rabbit Ears” portion may be suitable for pine afforestation. 
     
      
    89 In his record of interview given on 21 May 1997 the appellant described himself as being at the farm on 6 May 1997 and “incapacitated” by his back problems. He said that his back pain had started on the day of his father’s birthday, 2 May 1997. He said that he rang the doctor, Dr Chris Harmon. Dr Harmon gave evidence that he had written a prescription for the anti-inflammatory drug Orudis which he had pinned on the door of his surgery but it had never been collected. The appellant also said that he had contacted Ms Robyn Doolan a physiotherapist.  
     
      
    90 Ms Doolan gave evidence. She said that the appellant contacted her at about 6.30 pm on 7 May 1997 while she was treating another patient. She was booked out for the next morning but agreed to fit him in before her first appointment at 8.30 am. At about 7.30 am on 8 May 1997 the appellant called her at home saying that he felt that he would be better off to “veg out” at home that day. He told her that he had some medication he could take.  
     
      
    91 It was known that the appellant was able to travel on 5 May 1997. On that day he went to town and banked a cheque and bought some alcohol from Mac’s Liquor in Goulburn.  
     
      
    92 Both Mr and Mrs Cooper saw the appellant on 4 May 1997 when he came to get some photocopying done. He declined their offer to sit down because he said he had back pain and wanted to stand. He also declined their offer of a beer. When asked what was the problem he responded that it was the sciatic nerve in his back. Both Mr and Mrs Cooper believed that the appellant was on that occasion in pain not just from what he told them but also how he looked. 
     
      
    93 It was the Crown case that the appellant had attempted to create a false alibi. It was contended that the appellant had a problem in relation to Mr and Mrs Cooper because of the arrangements which had been made to inspect his property. Although he could have contacted them by telephone or by two-way radio, the Crown said that his reason for visiting them on 4 May 1997 was to establish in their minds that he was suffering from back pain which would provide an explanation for why he would not be there on 6 May 1997 when the foresters came to look at “Rabbit Ears.” 
     
      
    94 The Crown elicited evidence from Dallas Bromley to the effect that the appellant had not suffered any serious back injury during the course of their marriage. Although from time to time he had a sore back, she did not ever observe it to be debilitating to the extent that he could not work. Although the appellant had claimed in a record of interview that his back pain had been sufficiently severe to require his wife to take him to a doctor in Sydney she denied that this had ever occurred. 
     
      
       
      The Coopers 
       
      
    95 Mr and Mrs Cooper went onto the appellant’s property on 5 May 1997 to check “Rabbit Ears” themselves. Mrs Cooper gave evidence that on the evening of 5 May 1997 she left a message on the appellant’s telephone service indicating that she and her husband had gone in to have a look at “Rabbit Ears”. She was asked in chief whether there was any contact between her house and the appellant on 6 May 1997 and she said there was “contact in the morning, when Bruce called me back to let me know that he had received my message.” She was asked to indicate whether she could say it was a telephone call or UHF communication and she responded “After having thought about it before the last court appearance, I am definitely sure that it was a UHF call.” Her evidence was that the call was at about breakfast time, although that could have been at any time between 6.00 am and 8.00 am. 
     
      
    96 Mr Cooper gave evidence that he could not definitely recall having any direct contact by phone, radio or in person with the appellant on 6 May 1997. As far as he remembered it was his wife who had the contact which he recalled as occurring at about breakfast time.  
     
      
    97 The police intercepted a telephone call between Mr Cooper and the appellant made on 8 August 1997. The recording was tendered at the trial and its transcript read as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “BURRELL: Mate, just a quick question for you. Do you remember the day that, um – remember we were talking about putting in the pines over here up on that shaly stuff? 
        
       
       
        
        COOPER: Yeah 
        
       
       
        
        BURRELL: Do you remember, um, your son and a mate of his – well, it was up from Canberra, and they came across and had a look? (Pause) 
        
       
       
        
        COOPER: That’d be Neil and Dave. 
        
       
       
        
        B: Yeah, Neil and Dave 
        
       
       
        
        C: Yeah 
        
       
       
        
        B: That’s right. Do you – you remember that don’t you? 
        
       
       
        
        C: I remember it, yeah, but I wouldn’t know the date. 
        
       
       
        
        B: Well, mate, it was in the middle of your shearing from memory. 
        
       
       
        
        C: Well Neil was working all the time at the shearing. 
        
       
       
        
        B: Yeah, but, mate, someone – I remember they came over when they had a break or something … (pause)… and they had a look at that bloody shaly area. Remember we were talking there on the left where Dave cleared it years ago. 
        
       
       
        
        C: Yeah. Yeah, I know where you mean. Yeah? 
        
       
       
        
        B: But, mate, you rang me that day and told me that Neil had been across and had a look and said ‘Yeah, you could probably put them in but there’s not as big an area as we thought it was.’ 
        
       
       
        
        C: Mm. 
        
       
       
        
        B: You remember that? 
        
       
       
        
        C: Yeah, I remember that. 
        
       
       
        
        B: Mate, is there any way you can remember what that date was? 
        
       
       
        
        C: No, not unless … 
        
       
       
        
        B: All I’m thinking is, mate, I’ve got a feeling it was around a specific date and I’m just wondering whether if I could find – whether you rang me that day. Apparently Telecom keep records of local calls but they just don’t send them out. I’m just wondering if you make requests for them and so on: you know what I mean? 
        
       
       
        
        C: What day was – that would be in May. 
        
       
       
        
        B: Yeah, mate, it was early May. And, mate, I’ve got a feeling it was the sixth of May that we spoke – that you rang me. (Pause) 
        
       
       
        
        C: Oh, I’ve got it in the diary. 
        
       
       
        
        B: Yeah? 
        
       
       
        
        C: ‘Bruce Burrell, Rabbit Ears.’ 
        
       
       
        
        B: What’s ‘Rabbit Ears’? 
        
       
       
        
        C: That’s the name of the paddock. 
        
       
       
        
        B: Oh, is it? 
        
       
       
        
        C: That’s what we used to call it. 
        
       
       
        
        B: What’s the date on that? 
        
       
       
        
        C: The sixth of May. 
        
       
       
        
        B: You’re fuckin’ joking? Are you serious? 
        
       
       
        
        C: Yeah, that’s what I got in my diary, but I don’t know whether we went down to see it that day or not. 
        
       
       
        
        B: Kevin, do me a favour. 
        
       
       
        
        C: Yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        B: Will you make sure you hang on to that? 
        
       
       
        
        C: Yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        B: Ah, and, mate, don’t tell anybody – I, I’ll come over and see you over the weekend. 
        
       
       
        
        C: I got ‘late morning.’ … 
        
       
       
        
        B: Late morning? 
        
       
       
        
        C: ‘Di and Phil’, ‘Bruce Burrell, Rabbit Ears.’ So that’d be when Neil and Dave come down.’  
        
       
      
    98 There was then some further conversation about the entry, and the appellant again requested that Mr Cooper keep it. 
     
      
    99 There was unequivocal evidence that 6 May 1997 was the day the foresters came to Bungonia. The Crown put to the Coopers that the only contact between their household and the appellant on 6 May 1997 was the “report back” telephone call from Kevin Cooper to the appellant after the inspection. The Crown suggested that during the phone call the appellant was attempting to manipulate Mr Cooper’s memory so that he could confirm meeting with the appellant on that day. 
     
      
    100 Through cross-examination of Mr Cooper, the Crown adduced evidence that in his statement to police of 13 August 1997 he said, “I think it was around this time we were going on to Bruce Burrell’s property, and, as normal, I would have tried to contact Bruce Burrell by UHF radio to let him know I was going on to his property with the forestry people.” He also said “I cannot recall if, on this occasion, I actually spoke to Bruce on the radio or not.” He agreed that in that statement there was no mention of any call from the appellant prior to the visit of his son on 6 May 1997. 
     
      
       
      Items found at the appellant’s property 
       
      
    101 After Mrs Whelan disappeared the police concentrated enquiries on the appellant because of the information from Ms Minton-Taylor about his visit to Kurrajong three weeks previously. On 21 May 1997 a massive police search lasting five days was conducted of the appellant’s property “Hillydale”. The property was large and remote with extensive natural wilderness areas and precipitous cliffs. The site was apparently dotted with numerous disused mine shafts. No trace of Mrs Whelan was found and subsequent searches have also failed to reveal any trace of her. 
     
      
       
      The typewriter 
       
      
    102 When police searched the appellant’s premises they found a Cannon QS100 personal typewriter. The typewriter, its daisy wheel and the typewriter ribbon were carefully examined by the Document Examination Unit of the NSW Police Service to which Detective David Williams was attached. He said that the Cannon QS100 typewriter found in the appellant’s house was an electric typewriter with a plastic daisy wheel to create letters. As such, it was difficult to make a specific finding that the particular typewriter did or did not create a particular letter, a finding more capable of being made with the older style typewriters with metal keys and more workable parts likely to have faults which would be discernible in the document in question. He contacted Cannon and ascertained that the model typewriter found at the appellant’s house was provided with a single daisy wheel called a Courier 10 daisy wheel. Detective Williams’ examinations led him to the view that a Cannon QS100 typewriter could have been used to type the ransom note but that the note was not capable of having been created with the Courier 10 daisy wheel. An Orator 10 daisy wheel could have been inserted into the appellant’s typewriter to type the ransom note. The ransom note could also have been created by a completely different type of typewriter. Examination of the typewriter ribbon also indicated that it had been used for typing with a Courier 10 daisy wheel and not an Orator 10.  
     
      
       
      The appellant’s vehicles 
       
      
    103 The police also found two motor vehicles at the property: 
     
      
     the appellant’s dark green 2-door Pajero 4WD of the same kind as that seen in the security camera at the Parkroyal Hotel on the morning of 6 May 1997; and 
      
     the Jaguar in which the appellant had turned up at Kurrajong on 16 April 1997. 
      
       
      DNA and a search of the property 
       
      
    104 The police examined both of the motor vehicles in the appellant’s possession. They were examined for traces of hair or of DNA which would not have been observable to the naked eye. The evidence was that the Pajero was dusty, the interior of it being dirty. Notwithstanding the fact that the interior contained a large number of hairs and it was otherwise dirty, no relevant evidence was found. None of the hairs which were analysed demonstrated any connection with Mrs Whelan. 
     
      
    105 An intense and extensive search was conducted of the Hillydale property and surrounding areas. No trace of Mrs Whelan was located. 
     
      
       
      The “dot point” notes 
       
      
    106 The police found two notes, described as “dot point” notes in the appellant’s handwriting. The Crown case was that the first note was consistent with being an early outline of a kidnapping plan. The first note, and the Crown’s suggested interpretation of it, was as follows: 
     
      
     collection [of the victim]; 
      
     advertisement [of Bernard Whelan of the kidnapping and ransom demand]; 
      
     waiting [while the money is obtained by Bernard Whelan]; 
      
     how to proceed [in handing over the money]; 
      
     pick up [of the money] 
      
     cover all [of his tracks]. 
      
    107 The Crown submitted that a second “dot point” note which was found was also consistent with being an early outline of a ransom letter and bore many similarities to the ransom letter received by Mr Whelan. The second note, and its suggested interpretation, was as follows: 
     
      
     has been K [kidnapped]; 
      
     no P [police]; 
      
     letter within 2 days [informing Mr Whelan how to hand over the ransom]; 
      
     nothing until received [a doing nothing until the money is received] 
      
     stress “2” [no police]. 
      
    108 The Crown submitted that the similarity between the dot points and the ransom letter was stark. It was submitted that the ransom letter had the following structure: 
     
      
       
      Kerry Whelan is safely in our hands [collection; has been kidnapped]; you must at no time notify the police or the press or anyone else [no police]; the ransom is US million dollars and you have 7 days to get the money together [waiting], then place an advertisement in the Telegraph [you will be advised within 3 days] [letter within 2 days] how to hand over the money [how to proceed]; any sign of outside involvement will result in Mrs Whelan’s death [nothing until received; stress no police] 
       
       
      The chloroform and UBD directory 
       
      
    109 The police also found: 
     
      
     an almost empty bottle of chloroform which was found in a locked gun cabinet located in a walk-in wardrobe. The appellant had purchased it one to three years earlier from a pharmacy at Maroubra. The appellant alleged when interviewed that he obtained the chloroform to remove a stain on an enamel heater caused when he placed some clothing on it. His wife (Dallas) confirmed the staining but denied seeing chloroform or speaking with her husband about it. 
      
     a UBD street directory found in the Jaguar. On two pages in the directory (maps 51 and 61) which covered the area between Phillip Street, Parramatta and Crown Equipment’s premises at Smithfield, the exact location of the Parkroyal Hotel in Phillip Street, Parramatta was highlighted and the address of the Parkroyal Hotel was written in highlighter pen. Also highlighted was the route from the Parkroyal Hotel towards the premises of Crown Equipment in Smithfield, as far as the intersection of Warren Road and Long Street which is the turn off on the nearest main road to Crown’s premises. It was the Crown case that these markings on the street directory were consistent with the appellant planning to pick up Mrs Whelan from the hotel in Phillip Street and drive her towards Crown Equipment in Smithfield. It was submitted that it was a coincidence of significance that the highlighting in the directory focused on the location from which Mrs Whelan disappeared. The highlighting also showed two deviations not printed on the map, because they were changes that had been made to the road after the map had been printed. It was the Crown case that these deviations and the precise marking where the Parkroyal Hotel was in Phillip Street, showed that whoever did the highlighting had a profound knowledge of the roadway between Parramatta and Smithfield and a good knowledge of which block the hotel was in. The Crown case was that it was not consistent with the map being marked by the appellant to show the way to Parramatta because he did not know which way to go for a lunch with Mr Whelan. It was said to be consistent with the appellant marking the route of a planned abduction. 
      
    110 The defence case was that the appellant had been to the hotel previously with an employee of Crown Equipment. Accordingly, it was not surprising that the map was marked, the explanation for which was that the appellant had done this to assist his earlier travel to the hotel. 
     
      
    111 It was the Crown case that Mrs Whelan was picked up by the appellant from outside the Parkroyal Hotel in Phillip Street. It was submitted that she voluntarily entered the vehicle having arranged to meet the appellant there at 9.30 am. The Crown’s theory was that Mrs Whelan had reluctantly agreed to go with the appellant to her husband’s office at Crown Equipment to assist the appellant in his request for work. The Crown case was that the absence of any evidence of a forced abduction in the busy streets of Parramatta confirmed that Mrs Whelan must have voluntarily entered the motor vehicle. It was the Crown case that Mrs Whelan was not subdued by violence but rather the appellant used a stupefying substance, namely the chloroform of which the residue was found in a bottle at his home. Use of chloroform would minimise the opportunity for Mrs Whelan’s DNA to be deposited on the motor vehicle. 
     
      
    112 It was the Crown case that Mrs Whelan was not immediately subdued. Rather it was suggested that the appellant drove to a location between Phillip Street and Crown Equipment where there were no buildings within a radius of about 500 metres. It was at the time of her disappearance a large open area. It was also the area where the marking on the street directory finished and the Crown submitted that the appellant had carefully identified that area as being an appropriate place to stop and, using the chloroform, subdue Mrs Whelan. 
     
      
    113 The Crown case was that the highlighting in the UBD street directory was consistent with careful planning in advance as to how Mrs Whelan could be abducted without arousing attention and without creating evidence which could later be discovered. It was suggested to be the same kind of advanced planning as revealed by the two “dot point” notes. 
     
      
       
      THE DEFENCE CASE 
       
      
    114 There were a number of matters directly addressed by the defence. I have provided below a summary of the defence position on important issues. 
     
      
       
      The defence case in relation to the ransom letter 
       
      
    115 The defence emphasised during the course of the trial that typewriters of the type found at the appellant’s property were common. Furthermore, the defence emphasised that there was no forensic evidence such as finger print analysis to suggest that the appellant had in fact at any time changed the daisy wheel in his own typewriter from the standard Courier 10 with which it was supplied.  
     
      
    116 With respect to the notes which were found at the appellant’s property the defence emphasised that there were differences between the dot point lists and the ultimate letter. In particular the word “receive” was correctly spelled on the dot point list yet it was spelled “recieve” on the ransom letter. It was also suggested that the ransom letter’s request for notification by Mr Whelan of his phone number was not readily explicable if written by the appellant. The appellant obviously knew the number as he used it to telephone on 16 April 1997. Furthermore, it was emphasised that Mr Whelan was familiar with the appellant’s voice so that he could not feasibly be telephoned by the appellant in furtherance of a kidnapping. 
     
      
    117 The defence also emphasised that there was no apparent purpose in the appellant requesting the placement of the advertisement in the newspapers. If its purpose was to notify the sender of the letter, within the seven day time limit, that the money had been obtained there was no evidence on 11 May 1997 (when the appellant was under surveillance) that he left the house to buy a paper. Although on 12 May 1997 he was followed to Goulburn there was no suggestion that he was observed to buy a newspaper on that day. It was emphasised that there would be no need to place an advertisement if the author of the note simply expected that in precisely seven days the money would be available.  
     
      
       
      The dot point notes – the defence argument 
       
      
    118 The appellant refused to answer any police questions with respect to the notes found in his house. At the trial, defence counsel offered alternative explanations for the notes to those suggested by the Crown. It was submitted that they were ambiguous and that “has been K” was capable of being a reference to Keane & Co as a client, the evidence being that the appellant undertook a number of contract jobs for that firm while his wife worked there. “No P” in that context could have meant something like “No payment up front.” It was further suggested that the note could have been a response to a concerned enquiry about something having been lost “Has been kept”, “no problems”, “letter within 2 days” to explain the same, meaning not to do anything until a letter has been received. It was also suggested that the letter “K” could stand for “key” or “key word” or “key player” or “key note”, “kicked”, “kind”, “kin or “known.” It was suggested the note could have related to a prospective client.  
     
      
    119 As to the second note it was suggested that it could have related to anything connected with the appellant’s work, farm endeavours or personal life. Being of a general nature the defence submitted that it was not unambiguously related to the ultimate ransom letter. 
     
      
    120 It was submitted that the notes could have been written as long ago as 1987 when Dallas Bromley started working for Derek Keane & Co. In the alternative it was also suggested that it could have been written at least as far back as 1988 if it was in fact written at Hillydale. 
     
      
    121 The suggestion that there was no sinister explanation for the notes was said to be reinforced by the fact that the appellant took no steps to destroy the documents, even though he became aware of police interest in him from the execution of a search warrant on 21 May 1997. The defence pointed out that he had a wood fire in his home and he was left alone by the police until the documents were seized on 25 May 1997, some four days after the execution of the initial warrant. 
     
      
       
      The phone call of 23 May 1997 – the defence case 
       
      
    122 The defence relied on Ms Hill's evidence as to her starting time to draw the inference that the appellant must have been mistaken about making his first, unsuccessful, attempt to call his solicitor just after 9.00 am. It was submitted that it must have been shortly prior to 9.00 am. The appellant’s estimate of the successful call from the phone box outside the Empire Hotel, being about 20 minutes later than the first, would have placed him in the phone box at a time earlier than 9.21 am. This would have been earlier still if his estimate of about 20 minutes was even slightly inflated. 
     
      
    123 It was contended that Ms Hill's concession in cross-examination of the range of 9.00 am to 9.15 am being a safer estimate of the range of the second call was more reliable than the more limited ""guessed estimate"" in chief. The evidence of Sharon Shorrock would have supported the morning being quite slow, but within a normal range. The evidence of Jennifer Elliott, which Ms Hill was asked to assume the correctness of in re-examination, was said to be flawed in a number of respects. She was not spoken to about her phone contact with J C Walsh & Sons until 15 July 1997 - nearly two months after the call. The call she was referring to when she made her statement and gave her evidence was a call which was successful, in that she was able to speak to her solicitor Mark Walsh. She was having frequent contact with him at that time, and thought it could be that very day that she started ringing at an earlier time of about 9.30 am, because she had been trying later unsuccessfully. However the evidence of Emma Hill and Exhibit BZ made clear that Jennifer Elliott's call on the morning of 23 May 1997 was not put through to Mark Walsh. Accordingly, it was submitted that Ms Elliott was recalling the wrong occasion of phone contact when she made her statement on 15 July 1997. 
     
      
    124 Ms Hill agreed with the obvious propositions that no day was the same, some Fridays were more busy than others. Even in the busier period of 9 - 10 am there would be variations from day to day in terms of when there were bursts of calls coming in. The defence took issue with the Crown's attempt to estimate the timing of the appellant’s successful call. What was said to have been a more critical area to have pursued was the timing of the calls on either side of the appellant's. David Tyler did not know the time of the call and would not have recorded it. There was no evidence as to the length of the call. The first call of the day was from Ernest Ash to David Tyler, but there was no evidence as to when, after 9.00 am, that call came in or, for how long it lasted. Ernest Ash was not approached until 2000 (or perhaps 1998) but in any event is now deceased. The call after the appellant’s was from Don Elder, a Goulburn solicitor with an office across the road from JC Walsh & Sons. There was no suggestion that he has been questioned in relation to the timing of his call. 
     
      
    125 In essence, the defence case was that the suggestion that the appellant made an unsuccessful call from the Post Office public phone booth shortly before 9.00 am, then a successful call starting between about 9.10 am and 9.15 am, fitted in with the reliable evidence. It was emphasised that the appellant’s answers in his interview came too long after the event, and in connection with too mundane a series of events, to be treated as literally marking his movements to the minute. The timing suggested by the defence of his call to the solicitors from the Empire Hotel phone box, in light of the evidence relating to Walsh & Sons, was said to tie in perfectly with the contention as to the time by which the appellant must have departed the phone box to drive back to Hillydale and on to Mr Broadhead's. It was submitted that the time of his call was incapable of being firmly established. All that could be safely said was that the Crown did not produce evidence from which it could be said that the appellant's account of ringing his solicitor from the Empire Hotel phone box before returning home was untrue. The appellant’s estimate of the time in his interview may have been five or so minutes out, an error on which nothing turned. 
     
      
       
      The Trip to Goulburn - the defence argument 
       
      
    126 It was submitted by the defence that it was important that no tests of travel times were conducted in 1997, Detective Superintendent Bray's exercise (29 minutes 28 seconds from front gate of Hillydale to Goulburn) being conducted shortly prior to the 2006 trial. 
     
      
    127 The contrast between the state of the road in 1997 and later times was said to be significant. Both Coopers gave evidence that the trip between their place and Hillydale is over better roads now than it was in 1997. Mr Cooper said that the present owners spent money on doing up Shepherds Hill, a steep hill which used to be badly washed out at the bottom. Detective Superintendent Bray timed the journey from the outermost gate of Hillydale (that is, the edge of the property) to the Coopers' front gate as 4 minutes 20 seconds. Mr Cooper initially said 3 minutes but agreed that after giving a 5 to 10 minute estimate last year, he subsequently tested it and found it to take 4½ minutes. Mrs Cooper said that in 1997 the road between her front gate and Hillydale was just all ruts and speed humps, whereas it has now been reformed and is a much quicker trip. She said it now takes her about 5 minutes to get from her front gate to Hillydale, depending on how many gates need to be opened. 
     
      
    128 Officer Hamilton's log was said to be demonstrably wrong in so far as it recorded the appellant's arrival back at 9.55 am and departure at 10.00 am. It was said that to arrive at Mr Broadhead's as the appellant did at 10.00 am sharp (or slightly earlier) would have necessitated leaving the homestead prior to 9.55 am. Accepting that the appellant was on the property for about 5 minutes, after his return, it was submitted that he must have arrived back even before the time of 9.51 am with which Officer Hamilton was prepared to agree as a time which would be rounded up by him to ‘9.55'. 
     
      
    129 The weather was also highlighted. Inspector Couch said, when describing the constraints in searching the property between 21 and 25 May 1997, that the climatic conditions were pretty horrendous. He complained of there being very heavy rain which made the roads, which were unsealed roads, quite difficult to manoeuvre. Exhibit 23 comprised documentation from the Bureau of Meteorology tendered by the defence. It showed that the heaviest period of rain during the five days of the search was in the 24 hours up to 9.00 am on 23 May 1997 (5 mm), and that there was more in the 24 hours which followed (0.8 mm). These measurements were taken at Inverary Park, Mr Broadhead's property. Mr Broadhead's stated recollection in re-examination of 23 May 1997 being a fine day was accordingly mistaken. Inspector Couch had said that on 21 May 1997 there was a bit of rain, but that it was not what they experienced over the next few days. Mr Cooper gave evidence that if a person was not in a 4WD, the road between his place and Hillydale back in 1997 was considerably affected by rain, in a negative way and the trip became a lot slower. The road between the Broadhead's property and Hillydale was unsealed. 
     
      
    130 Inspector Couch gave evidence that between 21 and 25 May 1997 the trip from Goulburn to Hillydale regularly took three-quarters of an hour to an hour. This was travelling directly from Goulburn to Bungonia to Hillydale, not the longer route via Marulan. He said there were a couple of kilometres to the homestead on entering the property; and accepted that on arrival at the property the gates were closed and the general rule was complied with: “if a gate is closed, you go through it and close it.” 
     
      
    131 The record showed that the call from the public phone booth outside the Empire Hotel to Crown Equipment commenced at 9.21:35 am, and had a duration of 48 seconds. It was terminated at 9.22:23 am. The Crown case was that in the next 35 or 37 minutes and just before 10.00 am, the appellant got back to his car, drove back to Hillydale, spent approximately 5 minutes there and then drove all the way back to the Broadhead’s. Detective Superintendent Bray's reconstruction indicated that from the front gate of Hillydale to the front gate of Mr Broadhead's property took him 5 minutes and 10 seconds. On 23 May 1997 the appellant had to come from the house, not the front gate, was travelling on the road, which was in a worse condition than at the time of the trial, and slowed appreciably by the wet conditions, and had to enter Mr Broadhead's gate and get half way up his driveway. 
     
      
    132 Kevin Cooper said that from his place to Goulburn he allowed 30 minutes. He agreed that if he, as someone with knowledge of the road, was in a good vehicle and ""pushed it hard"" he could get there in 25 minutes. Added to this time would be the trip from the phone box back across the road, through a shopping centre and out to the car in the car park (which Detective Superintendent Bray suggested would take a couple of minutes), and the distance from Mr Cooper’s to Hillydale. The evidence of Mr Broadhead was that although the utility was roadworthy it was not powerful, and was slower than an average vehicle. 
     
      
    133 Having regard to the time which was said to be required to make the necessary movements, the defence case was that the appellant could not have left the public phone box as late as 9.22:33 am. It was submitted that if he had left the box some minutes prior to the commencement of the call to Crown Equipment at 9.21 am this would have allowed time for a police officer who had seen him in the phone box to wait for his departure to the car park and then make the call. 
     
      
       
      Inherent implausibility – the phone call to Crown Equipment 
       
      
    134 The defence submitted that there was an inherent implausibility in someone in the appellant's position making the call to Crown Equipment. 
     
      
    135 It was submitted that the evidence demonstrated that a large number of employees of Crown Equipment who were given the task of working on the reception desk and answering the phone knew the appellant, and would have been likely to recognise his voice. It was further submitted that the fact that there was no intercept on the Crown Equipment line was unusual in the circumstances, and although it was known to investigative police officers, it was unlikely to have been confidently assumed by someone in the position of the appellant if he was the kidnapper. 
     
      
    136 Balanced against these obvious risks, the defence contended that there was no point in the appellant making the call. It was said to be incredible that anyone would think that directing Mr Whelan to call off the police would result in that occurring. It was submitted that there was no need for him to have the police off the property - there was nothing incriminating on the property he needed to attend to. The police had apparently finished searching his house, although they were still coming each morning to search the land. It was submitted that it was not persuasive to suggest that he needed the police to go to make contact with Mr Whelan. When there was, on the Crown case, no surveillance of the appellant between 16 and 21 May 1997 the appellant made no contact with Mr Whelan. It was contended that there was no rational basis for urgency by 23 May 1997, some two and a half weeks after Mrs Whelan's disappearance. 
     
      
    137 Because it was so implausible that the person actually responsible for Mrs Whelan's abduction made the call, it was submitted that the Crown had resorted to the idea of a panicked mistake caused by the pressure of the police, surveillance, media presence at Hillydale and adverse media publications. However on the Crown case, he had stopped being surveilled a week prior to the call. Importantly, the defence said, that there was not a single piece of evidence to suggest that by the 23 May 1997 there was a large contingent of the media camped just outside the front gate at Hillydale, and extensive media publicity about the police search and about him. 
     
      
    138 The evidence indicated that at the time the search of Hillydale started, at 9.30 am on Wednesday 21 May 1997, there had been little media attention other than in a general way in relation to the disappearance of Mrs Whelan. According to the evidence of Detective Superintendent Bray, later that day there was a press conference held by the police at which her disappearance was disclosed. General stories in relation to her disappearance featured on some of the evening radio and television news on 21 May 1997 and were more extensively published from 22 May 1997. 
     
      
    139 The appellant’s sister, Debbie Burrell gave evidence that on Thursday, 22 May 1997 at her son's football training she heard about the disappearance of Kerry Whelan on the news. She went to Hillydale on Saturday, 24 May 1997 - a trip organised a week or two before then. When she arrived at Hillydale on that day there were police present, but no media representatives, and she did not hear anything about the media until a police officer came to speak to her brother and advise of the arrival of media personnel. Then on the Sunday the phone started ringing with callers, said by the appellant to be the media, which he complained about. After she returned to Sydney on Monday, 26 May 1997, there were constant references to her brother in the press, whereas she had seen none before she left on the 24 May 1997 for Hillydale. 
     
      
    140 Mr Allan Burrell, the appellant’s father, had also heard general publicity about the disappearance of Kerry Whelan but the first he heard of anything that was in any way connected with his son was a radio announcement early on the Sunday morning while Debbie was away [that is, 25 May 1997] that the police were searching a property in Bungonia. 
     
      
    141 The defence submission was that this evidence further undermined the Crown “panicked mistake” theory for the call, and additionally the reference in the call to the media was a mistake, not likely to be made by a person in the appellant's position (whereas it might have been made by a police officer not personally concerned about whether the appellant had been in the press, or alternatively prescient of the pending arrival to Hillydale of the media, which seemed to have eventuated on 24 May 1997). 
     
      
       
      THE APPEAL 
       
      Grounds One and Two 
       
      
    142 It is appropriate to consider these two grounds of appeal together. Ground one in the appeal was expressed in the following terms: 
     
      
       
      (a) His Honour erred in failing to direct the jury there were three indispensable intermediate facts ( 
      Shepherd v The Queen  
      (1990) 170 CLR 573) which the jury would have to find beyond reasonable doubt before being able to convict the appellant being: 
       
       
        
        (i) Kerry Whelan left the front of the Parkroyal Hotel by way of the Pajero 4WD seen in camera 7 at 9.38:45/46 on 6 May 1997; 
         
        (ii) The terms of the two dot point notes have the meanings ascribed to them by the Crown theory; and 
         
        (iii) The accused was in the phone booth outside the Empire Hotel in Goulburn at the time the subject call was made to Crown Equipment at 9.21 am on 23 May 1997; 
        
       
       
      Or in the alternative: 
       
       
      (b) His Honour erred in failing to direct the jury there were three indispensable intermediate facts (as detailed in (a) above) at least one of which the jury would have to find beyond reasonable doubt before being able to convict the appellant if they were considering convicting upon one of the three independent bodies of evidence in isolation. 
       
      
    143 Ground 2 was expressed in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        His Honour erred in directing the jury that counsel for the appellant was incorrect at law when referring to the Crown case being left to the jury upon three major bodies of evidence and that counsel said the Crown case in this regard was that the jury could find the appellant guilty on the basis of any one, two or all three of those in combination. 
        
       
      
    144 The appellant submitted that the principle to be applied in the circumstances of this case was established in Chamberlain v The Queen (1983) 153 CLR 521 and Shepherd v The Queen (1990) 170 CLR 573 being that “whilst a jury may draw inferences from facts not proved beyond reasonable doubt, if a conclusion of fact is an indispensable intermediate step in the reasoning process, that conclusion must be established beyond reasonable doubt.” Particular reliance was placed on the observations of Deane J in Chamberlain at 627: 
     
      
       
        
        “Whether or not a juror must be satisfied that a particular fact has been proved beyond reasonable doubt will, however, otherwise depend not only on the nature of the fact but on the process by which an individual juryman sees fit to reach his conclusion on the ultimate question of guilt or innocence. If, for example, the case against an accused is contingent upon each of four matters being proved against him, it is obvious that each of those matters must be proved beyond reasonable doubt. Indeed, it would be appropriate for the presiding judge to emphasise to the jury in such a case that even a minimal doubt about the existence of each of those matters would be greatly magnified in the combination of all. On the other hand, if the guilt of an accused would be established by, or a particular inference against an accused could be drawn from, the existence of any one of two hundred different matters, each of which had been proved on the balance of probabilities, it would be absurd to require that a jury should disregard each of them unless satisfied either in isolation or in the context of all of the facts, that any particular one of these matters had been proved beyond reasonable doubt.” 
        
       
      
    145 During the trial three apparently disparate bodies of evidence pointing to the guilt of the appellant were identified. I have examined them above. They were the evidence relating to the sighting of Mrs Whelan and the Pajero 4WD resembling the appellant’s at the Parkroyal Hotel on 6 May 1997; the evidence with respect to the two “dot point” notes and the phone call allegedly made by the appellant from a public phone booth outside the Empire Hotel in Goulburn on 23 May 1997. 
     
      
    146 It was debated during the trial whether, if proved beyond reasonable doubt, proof of any one or of a combination of these factual matters would be sufficient to convict the appellant. The defence case was that the three matters were indispensable intermediate facts which the jury would have to find beyond reasonable doubt before being able to convict the appellant. In the alternative it was submitted that, at the least, before the appellant could be convicted the jury would have to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the events relating to the Pajero at the Parkroyal Hotel. 
     
      
    147 The position was arguably complicated by the way in which the Crown put the prosecution case to the jury. In the course of his closing address the prosecutor identified the fact that the jury had been provided with “three completely independent bodies of evidence.” He said to the jury: 
     
      
       
        
        “If you are satisfied in relation to the Pajero evidence; namely, that it was the accused’s Pajero outside the Parkroyal Hotel, that is the end of the matter. You would have to convict him, because there is no other explanation for his vehicle outside the Parkroyal Hotel. Finished. 
        
       
       
        
        If you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that those dot-point notes contained his early thoughts about a kidnapping and a ransom note, that’s the end of it. You would have to convict him. There is no other explanation for why he would have written such notes. 
        
       
       
        
        If you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he made that call to Crown Equipment from outside the Empire Hotel on 23 May, that’s the end of it: you would have to convict him, because there is no other possible explanation other than that he was the kidnapper. 
        
       
       
        
        Now, you can look at those three bodies of evidence independently but you can also look at them all together and you can say to yourself: What an amazing body of evidence – three completely independent bodies of evidence that don’t depend on each other, each of which inevitably and irrevocably points to the involvement of the accused in the kidnapping and death of Kerry Whelan. So, we submit to you that this is a classic example of a very strong circumstantial case.” 
        
       
      
    148 However, when summing-up the trial judge was concerned to point out to the jury that their task was not confined in the manner in which they may have understood it to be from the Crown’s submission. Although he left open the possibility that they could be satisfied “on the evidence of the events at Parramatta on 6 May that the accused was the kidnapper” his Honour emphasised that they were required to consider the whole of the evidence. The relevant portion of his Honour’s summing-up was as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “Mr Dalton says to you that you cannot be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Mrs Whelan was abducted by the accused. I have told you the things you have to be satisfied about beyond reasonable doubt and that is one of them. You must be satisfied that the accused abducted, detained Mrs Whelan. 
        
       
       
        
        It is possible that you may find yourselves satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that she was detained in precisely the same way as is submitted to you by the Crown, that is to say, that the accused drove her away at 9.38 and some seconds travelling eastwards and that within some time shortly after that she was detained because she became an unwilling passenger. 
        
       
       
        
        It is not, however, necessary for you to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that that is precisely how the accused went about the detention. What you must be satisfied about beyond reasonable doubt is that, by some manner and means, and certainly by, say, a quarter to four on the same afternoon, 6 May, the accused detained Mrs Whelan. I say a quarter to four because that is about the time Mrs Whelan was due to arrive at her husband’s office at Smithfield for the journey to the airport and to Adelaide, and clearly, if she was kidnapped, she had been kidnapped by then. 
        
       
       
        
        Both counsel have said things to you in their closing addresses that may possibly lead to a misunderstanding of the law. I have told you that you are to judge this case on the evidence, and that means all the evidence. 
        
       
       
        
        The Crown submitted to you that you could be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt, on the evidence of the events at Parramatta on 6 May that the accused was the kidnapper. Whether you can be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt about that conclusion on that evidence alone, I do not know, and I express no view about it. 
        
       
       
        
        The point I wish to make now is that what the Crown said to you may have given you the impression that you can properly find the accused guilty only if this evidence, standing by itself, is sufficient to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was the kidnapper. 
        
       
       
        
        That is not the law. You are not restricted to any piece or body of evidence, when deciding whether the Crown has proved the guilt of the accused, whether the Crown has proved any essential element on either of the charges. You should judge the case on all the evidence. 
        
       
       
        
        In the same way, Mr Dalton said to you that he understood that I would be directing you that you were not restricted to a consideration of the Parramatta evidence in deciding whether the Crown had proved the guilt of the accused and he went on to refer to two other bodies of evidence; namely, the evidence of the telephone call of 23 May and the evidence of the dot-point notes found at the accused’s house. 
        
       
       
        
        Last Wednesday Mr Dalton said this at page 2328, line 33- 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘Apparently the trial will be left to you on the basis that, even if you cannot be satisfied, which in our submission you clearly cannot be, that Mrs Whelan had left by way of that Pajero outside the Parkroyal Hotel, you could still rely upon other material in the nature of the dot-point notes and/or the phone call.’ 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        Later on he said this at page 2361, line 21- 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘Still, as I understand, the matter would be left to you, even if he was not at Parramatta, even if it was not his vehicle and it was not there at Parramatta on the morning of 6 May at 9.38, we can still convict on other evidence and that other evidence will be the dot-point notes on the one hand, and/or the telephone call on 23 May.’ 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        Last Friday Mr Dalton – and I think this Monday – made a number of references saying that the Crown relied on ‘those three flawed bricks,’ referring to the Parramatta evidence, the telephone evidence and the dot-point note evidence. 
        
       
       
        
        They were not correct statements of the law. You are not restricted, in deciding whether the Crown has proved its case on kidnapping or murder, to evidence of events at Parramatta or the dot-point notes with or without the ransom note, or of the telephone call to Crown Equipment, or to any two of those bodies of evidence, or even to all three. In coming to your decision on any element of the charge, you are to take into account every piece of evidence in the case that, in your view, is capable of bearing upon your decision. 
        
       
       
        
        You already know that when you are assessing the evidence of any witness you are not required to consider the evidence of that witness in isolation. You judge it by reference to all the relevant evidence in the case. The same principle applies here and you will understand, I am sure, that there are several other pieces of evidence upon which the Crown relies, other than the three pieces of evidence to which I have referred. There is the telephone call on 7 April. There is the visit on 16 April. There is the existence of the street directory found in the Jaguar at the accused’s house. I will come to that one shortly.” 
        
       
      
    149 The appellant complained to this Court that his Honour did not direct the jury that, if they were contemplating convicting the appellant having regard to any one of the three independent bodies of evidence, a finding beyond reasonable doubt with respect to that area of evidence was required. 
     
      
       
      Intermediate Facts 
       
      
    150 I have already detailed the factual elements of the Crown case and will not repeat them in detail. However, it will be apparent that it extended beyond the three bodies of evidence which have been identified. The evidence commenced with the phone call the appellant made to Mr Whelan on 7 April 1997 and for which there was no apparent explanation. It was followed by the visit to the Kurrajong property which was itself curious. The appellant’s retreat from Kurrajong to North Richmond to make a phone call from a public phone, rather than use his mobile phone (which he untruthfully denied having on that day) was capable of a sinister interpretation, although this was denied by the defence who said it was explained by poor mobile reception in the location. 
     
      
    151 There were a number of events for which there was no explanation. In particular the comment of Mrs Whelan “why did he do this to me?” overhead by Ms Minton-Taylor after the appellant left on 16 April 1997 is unexplained. Her diary entry for 6 May 1997 showing an appointment at 9.30 am without an identified purpose and her incorrect explanation to her husband that she was going for a consultation about a skin condition contribute to a matrix of events which were unexplained. 
     
      
    152 Beyond the three bodies of evidence, there was also the evidence of motive provided by the appellant’s desire for money and his increasingly, apparently irrational, pursuit of it. The form of the ransom demand (apart from the evidence of the dot point notes) point significantly towards the kidnapper as having in mind to abduct Mrs Whelan on an occasion prior to 6 May 1997. That fact together with the evidence of the unusual circumstances of the visit to the Kurrajong property on 16 April 1997 point strongly towards the appellant having decided to kidnap Mrs Whelan on that day. That conclusion is supported by the evidence that the appellant had obtained information about Mr Whelan’s movements during the conversation with him on 7 April 1997, making it likely that Mrs Whelan would be at home alone on 16 April 1997. 
     
      
    153 The video evidence relating to the Pajero and Mrs Whelan’s movements would not persuade me beyond reasonable doubt of the appellant’s guilt. Nevertheless it makes a significant contribution to the overall matrix. Whether the Pajero, which can be seen in the earlier video, was the appellant’s, there is no doubt that Mrs Whelan arrived at the Parkroyal Hotel at 9.35 am, parked her car in the car park and left by the car park entry ramp. I have already indicated that the suggestion of the defence that on leaving the ramp she turned left was entirely contrary to her identifiable path which took her up the right hand ramp close to the right hand kerb. She gave no indication that she intended to turn left and would be likely to have already moved in that direction if that had been her intention. She either crossed Phillip Street or turned right when leaving the car park. If she did the latter she would have walked towards where, on the video evidence, the appellant’s Pajero could have been parked. At a time which was consistent with her having entered the appellant’s vehicle a Pajero, which could be the appellant’s, was recorded as moving past the hotel. 
     
      
    154 There was further circumstantial evidence. When the police searched the appellant’s property, he was found to possess an almost empty bottle of chloroform which could have been used to subdue Mrs Whelan. Although explained as being acquired for a cleaning task, to my mind this account is not convincing. The appellant’s former wife was not aware of chloroform having been acquired for any purpose, much less for cleaning. 
     
      
       
      Indispensable Intermediate Facts 
       
      
    155 In Chamberlain the High Court considered, inter alia, the correct approach to findings of fact in a circumstantial case – do they have to be proved beyond reasonable doubt? The remarks of Gibbs CJ and Mason J on that matter have been recognised as being unclear. However, in Shepherd Mason CJ made plain that only an intermediate fact, which is an essential or indispensable step toward a finding of guilt, required proof beyond reasonable doubt (p 576). 
     
      
    156 The position was authoritatively stated by Dawson J in the following passage (Shepherd pp 579-580) : 
     
      
       
        
        “As I have said, the prosecution bears the burden of proving all the elements of the crime beyond reasonable doubt. That means that the essential ingredients of each element must be so proved. It does not mean that every fact -- every piece of evidence -- relied upon to prove an element by inference must itself be proved beyond reasonable doubt. Intent, for example, is, save for statutory exceptions, an element of every crime. It is something which, apart from admissions, must be proved by inference. But the jury may quite properly draw the necessary inference having regard to the whole of the evidence, whether or not each individual piece of evidence relied upon is proved beyond reasonable doubt, provided they reach their conclusion upon the criminal standard of proof. Indeed, the probative force of a mass of evidence may be cumulative, making it pointless to consider the degree of probability of each item of evidence separately.  
         
         
        In  
        Chamberlain  
        Gibbs CJ and Mason J (1983) 153 CLR 521 at 535 accept that evidence may have a cumulative effect and point out that it is the duty of the jury to consider all the facts together at the conclusion of the case. They say:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘At the end of the trial the jury must consider all the evidence, and in doing so they may find that one piece of evidence resolves their doubts as to another. For example, the jury, considering the evidence of one witness by itself, may doubt whether it is truthful, but other evidence may provide corroboration, and when the jury considers the evidence as a whole they may decide that the witness should be believed. Again, the quality of evidence of identification may be poor, but other evidence may support its correctness; in such a case the jury should not be told to look at the evidence of each witness `separately in, so to speak, a hermetically sealed compartment'; they should consider the accumulation of the evidence.’ 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        Gibbs CJ and Mason J apply the same principle to circumstantial evidence, saying that ""in a case depending on circumstantial evidence, the jury should not reject one circumstance because, considered alone, no inference of guilt can be drawn from it"". They continue at 536:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘It follows from what we have said that the jury should decide whether they accept the evidence of a particular fact, not by considering the evidence directly relating to that fact in isolation, but in the light of the whole evidence, and that they can draw an inference of guilt from a combination of facts, none of which viewed alone would support that inference.’” 
          
         
        
       
       
      Resolution of grounds 1 and 2 
       
      
    157 In the present case there was, as I have demonstrated, a body of evidence from which the jury could conclude that the appellant abducted and killed Mrs Whelan. No one piece of evidence, or, even a discrete body of evidence, required acceptance before the jury could reach that conclusion. The jury did not have to be satisfied that Mrs Whelan was abducted in accordance with the Crown’s view of the events on 6 May 1997. It could have occurred in some other manner later that day. Nor would they have to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the “dot point” notes were the appellant’s notes made in preparation for a ransom letter or that the appellant made the phone call on 23 May 1997. All that was required, as his Honour told the jury, was that having regard to the whole of the evidence they were satisfied of his guilt to the relevant standard. 
     
      
    158 The trial judge concluded that it was necessary for the jury to be satisfied that Mrs Whelan had been abducted before 3.45 pm when she was due to meet her husband. This, of course, followed from a finding that her abduction explained her failure to meet Mr Whelan as they had previously arranged. However, the time of the abduction was not otherwise essential to the proof of the Crown case. As I have indicated, to my mind it was not an essential element of the Crown case that the appellant left the Parkroyal Hotel with Mrs Whelan on the morning of 6 May 1997. If the jury found that this occurred it would have significantly fortified the Crown case but, it was not an essential intermediate fact which required proof beyond reasonable doubt. If she had been kidnapped at some other time and from some other place that day the combination of other incriminating circumstances was such that the jury could have been satisfied of the appellant’s guilt to the requisite standard. 
     
      
    159 With respect to ground 2 there is, in my opinion, no substance in that ground. Although as I have identified the Crown submitted that there were three bodies of evidence of significant probative force, the Crown case was not confined to that evidence and the prosecutor addressed the jury with respect to the whole of the relevant evidence. His Honour’s directions, in my view correctly, reminded the jury that they were not restricted to any piece or body of evidence and could take into account every piece of evidence capable of bearing upon their decision. 
     
      
    160 I would reject grounds 1 and 2 of the appeal. 
     
      
       
      Ground 3: His Honour erred in directing the jury that any finding the jury might make that the police investigation was inadequate was not capable of weakening the Crown case. 
       
       
      Ground 4: His Honour erred in failing to direct the jury that one reasonable hypothesis consistent with innocence raised for their consideration upon the evidence was that Kerry Whelan’s disappearance was effected by a person or persons unknown. 
       
       
      Ground 5: His Honour erred in restricting cross-examination upon the police running sheets and other police documents. 
       
       
      Ground 6: His Honour erred in not permitting the contents of those running sheets he did allow to be relied upon for the purpose of cross-examination to be available for the truth of their contents. 
       
      
    161 These grounds were dealt with together by counsel for the appellant. It is convenient for me to make some general comments before turning to each ground specifically. At the heart of these four grounds of appeal is the contention that the police investigation that led to the arrest and prosecution of the appellant was inadequate, and as a result of this inadequacy there are reasonable hypotheses consistent with innocence that have not been excluded. In particular, it was argued that the Crown has not excluded the reasonable possibility that the disappearance of Mrs Whelan was effected by Mr Whelan or a person or persons unknown. It was also argued that the police investigation was biased and that this bias makes it more likely that the phone call made to Crown Equipment from outside the Empire Hotel on 23 May 1997 was in fact made by a police officer. It was contended that Barr J made a number of errors in relation to these issues. 
     
      
    162 The Crown case was entirely circumstantial. In Barca v The Queen (1975) 133 CLR 82 at 104, Gibbs, Stephen and Mason JJ said of such a case: 
     
      
       
        
        “When the case against an accused person rests substantially upon circumstantial evidence the jury cannot return a verdict of guilty unless the circumstances are ‘such as to be inconsistent with any reasonable hypothesis other than the guilt of the accused:’  
        Peacock v The King  
        [(1911) 13 CLR 619 at 634]. To enable a jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused it is necessary not only that his guilt should be a rational inference but that it should be ‘the only rational inference that the circumstances would enable them to draw;’  
        Plomp v The Queen  
        [(1963) 110 CLR 234 at 252] 
        ; 
         see also  
        Thomas v The Queen  
        [(1960) 102 CLR 584 at 605-606]. However, ‘an inference to be reasonable must rest upon something more than mere conjecture. The bare possibility of innocence should not prevent a jury from finding the prisoner guilty, if the inference of guilt is the only inference open to reasonable men upon a consideration of all the facts in evidence’ ( 
        Peacock v The King 
         [(1911) 13 CLR 619 at 661]). These principles are well settled in Australia.” 
        
       
      
    163 In De Gruchy (2000) 110 A Crim R 271, the appellant was convicted of murdering his mother, brother and sister. Two years after the offence there were two violent murders in the same general locality. A man, Van Krevel, had confessed to these two latter crimes. At his trial the appellant had sought to subpoena police documents and to cross-examine police witnesses in relation to the investigations into the Van Krevel murders, as well as in relation to murders in the Wollongong area generally. The contention was that this evidence would give rise to a reasonable possibility that someone other than the appellant had murdered his mother, brother and sister. At 281-282 Wood CJ at CL (Sully J and Simpson J agreeing) said: 
     
      
       
        
        “In the present instance the documents sought, and the line of cross-examination involved in my view, nothing more than a fishing expedition. The Arkell and O’Hearn murders occurred in June 1998, more than two years after the killings with which the appellant was charged, and his Honour, after examining the documents, saw no common modus operandi or anything in the way of physical evidence or otherwise that might link Van Krevel with the events at the De Gruchy home. Moreover, there had been no admissions by him concerning those events, whereas he had come forward to confess in relation to the Arkell and O’Hearn killings… 
        
       
       
        
        …[I]n my view, [the trial judge] was correct in excluding the proposed cross-examination both in relation to the Arkell and O’Hearn murders, and in relation to any other killings that may have occurred in the greater Wollongong or Illawarra districts. In this latter regard, counsel did not identify any particular killings, solved or unsolved, that bore any similarity or possible connection. It would have been pure speculation to float before the jury the circumstance that since other killings had occurred, so might the present killings have been the work of one or other of those responsible for them – absent that is, some identified connection. 
        
       
       
        
        Again,  
        Barca 
         is distinguishable since there was there strong circumstantial evidence pointing to a party other than the accused as having been responsible for the killing in the form of evidence going to the existence of a motive on his part, threats by him directed towards the victim and a witness, the existence of intense anger upon his part towards the victim, the fact of his involvement in another killing having a marked similarity to the case before the court, and the existence of a custom for persons of his ethnic background to carry out the very kind of offence charged in circumstances where, as it was there alleged, the honour of his daughter had been besmirched. 
        
       
       
        
        Since the matters raised did not go beyond mere conjecture as to the existence of an alternative hypothesis, I am not persuaded that his Honour erred in the approach taken, or that the appellant was deprived of an opportunity for acquittal by the exclusion of a possible body of evidence going to the O’Hearn or Arkell murders, or of any other murders that may have happened to have been committed in the general district, over an undefined period, before or after the present killings.” 
        
       
      
    164 Both Barca and De Gruchy clearly state that a hypothesis consistent with innocence must be more than mere speculation or conjecture before it can be seen as a reasonable hypothesis. This does not mean that the accused must prove it, but only that it should have some reasonable basis in the evidence before the jury. Hulme J (Sully J and Hidden J agreeing) considered this issue in McIntyre (2000) 111 A Crim R 211 at 220-221: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is, of course, both proper and common for a judge in the course of a summing up to tell a jury that they must not speculate or guess, operations of the mind quite different from the drawing of inferences. However, as his Honour pointed out to the jury, this was a circumstantial evidence case. The appellant was entitled to be acquitted if the Crown could not exclude all reasonable hypotheses consistent with innocence. 
        
       
       
        
        Such hypotheses must, as I have said, be reasonable. But a jury does not have to be able to infer that an event, the subject of such an hypothesis, in fact occurred before relying on, or making allowance for, the possibility of such an event. A couple of examples demonstrate this point. 
        
       
       
        
        A rape is committed at night in the victim’s home. The Crown presents a case based on circumstantial evidence that the offender was A. There is clear evidence that the windows of the victim’s home were open and other persons were around and acting suspiciously. A would be entitled to be acquitted as there would be a reasonable possibility that someone else was the offender. 
        
       
       
        
        A fire commences on a wooden bench on which the owner was, earlier in the day, ironing. He says he thinks he turned the iron off. Clearly, there remains a reasonable possibility that he did not. A suspect against whom the Crown presented a circumstantial evidence case as to his involvement would be entitled to be acquitted. Although the circumstances might not justify an inference that the fire did start accidentally from the iron, those circumstances raised that cause as a reasonable possibility.  
        
       
       
        
        It would, of course be a matter of speculation, whether in fact that rape had been committed by someone else; or the fire had occurred accidentally due to a failure to turn the iron off; but there is no speculation involved in considering whether these are reasonable possibilities.” 
        
       
      
    165 Their Honours were not saying that the jury is entitled to speculate about matters not in evidence. Rather the law is that a jury may infer that an alternative hypothesis consistent with innocence is reasonably possible, even though that hypothesis has not been established as a fact. This inference, however, must be reasonably open on the facts. It cannot be based on mere speculation or conjecture that has no basis in the evidence. As Whealy J noted in R v King [2000] NSWCCA 507 at [65] “…a possibility based on the unknown nature of non-existent evidence would have been quite irrelevant to the strength or weakness of the circumstantial case, and capable of leading to an unfair assessment of the Crown case.” 
     
      
       
      Ground 3 
       
      
    166 In his summing up, Barr J directed the jury that: 
     
      
       
        
        “I do not know whether you accept the submission that the police investigation was inadequate. If you do, your common sense will tell you that, unfortunate though it might be, the result is that you might have less evidence than you might otherwise have had. There is no way of ascertaining whether any further evidence might have emerged if police had made further inquiry and whether, if it had, it might have favoured one side or the other in this case. 
        
       
       
        
        So, to the extent that you think the police ought to have made further inquiries you must not speculate upon what the result of those inquiries might have been. You cannot conclude that a failure to inquire has weakened the Crown case, because to do so you have to start with the proposition that any further inquiry would have made the Crown case stronger. This is something you simply do not know. You are in this simple practical position: However we have got there, this is where we are. This is the evidence. You must judge the case on this evidence. Even if the police have been remiss, you have only this evidence and you must, as I told you right at the beginning of this case, judge this case on the evidence that is put before you, not on this evidence plus some speculative material you might think further inquiries might have produced. You must not do that. You must not speculate. 
        
       
       
        
        If you do conclude that the police investigation was in any way inadequate, it does not weaken the Crown case or strengthen the defence case or vice versa, because you start and finish with the evidence that is available in this case. 
        
       
       
        
        I cannot hope to repeat to you the numerous examples included in Mr Dalton’s closing address and reports recorded in the running sheets and in the discretion of the police officers, not followed up or not followed up very far. You should of course consider whether any of them merited further investigation…”  
        
       
      
    167 Counsel for the accused objected to this part of the summing up. He argued that his Honour should have directed the jury that an absence of evidence regarding any alternative hypotheses could not be “used to advance the Crown case.” His Honour declined to make the direction. The submission at trial is very different to the ground of appeal presently under consideration. The proposition that an absence of evidence does not advance the Crown case is very different to the contention that an inadequate police investigation is capable of weakening the Crown case. 
     
      
    168 The comments of Callinan J (McHugh J, Gummow J, Kirby J and Hayne J agreeing) in Penney v The Queen (1998) 155 ALR 605 are relevant to this ground. At 609-610 his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “It was put that there was, in effect, a trial process which began at the inception of the investigation leading to the bringing of a charge and that a defective police investigation had so infected that trial process that the trial was not a fair trial. 
        
       
       
        
        There is no doubt that the police investigation was unsatisfactory in some respects. However, these defects were fully exposed to the jury in cross-examination and the address to the jury by the appellant’s counsel. There was some reinforcement of the criticism of these defects by the accurate summary of the defence submissions to the jury by the trial judge. 
        
       
       
        
        The appellant’s submissions on these contentions fail at the threshold. They fail because even though a better investigation may, and probably should have, been conducted, there is no general proposition of Australian law that a complete and unexceptionable investigation of an alleged crime is a necessary element of the trial process, or indeed of a fair trial. That is not to give any imprimatur to incomplete, unfair or insufficient investigations. Indeed there may be cases in which deficiencies in the investigation might be of such significance to a particular case as a whole that the accused will be entitled to an acquittal or a retrial. But that will all depend on the facts of the particular case.” 
        
       
      
    169 As Callinan J makes plain an accused may not be able to legitimately complain about the quality of an investigation . Where the evidence against an accused is strong, the fact that it may have resulted from an incomplete investigation may not affect the strength of the Crown case.  
     
      
    170 The appellant submitted that the quality of the police investigation has particular significance in a circumstantial case. It was submitted that when the Crown can only succeed by excluding all reasonable hypotheses consistent with innocence, an inadequate police investigation weakens the Crown case because, without further or proper investigations into any available alternative hypotheses, the Crown cannot exclude them as reasonable possibilities.  
     
      
    171 The argument confuses the role of investigating police and the task of the jury. The question for the jury is whether the whole of the evidence at trial proves to their satisfaction and beyond reasonable doubt that the accused committed the crime. The jury must not speculate as to any matter which a more thorough police investigation might have revealed. Evidence of an inadequate police investigation is not in itself evidence of a reasonable possibility consistent with innocence. Such evidence does not itself weaken the Crown case. This is the essence of what Sully J told the jury in the direction that was the subject of the appeal in R v Galea [2004] NSWCCA 227. This Court did not disapprove of that direction, and for similar reasons I conclude that Barr J made no error by giving the direction that he gave in the instant case. In giving that direction, Barr J correctly and carefully told the jury that they could consider whether any alternative hypotheses “merited further investigation.” The correct approach was stated by Gibbs, Stephen and Mason JJ in Barca v The Queen (1975) 133 CLR 82 at 105: 
     
      
       
        
        “However, although a jury cannot be asked to engage in groundless speculation it is not incumbent on the defence either to establish that some inference other than that of guilt should reasonably be drawn from the evidence or to prove particular facts that would tend to support such an inference. If the jury think that the evidence as a whole is susceptible of a reasonable explanation other than that the accused committed the crime charged the accused is entitled to be acquitted.” 
        
       
      
    172 The appellant submitted that “if a jury is restricted to consider only enquiries that the police considered appropriate then in the absence of an admission by the police that they had made an error, a jury will be confined in effect to the opinions of the police.” The short answer to this is that the jury is asked to consider the evidence.  
     
      
    173 Evidence of any inadequacy in a police investigation may be of greater significance if it has a direct bearing upon the cogency of the evidence that is before the court, such as where the evidence impugns the credibility of police witnesses or reveals that proper procedures were not followed when an eyewitness positively identified a suspect. In the present case it was contended that the police investigation was biased, and that this weakened the Crown case because it made it more likely that the phone call made to Crown Equipment from outside the Empire Hotel on 23 May 1997 was made by a police officer, rather than the appellant. Even if there was substance to the submission, and in my view the evidence does not support it, it does not follow that his Honour erred in his summing up. His Honour was careful to draw a distinction between the adequacy of the police investigation and its propriety. After giving the directions set out above about the relevance of the adequacy or otherwise of the police investigation, his Honour continued: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is for you to decide whether the police investigation stopped short of a proper investigation, whether you think the police closed their minds too early. 
        
       
       
        
        If you do conclude that the police made up their minds too soon, how should you – how can you use your conclusions? 
        
       
       
        
        Well it might lend weight, if you think it has any – if you come to that view then you give it weight and you ask yourselves whether it lends weight to the defence submissions I have already reminded you about, about whether the police gave this case a help along.” 
        
       
      
    174 Earlier his Honour had told the jury that police officers “have been known” to give cases “a little helping hand,” and drew attention to dishonest and illegal conduct by police officers that had been established by the evidence in the instant case. His Honour then said “so the defence points to these things and says, ‘well, it’s not such a fantastic thing, that a police officer might try and give the case a help along,’ and you should not be satisfied that the accused made the telephone call.” 
     
      
    175 In my opinion there was no error in his Honour’s directions on this issue. This ground of appeal fails. 
     
      
       
      Ground 4 
       
      
    176 The Crown conceded that Barr J did not specifically direct the jury that one reasonable hypothesis consistent with innocence based upon the evidence was that Kerry Whelan’s disappearance was effected by a person or persons unknown. However, no such direction was sought at either the first or second trial. Accordingly, leave is required pursuant to r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules.  
     
      
    177 In Domican v The Queen (1991) 173 CLR 555 at 560, Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson, Toohey, Gaudron and McHugh JJ said: 
     
      
       
        
        “A trial judge is not bound to discuss all the evidence or to analyse all the conflicts in the evidence [ 
        R v Ali Ali  
        (1981) 6 A Crim R 161 at 164], and, by itself, the failure of a trial judge to do so does not mean that there has been any miscarriage of justice.” 
        
       
      
    178 In this case Barr J had correctly directed the jury in relation to the law on this issue. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is however, important for you to understand, when you reason from circumstantial evidence to a conclusion that an essential element in the Crown case has been established, or to a conclusion that the accused is guilty of the offence charged, that such inference or conclusion must be one of which you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt.  
        
       
       
        
        If an alternative inference remains reasonably open, the Crown has not made good the element or the guilt of the accused which it wishes to prove by reference to that circumstantial evidence.” 
        
       
      
    179 In these circumstances, it would have been plain to the jury that if they thought that it was reasonably possible that someone other than the named persons who his Honour had mentioned in his summing up was responsible for the offences alleged against the accused, then the Crown had not made out its case.  
     
      
    180 I do not accept the appellant’s submission that the Crown’s failure to make inquiries or adduce evidence directed towards excluding the possibility that an international organisation was responsible for the crime constituted a reversal of the onus of proof. Neither the Crown nor the appellant were required to adduce evidence in relation to this issue. The jury was entitled to find on the evidence available to it that this was not a reasonable alternative hypothesis. 
     
      
    181 Given that the possibility that the offence had been carried out by a person or persons unknown had been given such little attention by the defence, and given that defence counsel did not object to the omission of this scenario in the summing up, I am satisfied that it was not an issue at the trial. I would refuse leave under r 4.  
     
      
       
      Grounds 5 and 6 
       
      
    182 It is convenient to deal with these grounds together. They concern a number of different police “running sheets.” The submissions in some respects were beyond the grounds as stated.  
     
      
    183 I will deal first with the “running sheets” concerning June Parkinson and Maureen Shaw. The appellant submitted that the information contained in these “running sheets” was relevant and admissible. The evidence of June Parkinson was summarised by Barr J as follows (R v Burrell (unreported, NSWSC, 23 March 2006) at [3]): 
     
      
       
        
        “Broadly, the evidence would be of assertions by Mrs Parkinson of events that took place in 1982 or 1983 when she was employed by Bernard Whelan to assist Mrs Kerry Whelan at about the time of the birth of their first child and during which she, Mrs Parkinson, befriends the former wife of Mr Whelan, Mrs Helen Whelan. It appears that Mrs Helen Whelan was ill, alcoholic, and in need of medical treatment and domestic help. She was living in premises other than the premises in which Mr Bernard Whelan and Mrs Kerry Whelan were living. It appears that Mrs Parkinson, having befriended Mrs Helen Whelan, took her side in negotiations that were going on between the former married partners in an effort to reach a family settlement. It fairly appears from the statements that Mrs Parkinson is a very much disaffected former employee of Mr Whelan and ready to make serious criticisms of Mr Whelan, Mrs Kerry Whelan, and others without asserting any or much factual basis for her opinion.” 
        
       
      
    184 Mrs Parkinson also alleged that Kerry Whelan had told her that she was insured by Crown Equipment for one million dollars. The “running sheets” containing the assertions set out above were excluded by the trial judge under s 135 of the Evidence Act (R v Burrell (unreported, NSWSC, 23 March 2006)). An attempt to tender a statement from Mrs Parkinson on the basis that she was unavailable for the purposes of s 65 of the Evidence Act was refused by his Honour because of the appellant’s failure to comply with the notice requirements in s 67 (R v Burrell (unreported, NSWCCA, 11 May 2006). 
     
      
    185 The evidence of Mrs Shaw related to events that happened in Victoria when she was Mr Whelan’s secretary, thirty years before Mrs Whelan’s disappearance. The gist of the evidence was that Mr Whelan had criminal contacts and that he had offered to arrange for one of these contacts to deal violently with Mrs Shaw’s ex-husband. Mrs Shaw said that Mr Whelan’s father had been a policeman and that he was the contact between Mr Whelan and the criminal underworld. Mr Whelan’s father had never in fact been a police officer. Mrs Shaw indicated that she would not give this evidence in court. His Honour was of the view that it would be unfair to the Crown to admit the evidence. 
     
      
    186 The appellant submitted that the “running sheets” were admissible for two reasons: firstly, to show that the police investigation was inadequate because it did not pursue the possibility that Mr Whelan or his criminal contacts had been involved in Mrs Whelan’s disappearance; and, secondly, as proof of the contents of the “running sheets”, which the appellant argues raised a reasonable possibility consistent with the appellant’s innocence.  
     
      
    187 The appellant relied on R v Cakovski (2004) 149 A Crim R 21. In that case the appellant was convicted of murder. At his trial he had raised self-defence, alleging that the deceased had threatened to kill him. The deceased had been convicted of murdering three people in 1978. The appellant was not aware of this at the time. The trial judge refused to admit evidence of the murders because the events in question were too remote in time to have significant probative value (s 135). The trial judge also restricted the cross-examination of Mr Logounov, so that the defence could not seek to elicit the fact that the deceased had referred to the three earlier homicides when a few hours prior to his death he had assaulted and threatened to kill Mr Logounov. The conviction was overturned on appeal. It was held (at 30) that the evidence  
     
      
       
        
        “…had significant probative value, in this way. In the absence of that evidence, the appellant’s evidence that the deceased threatened to kill him in such a way as to make him fearful for his life, and continued to make such threats and to attack him notwithstanding the appellant’s use of a knife, seems on the face of it highly improbable. In my opinion, it becomes less so once one knows that the deceased had committed three murders in the circumstances outlined, albeit as long ago as 1978, and also had made reference to those three murders in uttering a threat to kill Mr Logounov just a few hours before.” 
        
       
      
    188 A majority of the Court were of the view that the evidence was only admissible for this reason. It probably would not have been admissible as tendency evidence (Hodgson JA at 30-31; Hulme J at 35). 
     
      
    189 Barr J distinguished Cakovski on the basis that it was not in dispute that the deceased in that case had been convicted of murder. In dealing with Cakovski in the context of Mrs Parkinson’s evidence, Barr J said (R v Burrell (unreported, NSWSC, 23 March 2006) at [7]-[8]: 
     
      
       
        
        “The facts of that case were different from the present, of course, but Mr Dalton sought to draw comfort from the decision which was to the effect that a trial judge had erred in rejecting evidence of the deceased’s conviction, some 23 years before the events giving rise to the charge, of three counts of murder. In that case, the defence was one of self-defence and the appellant relied, in part, upon an asserted threat by the deceased that he would kill him, the appellant. The fact that the deceased had killed three times before, even though so long ago, was held to be relevant to the probability that the deceased made the threat to kill, asserted and relied upon by the appellant. 
        
       
       
        
        One can understand the importance of the topic, even so old, in a case like that. The case does not assist this accused, however. Although the matter asserted by Mrs Parkinson is not so old – 16 as opposed to 23 years – to admit the evidence now would raise serious problems of proof and testing. The asserted facts could by no means readily be accepted as they were in  
        Cakovski 
        . Sixteen years is still a long time. 
        
       
       
        
        I have not changed my opinion. I think that the probative value of the evidence, if it has any, is slight. I think the potential to prejudice the other side unfairly is great, for the reasons I have given. The objection is upheld. The evidence is excluded.” 
        
       
      
    190 In relation to Mrs Shaw’s evidence, his Honour said in the first trial that it would be unfair to require the Crown to respond to assertions about events that allegedly occurred in Victoria in 1967, and that “even if the topic was able to be raised, any evidence likely to come forward would be, in view of the time which has elapsed, of the most tenuous kind. I think that it would have no probative value.” 
     
      
    191 I agree with Barr J’s assessment of the evidence. It was within his Honour’s discretion to admit or reject it and the appellant has not demonstrated any error in the exercise of that discretion. The evidence was apparently hearsay, was stale and had very little probative value.  
     
      
    192 In my view, it could not have been admitted under s 97 as tendency evidence. In this regard Hulme J’s observation in Cakovski (at 35) that “so removed in time were they [i.e. the murders and the instant offence] that I very much doubt if it would even have been possible to infer from events in 1978 what tendency the deceased may have had in 2001” is apposite. Having regard to the significant danger that the evidence would result in unfair prejudice to the Crown, even if it was admissible as tendency evidence, it ought to have been excluded under s 135. Given the length of time between the events alleged in the running sheets and the offences with which the appellant was charged, the evidence would not have been relevant to the adequacy of the police investigation. The fact that the police had gathered this information at all indicates that their investigations had taken them a considerable distance into Mr Whelan’s past. The fact that they did not pursue the assertions was of no probative value. 
     
      
    193 The only other relevance that the evidence of Mrs Parkinson could have had was to establish that, contrary to Mr Whelan’s evidence, he was in fact aware that Mrs Whelan was insured for one million dollars by Crown Equipment. Given that this evidence was second or third-hand hearsay, and in light of Barr J’s assessment of Mrs Parkinson as “a very much disaffected former employee of Mr Whelan and ready to make serious criticisms of Mr Whelan, Mrs Kerry Whelan, and others without asserting any or much factual basis for her opinion,” his Honour was bound to reject the “running sheet” as proof of the truth of her assertions. 
     
      
    194 The other “running sheets” can be dealt with shortly. In his summing up Barr J said: 
     
      
       
        
        “There was an enormous amount of cross-examination of Detective Superintendent Bray about the police investigation. I cannot begin to detail the various reports recorded in the running sheet that were raised for his consideration. I will give you no more than an example or two. 
        
       
       
        
        A man supposedly ringing from possibly Birrong railway station to say that Mrs Whelan was well; a man saying that he was a Limousine driver who claimed to have picked up a man called Russell Goward, together with Mrs Whelan, to drive them to Strathfield. It is a very long list. These records were made as reports were received from members of the public. There has been some mention of the number of lever arch folders there were, and I have forgotten the number now – 23 or something like that – an enormous number of running sheets. Sometimes the persons making the reports identified themselves; sometimes they did not, either because they did not give their name or gave false particulars. For the most part, Mr Dalton’s questions about these reports have been designed to bring out evidence about how much the police knew from time to time and the way in which they went about their investigation. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        There are two things I must say to you about this evidence. The first is that when you have evidence of a report made from a person who has not given evidence before you in the case, you cannot use that report as possibly proving the truth of the assertion made. Let me take these examples. 
        
       
       
        
        This man who gave a false name and said that he had driven Mr Goward and Mrs Whelan from a florist shop near the Parkroyal Hotel on 6 May and taken them to Strathfield. There is no evidence that any such thing happened. You could not find that such a thing happened. That is not the purpose for which the evidence has been put before you. 
        
       
       
        
        Secondly, the man possibly from Birrong railway station, who refused to name himself, but said that Mrs Whelan was alive and well. That is not evidence that Mrs Whelan was alive and well at the time of the telephone call. You could not make such a finding on that evidence. This and other evidence of its kind has been tendered only to prove the state of police intelligence from time to time so that you can judge the question whether they have already closed their minds, as has been submitted to you. 
        
       
       
        
        The position is different when a report is made by a person who has, since making the report, given evidence before you. So, for example, statements are attributed to, in the various reports, to Mr Bernard Whelan, Mr Karl Bonnette, Mr Trevor Whelan, and there were others too – I think Mrs Woods was one and there are others – people who have come and given evidence before you and have been asked about the things that they reported to the police that were all of course dutifully recorded in running sheets. 
        
       
       
        
        If a witness has given evidence before you and you also have evidence of an earlier statement made out of court by that same witness, whether made in writing or in a formal statement, or recorded in a less formal way, as in a running sheet, you can use that statement as possibly proving the truth of what the witness said on the earlier occasion. But, for the most part, the entries in these running sheets are not reports of people who have given evidence in this case and you cannot use them as possibly proving the truth of what a person is reported to have said.” 
        
       
      
    195 This was an entirely appropriate way to deal with the “running sheets”. The assertions within them, insofar as they were not tested in court, could not have risen above pure speculation in the sense described in Barca and De Gruchy. It was also appropriate for his Honour to limit the cross-examination of police officers in relation to the running sheets in the way that he did. The appellant’s submission that the running sheets were equivalent to the “clear evidence” of the presence of another person or persons outside the “window” in Hulme J’s example in McIntyre cannot be accepted. The assertions contained in the running sheets were not “clear evidence” of the assertions contained within them. Barr J was right to say (R v Burrell (unreported, NSWSC, 3 May 2006) at [6]-[7]): 
     
      
       
        
        “Mr Dalton submits that, contrary to the decision I made at the first trial, I should allow the jury to regard statements of fact recorded in police running sheets as available to prove the truth of that which was reported. Reference was made to the decision of Hulme J in  
        R v McIntyre  
        [2000] NSWCCA 6 at paragraphs 31 and 32. It seems to me that all his Honour was saying in the passage of the judgment which contains those paragraphs was that, in considering whether there was a reasonable hypothesis consistent with the innocence of the appellant, the jury might draw inferences from proved facts. I do not think anything his Honour said touches upon the quality of the statements found in the running sheets likely to be canvassed in the cross-examination of Detective Superintendent Bray. 
        
       
       
        
        I have already given my reasons why those assertions of fact ought not to be available to prove the truth of what was reported. Nothing that has been put to me today has changed my view about that.” 
        
       
      
    196 Grounds 5 and 6 fail. 
     
      
       
      Ground 7: His Honour erred in admitting into evidence: 
       
      (a) the evidence of Peter Sean Buckley; and 
       
      (b) voice “similarity” evidence given by Mrs Pemberton 
       
      
    197 Barr J ruled in relation to the admissibility of the evidence the subject of this ground of appeal during the first trial (R v Burrell (unreported, NSWSC, 21 September 2005)). At the beginning of that judgment his Honour indicated the course he proposed to take, having regard not only to the earlier trial before his Honour and a jury but, also, previous hearings before Sully J and Wood CJ at CL. 
     
      
       
        
        “This is the third time this trial has been listed for hearing. In 2001 it was due to begin before Sully J and in 2003 before Wood CJ at CL. For the most part the evidence I have been asked to consider was considered by their Honours and for the most part the arguments for and against the admission of the evidence were considered by their Honours. Of course, the responsibility of making these decisions as trial Judge had become mine alone, and no decision or opinion of either of their Honours could have bound me. Even so, I have found their Honours’ descriptions of the evidence, their summaries of the arguments and their exposition of the legal principles to be applied of the greatest assistance to me in understanding those matters, as well as in understanding the arguments counsel put before me. 
        
       
       
        
        This trial has already been too long delayed and must proceed with all reasonable speed. This judgment needs to be as concise as possible. Accordingly, I propose to incorporate their Honours’ descriptions and reasons by reference where appropriate, and where I decide to admit or to reject evidence for reasons substantially the same as those already expressed I intend to say so.” 
        
       
       
      Ground 7(a): The evidence of Peter Sean Buckley 
       
      
    198 The Crown summarised the evidence given by Mr Buckley in the second trial in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “(a) Mr Buckley first met the Appellant in late June 1995, while he was working for Ultra Tune, and while the Appellant was working with Peter Grace, whose firm acted as the advertising agent for Ultra Tune. 
        
       
       
        
        (b) The Appellant asked Mr Buckley in late 1996 for a letter advising, untruthfully, that he was on the payroll of Ultra Tune, and was receiving a salary of $80,000 per annum, which he could then use in order to obtain a bank loan, a request with which Mr Buckley did not comply with. 
        
       
       
        
        (c) Following a falling out with Mr Grace in late 1995, Mr Buckley became the subject of some court proceedings in Melbourne, in which Mr Grace was to be a witness on the opposing side. 
        
       
       
        
        (d) In the course of those proceedings, in the first quarter of 1997, the Appellant offered to provide Mr Buckley with an affidavit or statement that would assist his case, but made his signature on it conditional upon payment of a sum of money ($15,000), an offer which Mr Buckley refused on legal advice. 
        
       
       
        
        (e) In the first quarter of 1997 the Appellant asked Mr Buckley a number of times for a sum of $15,000. Mr Buckley was unsure whether he was being asked to give the Appellant the money or to lend it. The Appellant’s requests became increasingly aggressive. The Appellant on one occasion said something like, ‘Get me the fucking money…make it happen…just fucking get it now.’” 
        
       
      
    199 With the exception of some immaterial variations, this evidence is the same as the evidence that the Crown had indicated Mr Buckley would give when Wood CJ at CL ruled upon its admissibility in earlier proceedings (R v Burrell (unreported, NSWSC, 19 December 2003) at [126]). The appellant relied upon the submissions made in those proceedings and in the other proceedings that preceded the present appeal. The effect of those submissions is that since there was already ample evidence of the appellant’s financial motive for committing the alleged crime, the evidence ought to have been excluded under s 137 of the Evidence Act 1995 because it disclosed illegal conduct and bad character generally when the appellant had not raised character at the trial. This argument appears to rely upon the proposition that the availability of other evidence may decrease the probative value of evidence that goes to the same issue.  
     
      
    200 In the proceedings before Wood CJ at CL, his Honour ruled that the evidence was admissible. Relevantly, his Honour said (at [138]-[139] and [141]) that the evidence: 
     
      
       
        
        “…would have a probative value of some significance going to motive. 
        
       
       
        
        As such, I would regard the evidence as admissible, subject to its careful management in a way that would avoid any prejudicial, pejorative, and irrelevant reference by the witness to any unfavourable impression, which he personally formed of Mr Burrell, or to his conclusion that the conduct amounted to an attempt at ‘extortion.’ 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        It is my assessment, consistently with the interpretation given to sections 135 and 137 of the  
        Evidence Act 
        , noted above, that carefully managed, neither section would require its exclusion. The evidence has a significant probative value so far as it is capable of showing that Mr Burrell was desperate for money at the relevant time. Any prejudice that might be occasioned from the circumstance that he was prepared to resort to the use of a false pretence, in order to obtain a loan, or was pressing Mr Buckley for money, can be met by a suitable direction to the jury limiting its use to questions of motive, and cautioning them not to use it by way of tendency reasoning.” 
        
       
      
    201 In R v Burrell [2004] NSWCCA 185, Spigelman CJ (Bell and Hislop JJ agreeing) made the following observations in relation to this evidence: 
     
      
       
        
        “…the evidence of Mr Buckley was the only evidence of motive beyond that referred to in the point marked 3., i.e. Mr Burrell selling assets and borrowing from his father. It is not, however, pertinent, contrary to the Appellant’s submission, that there was other evidence of financial need. In any event, the prosecution is not, within reason, limited to relying on only some of the evidence available to it. 
        
       
       
        
        The evidence of Mr Buckley is reasonably contemporaneous with the alleged kidnapping and does add evidence of significance on the critical issue of motive. His Honour described its probative value as ‘significant.’ He also refused to exclude evidence under either s 135 or s 137, for reasons which appear to me to be correct and, on any view, were open to his Honour.” 
        
       
      
    202 At the first trial, Barr J took the same course as Wood CJ at CL and admitted the evidence (R v Burrell (unreported, NSWSC, 21 September 2005) at [32]). The matter was not reargued in the second trial.  
     
      
    203 In his summing up, Barr J referred to Mr Buckley’s evidence when dealing generally with the topic of the appellant’s financial motive to commit the alleged crime. His Honour referred to evidence from Mr Brown that during the course of a telephone conversation in which the appellant sought to borrow Mr Brown’s car, the appellant had asked whether Mr Brown had a spare $15,000. His Honour noted the appellant’s submission that the real purpose of the phone call was to obtain transport and that the question about the $15,000 was simply a joke, and said: 
     
      
       
        
        “You may need to consider that submission, in the light of another piece of evidence, this time from Mr Peter Buckley. Mr Burrell, he says, made a demand of him for $15,000… 
        
       
       
        
        Mr Buckley’s evidence was that the accused went to him and asked him if he would furnish a letter saying that he, the accused, was employed by Ultra Tune, and he wanted that letter in order to present it to a lending authority to get a loan. Mr Buckley refused. 
        
       
       
        
        The second thing Mr Buckley said was that on a number of occasions the accused asked him to make over the sum of $15,000. I say ‘make over’ because, as I understand Mr Buckley’s evidence, it was never clear to him whether the accused was asking for a gift or a loan but, at any rate, you heard his evidence and you will form your own views about that. I simply point out that the $15,000 is the same as the amount the accused asked Mr Brown for.” 
        
       
      
    204 The rest of the summing up that touched upon Mr Buckley’s evidence simply noted inconsistencies within his testimony that had been pointed out by the appellant. The appellant took an objection with respect to this aspect of the summing up, which his Honour corrected. No other objection was made in relation to the way Mr Buckley’s evidence was dealt with by his Honour. 
     
      
    205 In his submissions on this appeal, the appellant did not criticise his Honour’s summing up. The appellant was content to merely reiterate the submission made in the earlier proceedings that the probative value of the evidence was outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, and so it ought to have been excluded under s 137.  
     
      
    206 I do not accept this submission. The evidence was of probative value in relation to the matter of motive. The availability of other evidence of financial hardship did not in any way reduce that value. I accept that the conduct of the appellant disclosed by the evidence was not favourable to him and suggested an intemperate personality. Although not evidence of the commission of a crime, a criminal act was contemplated. However, it was plainly evidence which was probative of the appellant’s urgent desire to obtain funds. This case is quite different to a case such as R v Cook [2004] NSWCCA 52, where this Court held that evidence of flight ought to have been excluded under s 137 because the only response the appellant could have made to the evidence was to admit to prior convictions that had “a disturbingly close relationship to the offence with which he was charged” ([48]). The danger of prejudice arose from the potential for the jury to use the evidence as adverse to the appellant’s character or as tendency evidence. Although the trial judge did not specifically direct the jury that the evidence was not to be used for such a purpose, his Honour’s discussion of Mr Buckley’s evidence in the summing up was entirely confined to the context of motive, to which the evidence was highly relevant. In these circumstances there was no real danger that the jury would use the evidence in an impermissible and unfair way. If there had been, trial counsel would undoubtedly have brought the judge’s attention to this possibility. Apart from counsel accepting that there was no need for any further direction, if he had done so, the effect would have been to emphasise the significance of the evidence elevating its importance in the mind of the jury. There were sound forensic reasons to be satisfied that, confined to matters of motive, the directions given were appropriate. 
     
      
    207 I reject this ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      Ground 7(b): The voice ‘similarity’ evidence given by Mrs Pemberton 
       
      
    208 This ground of appeal relates to the telephone call made to Crown Equipment on 23 May 1997. It was not disputed that whoever made that call must have had knowledge of the terms of the ransom note. The gist of the contested evidence is recorded in the judgment of Sully J (R v Burrell (unreported, NSWSC, 5 March 2001) at [71]-[74]): 
     
      
       
        
        “What is in issue for present purposes is the admissibility of evidence proposed to be led from Mrs Pemberton, the receptionist who took the call, concerning the voice of the caller. 
        
       
       
        
        The relevant facts in that connection, put simply, are that at the end of December 1997 the investigating police transferred onto an audio tape the previously recorded voice of the accused answering a question during the course of a recorded interview by police with him on 15 June 1997. The police also recorded the voices of six police officers reading the same words as those spoken by the accused. All seven recordings were then played to Mrs Pemberton. 
        
       
       
        
        Mrs Pemberton’s reaction to the tapes is described as follows by her in a statement that she gave subsequently to the police: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘The audio tapes marked “C” and “D” were the closest to the voice that I had the telephone conversation with at Crown on Friday 23 May 1997. I believe that the caller on 23 May 1997 had a huskier voice. His voice also sounded like he was well educated. On a scale of ten I would say that the voice [sic] on tape “C” and “D” scored a six.’ 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        The voice on tape ‘D’ is that of the accused. The voice on tape ‘C’ is that of a particular police officer; and it is now agreed that he was not in Goulburn on 23 May 1997.” 
        
       
      
    209 The Crown did not rely on this evidence as evidence of positive identification. The evidence was led merely as circumstantial evidence which, at its highest, was capable of establishing that the voice of the caller was similar to the appellant’s voice. Sully J held that the evidence was admissible on this basis, stating (at [76]) that “I consider that the giving at trial of proper directions will be sufficient to ensure that the jury will not give this evidence more than its true weight.” At [32] in his judgment of 21 September 2005, Barr J said in relation to this evidence: “This material is dealt with at paras 70-77 of the judgment of Sully J of 6 [sic – 5] March 2001. I agreed with his Honour’s reasoning and conclusion and decided to admit the evidence.” 
     
      
    210 The appellant relied on his submissions in earlier proceedings in relation to this ground of appeal. The appellant submitted that it was important that Mrs Pemberton did not say that the voices were “similar.” The argument, as I understand it, was that the fact that Mrs Pemberton had described the appellant’s voice as “close to,” rather than “similar” to, the voice of the caller gave rise to a significant danger that the jury would understand this as a positive identification rather than as evidence of similarity. It was submitted that since the evidence was of such low probative value in any event, it should have been excluded pursuant to s 137. 
     
      
    211 If there was a danger that the jury would use the evidence as positive identification evidence, then there was a danger that the jury would use the evidence in an unfairly prejudicial way. This much is clear from R v Pitkin (1995) 80 A Crim R 302, where the High Court quashed the accused’s convictions on the basis that evidence that the accused “looked like” the person who in fact committed the crime was not capable of positively identifying the accused as the offender. However, as Sully J noted in his judgment of 5 March 2001, in the present case any prejudice could have been remedied by appropriate directions. In my view Barr J’s directions on this issue were entirely appropriate. At 308-309 in the summing up his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “There was evidence in relation to the telephone call from the Empire Hotel phone box from Mrs Pemberton of Crown Equipment. You remember that she listened to seven audio tapes. One of them was undoubtedly a tape of the accused’s voice; it was taken from one of the answers that you see in one of the interviews. Six other tapes were made by police officers. You will remember Mrs Pemberton told you that she was asked to pick out the voice, if she heard it. I do not remember precisely now what she was asked, but her response was to say, to pick out two voices as the closest and to rate them as equal at 6 on a scale of 10, and that must have been a scale of likeness. I do not want you to be misled by this evidence. I directed you before on the evidence of Mrs Lambert and Mrs Woods and I told you that that was identification evidence and I gave you a special warning about it. I want you to understand that the evidence of Miss [sic] Pemberton is not identification evidence. She does not say ‘that was the accused who was the man who was speaking to me.’ She does not say ‘the voice on that tape is the voice that spoke to me in the telephone call.’ The Crown does not put it that high. It is not identification evidence.” 
        
       
      
    212 Earlier in their addresses, both the Crown and counsel for the appellant had referred to the evidence as evidence of similarity. In Gibson (1999) 110 A Crim R 180 the victim had given evidence of hearing someone say “I’m going to kill you.” Initially the victim had said that the voice sounded like the accused’s voice, but in cross-examination he said that he was unsure. The accused was convicted of robbery with violence. At 187, Adams J (Spigelman CJ and Studdert J agreeing) said:  
     
      
       
        
        “To my mind this question was in substance left to the jury as a matter to which they would give only a little, if any, weight in their considerations. It was clearly not evidence of identification of the appellant and no suggestion was made by the learned trial judge that it was capable of being so used. In my view, this suffices to distinguish this case from  
        Pitkin 
        …” 
        
       
      
    213 In the present case, not only was there no suggestion that the evidence could be used as evidence of positive identification, but the trial judge carefully directed the jury that it could not be so used. If the evidence ever gave rise to any danger of unfair prejudice, it was cured by these directions. 
     
      
    214 I do not attach any significance to the fact that Mrs Pemberton described the accused’s voice as “closest” (counsel submitted “close to”) rather than “similar to” the voice of the caller. To the extent that the words “closest” or “close to” are capable of indicating a positive identification rather than a similarity, this possibility was entirely negated by Mrs Pemberton’s evidence that the caller’s voice had been huskier than the accused’s voice and that the likeness between the two voices was only six out of ten. The suggestion that the evidence would have been understood by the jury as a positive identification was made even more unlikely by the fact that at the time of the “identification” Mrs Pemberton had selected the voice of a police officer as being equally comparable to the voice of the caller. 
     
      
    215 It is clear that the evidence was of only slight probative value. So much was recognised by the Crown in its submissions. However, given that any danger of unfair prejudice could be (and was) removed by appropriate directions, there was no reason to exclude it. It has been said more than once in this Court that in applying s 137 of the Evidence Act, a trial judge can and should consider any warnings or directions he or she may give to ensure that unfair prejudice does not arise (see eg R v Em [2003] NSWCCA 374 at [121]). That is precisely what occurred in this case.  
     
      
    216 This ground of appeal fails. 
     
      
       
      Ground 8: His Honour erred in permitting further cross-examination by the Crown, pursuant to s 38 of the  
      Evidence Act 
      , after cross-examination by the defence had concluded, of Norman Elliott, Frances Carter and Alan Burrell. 
       
      
    217 This ground relates to his Honour’s decision to grant leave to the Crown pursuant to s 38 of the Evidence Act to cross-examine three witnesses, which it called: Norman Elliott, Frances Carter and Alan Burrell. Each witness gave evidence when cross-examined by the defence which was unfavourable to the Crown case. 
     
      
       
      Norman Elliott 
       
      
    218 Mr Elliott was one of the witnesses who gave allegedly “false sighting” evidence, as I have described elsewhere in my summary of the Crown case. When examined in chief, Mr Elliott said that on the morning of 6 May 1997 he entered the Parkroyal Hotel via the main revolving door entrance in the front lobby to use the toilets close by. He said that as he walked across the frontage of the hotel towards the main revolving door entrance, he looked towards the right and saw a lady, who he thought was Mrs Whelan, and a man coming out of the carpark ramp. Mr Elliott recalled that as the man walked out of the carpark ramp he saw him move from the right to the left in front of the lady. He said that the man was a white Caucasian. 
     
      
    219 The Crown referred to the previous trial of the appellant in 2005 when Mr Elliott had also given evidence. On that occasion the Crown also called Mr Shah, who it could positively be established was the man who exited the carpark at the same time as Mrs Whelan. He was of “Indian-type” origin. Although it was apparent that Mr Shah did not match the description of the man Mr Elliott remembered seeing, he maintained that his recollection of seeing the man, who exited the carpark ramp with Mrs Whelan, was correct. Later in his evidence in chief, the Crown played to him a video with footage from the hotel security cameras. The footage of the front lobby did not show Mr Elliott entering the hotel at the time he said he did. Nor was there any sign of him in the footage of the corridor outside the toilet at the time he said he went to the toilet. The footage also showed that the man Mr Elliott saw coming out of the carpark ramp was not in front of Mrs Whelan, as he said he was, but was behind her. These matters suggested that Mr Elliott may not have seen Mrs Whelan or Mr Shah walking out of the hotel carpark ramp on the morning of 6 May 1997. 
     
      
    220 When cross-examined by the defence, Mr Elliott agreed that it was possible that he could have entered the hotel via the entrance east of the main revolving door entrance in the front lobby. This may explain why he was not seen on the security camera footage of the front lobby. He also accepted that his recollection of Mr Shah’s position relative to Mrs Whelan as they both exited the carpark ramp and his recollection of Mr Shah’s build and complexion were not correct. 
     
      
    221 In light of this evidence, the trial judge granted leave to the Crown, under s 38, to cross-examine Mr Elliott after he had been cross-examined by the defence in relation to his movements that morning and his concession that his recollection in relation to Mr Shah was not correct. 
     
      
       
      Frances Carter 
       
      
    222 Mrs Carter was another witness who gave allegedly “false sighting” evidence. 
     
      
    223 During her evidence in chief, Mrs Carter confirmed her first written statement of 3 June 1997 to the police where she said that the woman she saw on 6 May 1997 was “possibly” Mrs Whelan. When cross-examined by the defence, she stated that the woman was “definitely” Mrs Whelan. The Crown was granted leave to cross-examine her about this evidence. 
     
      
       
      Alan Burrell 
       
      
    224 Mr Alan Burrell is the appellant’s father. He gave important evidence in relation to the appellant’s movements in April 1997. 
     
      
    225 During his evidence in chief, Mr Burrell initially said that the appellant had stayed over at his home for 3 days and 2 nights. He said that the appellant arrived at his place on Tuesday 15 April 1997, stayed Tuesday night and Wednesday night and left on the Thursday. He said that he believed that the appellant was going to see Mr Whelan on the Wednesday, which, he agreed, was the second day of the appellant’s stay with him. 
     
      
    226 Later in his evidence in chief, the Crown took Mr Burrell to portions of the transcript of a conversation between Mr Burrell and his two daughters, Deborah and Tonya, on 11 July 1997, which the police had covertly recorded. Mr Burrell agreed that in that conversation, he said the 3 days of the appellant’s stay were Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday. He also agreed that he said to his daughters that on the Wednesday morning, being the third day, the appellant said, as he left Mr Burrell’s home, that he was going to the Whelan residence to see Mr Whelan about picking up some freelance advertising work. The Crown also took Mr Burrell to the transcript of an intercepted telephone conversation with his daughter, Tonya, on 19 June 1997. In that conversation he said that the appellant left his place on the third day and was going to see the Whelans to pick up some work. 
     
      
    227 When cross-examined, Mr Burrell agreed with a suggestion put to him that he was correct about Wednesday being the day the appellant visited the Whelans’ residence but was mistaken about it being the third day. 
     
      
    228 With leave of the court under s 38, the Crown was allowed to cross-examine Mr Burrell. The prosecutor emphasised that Mr Burrell had signed a statement on 19 June 1997, in which he indicated that the appellant had stayed at his home on Monday night and Tuesday night and visited the Whelans on the Wednesday, being the third day. 
     
      
    229 The Crown case proceeded on the basis that Mr Burrell’s evidence that the appellant was going to see Mr Whelan on the Wednesday was mistaken, but was correct about it being the third day. The defence, however, submited that Mr Burrell was correct about the Wednesday but mistaken about it being the third day of the appellant’s stay. 
     
      
    230 The Crown version of events suggests the appellant falsely told his father of his intention to travel to Kurrajong on Thursday, having already gone the day before and failed in his attempt to kidnap Mrs Whelan. It refutes the defence submission that the appellant could not have been intending to kidnap Mrs Whelan on Wednesday 16 April 1997 because in telling his father on the Wednesday morning that he was going to see Mr Whelan, he did so before he went, consistently with the defence version of events. 
     
      
    231 In relation to cross-examination of each of these witnesses by the Crown, the appellant submitted that the Crown was given an opportunity to unfairly undermine the credibility of each witness and dilute the effect of evidence given during their cross-examination by the defence that was unfavourable to the Crown. The appellant emphasised that the Crown was on notice as to the evidence which the witnesses would give having regard to the evidence which they gave at the first trial in 2005. 
     
      
       
      Discussion 
       
      
    232 Section 38 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) was introduced to facilitate a party in testing the evidence of a witness called in that party’s case. The rationale for liberalisation of the traditional rules was to ensure that all relevant evidence was placed before the tribunal of fact: (see ALRC Report No 26, Evidence (Interim), 1986 at [625]). 
     
      
    233 When a party calls a witness the usual expectation is that the witness’s evidence will assist that party’s case. For this reason, evidence given by such a witness which is unfavourable to the party calling him or her, may be seen as an indication of the honesty of the witness in the same way that an admission against a party’s own interests will often be seen to be more believable than a statement that serves that party’s interests. There were difficulties under the common law in having a witness declared hostile, a necessary step before the calling party could cross-examine: (see McLellan v Bowyer (1961) 106 CLR 95 at 102-104; R v Hadlow [1992] 2 Qd R 440 at 442-443, 448-450; ALRC Report No 26, Evidence (Interim), 1986 at [294]-[297], [623]). As a consequence, on occasions, because of the forensic risks a material witness would not be called by either side. Section 38 was intended to ameliorate the common law and make it easier for a party to test the evidence of their own witness.  
     
      
    234 Smart AJ described the operation of the section in R v Kneebone (1999) 47 NSWLR 450 at 471: 
     
      
       
        
        “Section 38 of the  
        Evidence Act 1995 
         then needs to be considered as it allows a party, who called witness [sic], with the leave of the Court, to question a witness as though cross-examining her about evidence given that is unfavourable to the party. Under s 38(4) such questioning is to take place before the other parties cross-examine the witness unless the Court otherwise directs. Section 38 makes an important change in the law and removes restrictions which had the effect, on occasions, of making important evidence unavailable and preventing the adequate testing of evidence. The judge has the task of deciding whether the evidence is unfavourable (not favourable) and then whether in the exercise of his discretion he ought to grant leave to cross-examine. The careful exercise of that discretion is designed to ensure that there will be no unfairness.” 
        
       
      
    235 In the application of s 38 the courts have been careful to emphasise that the flexibility which the section provides should be implemented in a manner which ensures that the trial remains fair. In R v Fowler [2000] NSWCCA 142 at [120], Wood CJ at CL said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Section 38 of the  
        Evidence Act 
         now permits a party, by leave, to cross-examine a witness who meets any of the criteria identified in sub-section (1). Its exercise is, however, subject to a number of discretionary considerations, so as to prevent its abuse, and is a section that needs to be applied with some care in criminal trials. So it is that before leave is granted, the trial judge must give consideration to the matters specified in s 38(6), s 135 to s 137, and s 192 of the Act.” 
        
       
      
    236 As I emphasise below one of the more significant consequences of s 38 is that a court may allow a party who calls an unfavourable witness to cross-examine that witness after the witness has been cross-examined by the opposing lawyer. Accordingly, a witness may be cross-examined by the calling party about unfavourable evidence that emerges in the course of regular cross-examination. Of course, as Wood CJ at CL emphasised, the discretion to allow this to occur may only be exercised after taking account of the matters specified in s 38(6) s 135 to s 137 and s 192. 
     
      
    237 In most situations if a party is given leave to cross-examine their own witness, the cross-examination should occur before any other party cross-examines (s 38(4)). However, in R v Parkes (2003) 147 A Crim R 450 at 462, Ipp JA noted that there is ample authority to support the proposition that s 38 allows an unfavourable witness to be questioned on evidence led in ordinary cross-examination. His Honour cited R v Milat (unreported, NSWSC, 23 April 1996), R v Pantoja (unreported, NSWCCA, 5 November 1998) and R v Mansour (unreported, NSWSC, 19 November 1996). In Milat, Hunt CJ at CL said (at 6-7): 
     
      
       
        
        “As the unfavourable evidence was not given until the witnesses were cross-examined by the accused, the Crown could not cross-examine them about the unfavourable evidence until that cross-examination by the accused had taken place. In those circumstances, the situation was to be very different to that where the Crown has led evidence from the witness which is favourable to its case but has then also obtained evidence upon some other issue which was unfavourable. The Law Reform Commission expressed different views at different times concerning the stage at which the party calling such a witness should be entitled to cross-examine upon the unfavourable evidence in that different situation. Originally, it proposed that it should be after the other party or parties had had the opportunity to cross-examine the witness. In its Final Report, the Commission said that this should not be an inflexible requirement, and that provision should be made to enable the other party or parties to question the witness further after the cross-examination by the party who called the witness. Although perhaps not readily apparent from its terms, this appears to have been the intention behind subss (4) and (5) of s 38. 
        
       
       
        
        In order to reflect the intention (or to comply with the spirit) of the section, therefore, I held that, in the event that these witnesses called at the request of the accused gave the unfavourable evidence as expected, it would be appropriate to grant leave to the Crown pursuant to subs (1) to cross-examine them in relation to that evidence, and to do so after they had been cross-examined by the accused. I also said that the accused would then be permitted to cross-examine the witness further after the Crown had conducted its cross-examination, such cross-examination to be unlimited in nature and not restricted as if it were a re-examination, with the Crown having the right finally to re-examine the witness.” 
        
       
      
    238 One of the reasons why the common law regarding hostile witnesses was so strict was the assumption that a party who calls a witness is vouching for their honesty. This assumption plays no part in the statutory approach which allows a party to cross-examine their own witness, even when the unfavourable evidence is not unexpected. In its Interim Report of 1985 (Report No 26), the ALRC (at [626]) rejected the idea that the new rule should only apply where the unfavourable evidence came as a surprise to the calling party: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is argued that where a party knows that a witness will not swear up to his proof of evidence, but calls such a witness intending to attack his evidence, it is a misuse of evidence – the witness is not being put forward as a witness of truth. Thus this argument is based on the ‘vouching the witness’ theory which has been discredited. As to the prosecution, it is argued that it will receive a tactical advantage because, where a prior statement is used, it will go into evidence as an exhibit and go to the jury room. The prosecution, however, has suffered the tactical disadvantage of having to call a witness to prove its case and that witness has supported the defence. The argument also wrongly assumes that the defence will never have the need to call an unfavourable witness. A grave danger in imposing the requirement that the unfavourable evidence is unexpected is that it would enable criminals to defeat prosecutions by suborning key witnesses. The prosecution will normally find out before the hearing, particularly where there is a committal, that a witness is unfavourable.” 
        
       
      
    239 That, of course, is not to say that the fact that the prosecution is aware when they call a witness that the witness is likely to give unfavourable evidence is not a relevant consideration when exercising the discretion to grant leave or to make a direction. 
     
      
    240 In R v Parkes at 462 Ipp JA noted that “judges have disapproved of the use of s 38 as a tactical or forensic device.” This is particularly so when a party seeks leave to cross-examine an unfavourable witness after the witness has undergone ordinary cross-examination. In R v Kingswell (unreported, NSWCCA, 2 September 1998) Studdert J held that the trial judge had erred (but not sufficiently to have caused a miscarriage of justice) by granting leave under s 38 after ordinary cross-examination. His Honour was of the view that in circumstances where the Crown anticipated the unfavourable evidence the matter should have been dealt with before the other parties cross-examined the witness (see pp. 16-17). Smart J expressly disagreed with Studdert J and placed significance on the fact that, in order to overcome any prejudice that might have been caused, the trial judge had given opposing counsel the opportunity to further cross-examine the witness following the Crown’s s 38 cross-examination. This was the same procedure adopted by Hunt CJ at CL in R v Milat. There have been other cases where judges have disapproved of the use of s 38 as a tactical weapon.

      JUDGMENT  
      (on application for variation of bail: see PT987)  
       
       
      
    1 JOHNSON J: On 2 March 2007, I acceded to an application on behalf of the Accused to adjourn the commencement of his trial from 5 March 2007 to 19 March 2007. The reasons for that conclusion are contained in my judgment, R v Petroulias (No. 11).  
     
      
    2 Today, I have been provided with a further affidavit of Edmond William Coady sworn 8 March 2007 which annexes a number of documents.  
     
      
    3 In short, application for summary judgment is to be made in the Supreme Court of Queensland on Wednesday, 14 March 2007, by the Plaintiff, Prepaid Professional Administration Limited (“Prepaid”). Prepaid will seek judgment in the amount of $785,000.00 or such lesser sum, being no less than the difference between $250,000.00 and $785,000.00. Senior and junior counsel will act for Prepaid on that application.  
     
      
    4 Prepaid will need to make out the test in cl.292 Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 1999 (Qld) and satisfy the Court that the Defendant has no real prospect of successfully defending all or part of Prepaid’s claim, and that there is no need for a trial of the claim or part of the claim.  
     
      
    5 The affidavits which have been served by Prepaid for the purpose of that application include an affidavit sworn by the present Accused on 8 March 2007, and affidavits of Amanda Jane Chisnall and Denise Ann Clark, which I understand were sworn yesterday. In addition, there is a further affidavit of Mr Coady to be relied upon in the Queensland proceedings, on the application for summary judgment.  
     
      
    6 Clause 296 Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 1999 (Qld) provides for service of affidavits by the Plaintiff and Defendant at nominated times prior to the hearing of a summary judgement application. Prepaid seeks abridgement of times required under the rules for procedural steps for the purpose of the application being heard next week.  
     
      
    7 I am informed that there has been no response, as yet, from the Defendant, Home Wilkinson Lowry. Clearly, no affidavit has been served by that Defendant nor, it would seem, has any indication been given as yet by the Defendant that application will be made for leave to cross examine any of the deponents of Prepaid’s affidavits on the application, in accordance with cl.295 of the Rules.  
     
      
    8 With respect to the adjournment application that was made last week, and which is being mentioned again today for the purpose of informing the Court of the status of the application in Queensland, Mr Walsh, counsel for the Accused, submits that the appropriate course is to stand the matter over until 2 pm on Thursday, 15 March 2007 so that the Court can be informed of what has transpired in the Supreme Court of Queensland the previous day. That is an appropriate course and I will shortly make that order.  
     
      
    9 I have mentioned, in some detail, the deponents who have sworn affidavits in support of the summary judgment application because it bears upon the second application which is made today. On Tuesday of this week, urgent application was made to vary the Accused's bail conditions to allow him to travel to New Zealand. It was submitted that there were three purposes which he sought to achieve in New Zealand.  
     
      
    10 The first was to make arrangements for alternative funding, in the event that the proceedings in the Supreme Court of Queensland do not result in the expected outcome. For that purpose, it was submitted that it was necessary for the Accused to have face-to-face meetings with persons in New Zealand.  
     
      
    11 The second purpose was to give the Accused an opportunity to obtain access to documents and material contained in a computer held in the Registry of the High Court of New Zealand, pending the resolution of a claim for privilege with respect to those items, which apparently were seized pursuant to the exercise of statutory powers in New Zealand.  
     
      
    12 The third basis for the application was to allow the Accused an opportunity to visit what is, in effect, his home in New Zealand where, I am informed, he resides with Ms Clark, who is his partner.  
     
      
    13 I indicated to Mr Walsh on Tuesday that evidence would be required to support the application, and the application was stood over until today.  
     
      
    14 No further evidence has been placed before the Court today on the bail variation application. It is a present condition of the Accused’s bail that he surrender his passport to the Supreme Court of New South Wales and that, other than pursuant to his conditions of bail, that he not approach international points of departure nor apply for any passport.  
     
      
    15 Bail Condition (b)(i) provides that, during the remand period, the Accused's passport is to be returned to him for the purpose of travel overseas, upon him providing to the Australian Federal Police (for the attention of Federal Agent Stephen Dametto) a copy of the Accused's travel itinerary, not less than seven days prior to departure or such lesser period as agreed with Federal Agent Dametto. The current condition, effectively, permits the Accused to travel on the provision of an itinerary not less than seven days prior to departure, or such lesser period as agreed with the relevant Federal Agent.  
     
      
    16 Today, the application to allow the Accused to travel to New Zealand is based upon the third ground only, namely, an opportunity to visit Ms Clark in New Zealand and for associated personal purposes which may involve meetings with other persons. No evidence has been placed before me on this ground. The first two grounds which were relied upon on Tuesday are no longer pressed.  
     
      
    17 No itinerary has been presented to Federal Agent Dametto indicating what is currently proposed by way of travel to New Zealand. However, I am asked to proceed on the basis that, if such an itinerary was provided to Federal Agent Dametto now, he would decline to agree with the lesser period proposed.  
     
      
    18 Accordingly, the application that is currently before the Court is essentially one to allow the Accused to travel to New Zealand in the near future. What is proposed is that he be allowed to travel to New Zealand later today and to return on Tuesday of next week. Initially, the application was that, unless he is required for cross examination in the Supreme Court of Queensland next Wednesday, he be allowed to return on Thursday of next week.  
     
      
    19 I have raised with Mr Walsh a number of issues concerning the significance of the Queensland proceedings to the Accused. It seems to me that prudent legal representatives, acting for Prepaid on the summary judgment application, would ensure that all deponents were at Court on Wednesday as against the possibility that there may be a late application to cross examine any of them, given that the Rules are not currently being complied with in respect of service of affidavits. 
     
      
    20 Further, I have been told that the Provisional Liquidator of Prescience Communications Limited (”Prescience”), a company to which reference is made in my judgment of 2 March 2007, has indicated orally that Prescience has no interest in asserting a claim on the funds which are the subject of the Prepaid application next Wednesday, but has asserted in writing, an intention to make a claim on the funds. The position seems, to say the least, somewhat fluid in that respect.  
     
      
    21 I would have thought that the primary focus of the Accused's attention, between now and next Wednesday, ought be on dealing with issues (both expected and unexpected) that may arise in advance of the Prepaid application, so that the risk of any adjournment of that application is minimised. It is not, of course, for me to give advice to the Accused or to Ms Clark as to how they conduct their affairs. However, it will be apparent from what I said on 2 March 2007 and again today, that this Court, the community, the Crown, and the Accused, have a substantial interest in the early resolution of the Queensland proceedings, to the extent that they have provided a justification for the adjournment of a criminal trial before this Court.  
     
      
    22 For my part, I would have thought that the Accused and Ms Clark would be available in Australia between now and next Wednesday and, in particular, on Monday and Tuesday, to allow any issues raised either by Home Wilkinson Lowry or the Provisional Liquidator of Prescience to be confronted and dealt with by way of instructions and, if need be, evidence. My concern is that if the Accused is in New Zealand for a number of days, even if Ms Clark is there as well, that state of affairs may itself compound and complicate what is already a delayed trial. The adjournment of the trial occurred following a late application. It would be clear that the Court is very concerned to ensure that this trial proceeds. 
     
      
    23 Although the Accused may desire to visit New Zealand and visit Ms Clark (assuming she remains there for the entire period between now and next Tuesday) or other persons, it seems to me that, given the state that has been reached with respect to the Queensland litigation, which is inextricably linked to the commencement of a serious criminal trial in this Court, that the giving of permission for the Accused to travel to New Zealand for several days (for social and personal purposes) is not a step which I will take.  
     
      
    24 To the extent that there is an application to vary the existing bail conditions for that purpose, I decline to vary the bail conditions. I am not satisfied, on the material that has been put before me, that such a variation would be in the interests of the orderly and expeditious commencement of this trial. The application is refused.

    JUDGMENT1 Nareg Mouradian, hereinafter the appellant, had been employed with DJ’s Pty Limited as a loss prevention officer for six and a half years. For those years he had been a model employee, taking an active part in the enhancing of store security at Bondi Junction. 2 In mid-2004 work-related stress symptoms began to manifest as anxiety and panic attacks. He was assessed as unfit to work on 9 June 2004 to 24 June 2004. On 24 June 2004 he was assessed as fit to work. The period covered by Workcover New South Wales medical certificate was 24/6/04 to 28/8/04. The certificate spoke of him working as usual, subject to avoiding meetings and stressful situations, to have breaks. It was recommended he monitor security cameras, see exhibit twelve. 3 On the night of Tuesday 27 July 2004 at Bondi, four different cash registers were damaged. Two thousand five hundred and ninety-eight dollars was stolen and a roof-mounted pan tilt security camera valued at $3,000 was also stolen. The appellant was charged with maliciously damaging the cash registers, breaking out from the DJ’s store and stealing the camera.4 After a prolonged hearing in the Local Court, Magistrate G E Brad convicted him of all five offences. He has appealed against his convictions and sentence.5 The Court’s task is to rehear this matter upon the basis of the transcripts of evidence and exhibits tendered in the Local Court, and such evidence as is received in this court by leave.6 The Court’s powers in determining the appeal enable it to set aside a conviction or dismiss the appeal. I remind myself the prosecution must prove each of the essential elements of each offence beyond a reasonable doubt.7 The essential elements of each malicious damage charge requires the crown to prove beyond reasonable doubt that on 27 July 2004 the appellant maliciously damaged the relevant cash register. The essential element of the other count are that the appellant committed larceny whilst in the DJ’s building and then broke out of the DJ’s building. The crown and defence cases.8 The crown case is that the appellant remained behind after work on 27 July 2004, and while in the store, the appellant damaged four cash registers by prising them open, captured the cash float in the registers. The crown case was that the accused was in each area where cash register damage had occurred.9 The crown case was that prior to prising open one cash register in the men’s suit counter, the camera tasked with surveilling that area was removed from its housing and stolen. Subsequently, if I understand the evidence correctly, the cash register in the men’s suit department became one of the four cash registers damaged and emptied of cash.10 The defence case is that the appellant left as was normal on the twenty-seventh. He had drunk vodka on top of prescribed medication. He returned to the store to find a toilet. As a result of interaction between alcohol and medication he became dazed and confused. He fell asleep in the toilet and woke confused. In his confusion he wandered about level three and four of the building. There were a number of other personnel in the building, including cleaners, electricians and classic contractors - although I do not understand what they do - and night security.11 The appellant’s case is he was not guilty of any damage to the cash registers, nor did he steal any money or the CCTV camera. It was conceded the appellant left via a fire escape exit. The cases against him are circumstantial.Facts. 12 A number of matters were not in dispute. Evidence establishing these facts was not challenged and I rely upon it to a point where I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of. 
     
     There were more than four damaged cash registers. The circumstances in which they were damaged was only consistent with that damage being maliciously inflicted. 
     In excess of $2,590 that had been used as, what I understand to be, cash floats went missing between close of work on 27 July and 9.30am on the following morning in circumstances where its disappearance could only have been consistent with larceny.  
     The CCTV camera located near the men’s suit section was screwed from its fitting and thereafter missing in circumstances consistent only with it being taken during its operation by someone whose intent was to permanently deprive DJ’s of that camera. 
     That at the same point, before 11pm, the appellant left DJ’s by opening a fire door to the fire escape staircase and descended the stairs to the street. 
     The real issues in the trial are whether the person or persons who damaged the cash registers was one and the same person. 
     That the person who damaged the cash register in the men’s suit section was the same person who moments before, or at least some time before, disconnected the camera. 
     That the person who disconnected the camera was also the same person who stole the camera, thus whether the person who damaged the cash registers, stole the money, the cash tills and stole the camera was one and the same person. 
    13 The real issue before the Local Court and on appeal before me is whether the prosecution has proved beyond reasonable doubt the appellant was that person, if there be only one.The case against the appellant. 14 The appellant did not return to work on the 28th. He claims to have worked the Monday the 25th for a shift swap. That shift swap was not shown in the time sheets as would normally be the situation. On Thursday he called in sick. Friday, Saturday and Sunday were his rostered days off.15 On 2 August the appellant was interviewed by DJ’s risk manager. She alleged, “On each of these levels where you are clearly identified there was damage reported to cash registers”. He was then asked, “Can you tell me anything about the damage to these registers?” His reply was “I was in a daze, I don’t know”. 16 When asked which toilets he was in he again replied, “I don’t know, I was in a dazed state”. When asked whether he had a reason to be in all of the following areas - Sportscraft, Table Eight, George Gross, men’s accessories, men’s shoes and men’s suits - he answered, “I was in a dazed state. As far as I was concerned I wanted to get out”.17 In the course of his evidence he professed a memory of his actions; “I tried to stick to the main aisles” - transcript 9/3/06, p 13. “I opened the fire door to look and see what came in or out” (I think that also may be on the same page). Significantly, the appellant recalls the doors closing behind him and locking him in the stair well and his descending to the street.18 When asked why he had not attended work since the twenty-seventh by the risk manager in the interview, he answered, “I am pretty sick of working there. I vomit just before I walk in, I go to church before I walk in, I am pretty much sick of it”. When asked, “Is that the only reason that you have not attended work?” he replied “Plus the level of anxiety and all”. Shortly after he added, “You guys remember that I am a product of working there. I am a drunk and I am ashamed of that...” Earlier he had remarked, “I was running around like an idiot, but this is a result of the efforts of my employment, working for David Jones Limited”.19 These answers are inconsistent with his sworn evidence, but consistent with him being disenchanted with David Jones.20 The video images taken on the night of 27 July show him walking purposefully without any swaying, uncertainty or unsteadiness on his feet. In other words inconsistent with his being dazed and confused. He does not present in his movements as dazed, confused, distressed or under the influence of alcohol or any other substance.21 One video image shows the appellant with something in his hand - I think it was his right hand - held behind his back. I have a reference - video image of 19.54, that is nineteen hours and fifty-four minutes. While the image is unclear, not permitting clear identification of the item, it is consistent with being long and thin, such as a screwdriver, tyre lever or jemmy. His evidence is it was a fixture that he had tripped over. He picked it up because he did not want anyone else to trip over it. Yet, he does not appear interested in reporting the injury, or delivering the fixture to someone in authority.22 It is also to be remembered that the cleaning staff were at David Jones, cleaning at night. The reference in the evidence to injury comes, because he complained of hurting his back.23 The appellant has a familiarity with cameras such as the one stolen, and how these cameras fitted within the plastic glass dome. The significance of that is that he would have, it seems, at least a knowledge, if not the skill, as to how to deal with it.24 The appellant, who was tasked with property protection, failed to see the person who stole the camera or had a ladder en route to the camera, at a time moments before its removal when he was in the immediate vicinity of the lost camera.25 The video evidence was selected by the risk manager who claimed there was nothing of interest on any other CCTV footage. While that evidence was contested in the trial before the magistrate, I am satisfied that her evidence is correct. None of the evidence shows any other single person in all relevant areas.26 I accept the risk manager that all relevant video footage had been captured on the CD placed into evidence.27 The accused’s account is that he walked around the floor after leaving a toilet. He headed towards the escalators on the way to the staff door. On the way he recalled a customer who earlier that day reported she had lost a ring. Although he and another man had earlier looked for it, they had no success. He decided she deserved a second chance. He walked up the escalator to Table Eight, looked for the ring, did not find it, made his way to the men’s suits, looked there, men’s knitwear, underwear and socks, and looked in those places. 28 That evidence appears to contradict the video image earlier referred to. He does not present on the video as looking for an object that may have fallen to the floor or onto a counter. Nor does he give that account in the interview undertaken by the risk manager. In fairness that may because he was never asked, as it seems to me, why he was there, simply what he knew.29 The normal method of exiting the store was via the staff door - that was a store security measure. The appellant was in the business of property loss prevention, that is he was security-conscious. Yet he made no attempt, having exited the door in circumstances where the alarm would have been triggered, to return to the staff door and report his experience and allay any concerns that security might have as a consequence of the door alarm being activated. The appellant knew which cash registers were monitored by a CCTV security camera and which were not.30 Magistrate Brad, who had the advantage of observing the witnesses, did not regard the appellant’s supporting witness, Christopher John Tancred, to be a witness of truth. Significantly, Tancred’s evidence was of being recruited earlier - on 27 July - by the appellant to look for the lady’s lost ring.31 I must be guided by the learned magistrate’s observations and comments regarding the credibility of Tancred. The learned magistrate, who had the opportunity of observing the accused, found he lied about his movements on level four. He comes to that finding in part based upon the appellant’s account of his movements, and in part by analysis of the contents of the CCTV footage. 32 He also rejected the appellant’s evidence of looking for the ring. Again, that rejection was based upon an examination of the CCTV footage and the appellant’s explanation. 33 The learned magistrate’s finding, in effect that the accused was not a credible witness, is not in those circumstances a finding that I am required to give weight to, because the finding depends upon the magistrate’s viewing of the CCTV footage and not upon personal observations of the appellant whilst delivering his evidence.34 Independently, although for much the same reasons, I come to a view that the appellant’s account is to be rejected. I have taken into account the appellant’s prior good character, on both the question of his credibility and the likelihood that someone with a long working record and his good character is likely to have stolen from his employer.35 As earlier remarked, the appellant was resentful of his employer, blamed the employer for his stress, anxiety and panic attacks. The appellant had been drinking, although not nearly to the extent given in his evidence. The alcohol he had consumed though, made him more disinhibited than he otherwise would have been and impacted upon his judgment. I have no doubt he was motivated by his resentment of DJ’s.36 I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt the appellant was the person who disconnected the camera. What follows from that is that I am also satisfied the person who disconnected the camera was responsible for the malicious damage to a number of cash registers, including the four cash registers subject of charges. 37 I am satisfied he stole the contents of the cash registers, having successfully opened them. I am satisfied he stole the camera.38 I have already indicated I am satisfied he broke out of DJ’s. I am satisfied that breaking out was unlawful in the circumstances.39 I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of his guilt on all five matters. I dismiss his conviction appeal.40 In respect of sentence, I have already entertained discussion on that matter with counsel on the last occasion, and indicated that if I did come to a view that the conviction appeals were to be dismissed, that the sentences would be confirmed, save and except that, where prison sentences were ordered I would have those sentences suspended. I intend to follow that course unless I am persuaded to the contrary.41 The formal orders I make are: the conviction appeals are dismissed, the convictions confirmed, the terms of imprisonment imposed by the learned magistrate are confirmed. However, they are suspended conditional upon the appellant entering into a bonds under s 12 to be of good behaviour for the relevant length of each of the sentences.42 The sentences of six months are all confirmed. The sentence of breaking out - a sentence of eighteen months is quashed and in lieu a sentence of nine months is imposed. It, too, is suspended. Now the bonds are to date from today. and so it seems to me that - he has to enter at least two bonds - one of six months and one of nine months. There must be at least two bonds, and maybe five. They'll work it out in the Registry. One bond (or more) must be six months, relating to the four malicious damage sentences, - the other, relating to the larceny and breaking out must be a nine month bond.

     SENTENCE 
    1 HIS HONOUR: About 12.30am on Sunday 26 November 2005, Coy Gary Saunders and another man went to the Taree Leagues Sports Club in company with a third male who has not been identified. At 12.30 the club had ceased trading, the doors were closed, twelve patrons inside the premises were finishing their final drinks. There were four duty staff members cleaning up after the night's trading. An entertainer was also present, in the process of packing up equipment.2 It may be worth noting that at least two of the persons whose identity is known, this offender and the co-offender with whom I am also dealing, are young men. This offender was aged twenty at the time of the offence and his co-offender aged eighteen. The age of the unidentified male is unknown.3 They loitered in the vicinity of the front door of the club. When someone left the front locked door to exit the premises, the offender and the co-accused pushed past her and ran into the club. The lower half of their faces were covered by clothing pulled up. They ran to the main area of the bar. The woman leaving was alarmed and yelled. She ran back into the club and tried to alert the others to the presence of the intruders.4 One offender ran to the front of the TAB cashiers cage. The other offender, Saunders ran to the bar, jumped over the bar and moved towards the cash register.5 A staff member moved towards this offender took hold of him, pulled him away from the TAB area and held him against a wall. He struggled violently, elbowed the staff member in the mouth cutting his bottom lip and causing it to bleed. The staff member fell to the ground. Another staff member came to his assistance and both took hold of the accused in an attempt to detain him. He struggled violently against these two and all fell to the floor. A male patron then came to the assistance of the two staff members and together all three attempted to arrest the offender. He continued to struggle violently and in the course of that struggle bit the second staff member deep on his bicep. He bit the patron on the left thigh.6 As a result of the fracas a number of patrons used their mobiles to call for police assistance. Police arrived within minutes, handcuffed the offenders and placed them under police arrest. When Saunders was arrested he called upon his co-offenders to stop struggling and surrender. He was placed in a cage vehicle and conveyed to Taree.7 During the incident, particularly the struggle, he threatened to assault the staff members, stated he knew he was going to gaol and when he came out he would come back to the club and assault them. It was observed by the police at the time of his arrest that he was moderately to well affected by alcohol or a drug. He claimed to have a knife in his shirt that he would use on the three men if they did not let him up. They were fearful that they may be stabbed if they let go him. When searched though, he was not in possession of any weapons.8 As a consequence of his involvement he was committed for sentence on a number of charges. These are the charges: assault occasioning actual bodily harm x2, attempt robbery in company, and having face blackened, disguised, with intent to commit indictable offence. Objective Criminality9 In assessing the objective criminality of the offence, the first thing to note is that the attempted robbery itself was not successful. The offender attempted to rob the Taree Sports Club of the money in the till whilst being in the company of Michael Marr and another male.10 As I say the objective seriousness of this offence is significant because of the number of people who were present and put in some danger by the escapades of these three men particularly once the arrests had been attempted.11 The offences of robbery in company carries a maximum of twenty years imprisonment. As such, it is one of the more serious offences on the criminal calendar. I am satisfied it was not planned or to put it another way, was a spontaneous offence although clearly there was an intent to commit a robbery prior to them entering into the premises. I am satisfied that the plan, if that is the correct word, was hatched but moments before in the course of drinking somewhere else. As this offender said in evidence to me, it is not an offence he would have done if he had not been drinking. I am satisfied that is probably so. In other words, I am prepared to accept that the alcohol impacted upon his capacity and willingness to make sensible judgments and he was more disinhibited than he otherwise would have been had he not been drinking.12 The probation and parole report for the Court in Taree where he initially pleaded - described him as being the eldest of four children, his parents separating when he was about eight years of age.13 However, because of the family dynamics, as often happens with Indigenous children, he was raised by his grandparents. He had lived, till about the age of ten with his dad. His father treated him violently on occasions and he returned to live with his grandparents. He gave evidence of experiencing and drinking alcohol at aged 11 and smoking cannabis aged 13, certainly while he was still barely pubescent. As often happens with Indigenous children, because they do their drinking and smoking of cannabis with other teenage lads and sometimes those older than teenagers, he came under the influence of more sophisticated offenders in Taree and became involved in more serious criminal offending.14 Hopefully when he is now joining those in the park and the younger kids there he is trying to say something more sensible to them about the way in which they behave rather than have them walk in the same footsteps he walked in. He has been the subject of several juvenile control orders. He has spent several periods in Juvenile Justice detention.15 Approximately in September 2005, a child was born to him and his girlfriend. That child is already having a bit of a tough run because initially his partner was in juvenile detention and was not released until April of last year when the child was seven months old. He too was in custody for those early months of the child’s life. I think he had been with the child for a couple of months and then went into custody.16 A year ago when he came before me in Taree I indicated to him that I would give him an opportunity to demonstrate that he could rehabilitate; that I particularly wanted the cannabis and the alcohol issues addressed. I received reports from Bennalong Haven where he was admitted. 17 The report from Bennalong Haven of 30 November says this, that the offender commenced using alcohol at the age of fourteen and marijuana at the age of nine. I think the evidence before me was slightly different. 
     
      
       
        
        “Has shown a determined attitude to getting sober. He appears to be motivated to change his life because he wants to establish a family with his children and wife. He has genuine remorse about his behaviour and his past. His Taree larger family have given him good standards if he remains sober. His family stand to assist his development of personal goals and initiate an initiative. The offender is respectful and keen to do his best during his time in treatment. He expressed a wish and intention to write an apology for his recent actions. This should assist his current feelings of guilt and assist his process of treatment. He has attended group meetings and has been an active listener. He appreciates being able to talk to staff and clients and feels any stress is released as a result of discussion. He appears to be positively acting to treatment, urine screens have been negative. He recognises marijuana as his number one problem followed by alcohol.” 
        
       
      
    18 He had gone to that program as a consequence of telling Mr McGrath of his willingness to enter the residential drug program. Mr McGrath being the author of the pre-sentence report on 22 March. He has expressed to Mr McGrath that he is ashamed of his behaviour on the night. He has, so far as Mr McGrath can tell, genuine remorse. He claimed he wanted an opportunity to personally apologise to the victim of his offences and Mr McGrath picked that up in a recommendation to him that once his sentencing had been completed he could pursue a restorative justice initiative to apologise. That would require a Department Restorative Justice Victim Conference and all of that can only be arranged post his sentence.19 He has written to me as perhaps was suggested by the Bennalong Haven psychologist with whom he had been dealing, this letter: 
     
      
      “I am writing this letter in a last ditch effort because the last six months there has been a real change in my thoughts and actions. I’ve realised that I don’t want this life in gaol and I don’t want to spend the rest of my life in and out of gaol. I’ve tried to better myself so that when I'm released I can adapt back into the community to do something useful with my life. In the last six months things have happened, I am sorry for the people I have hurt and if I could take it back I would. Since my daughter has come into my life I have realised I am no longer a boy I’m a man and have to accept my responsibilities or my daughter will never know her father. I’ve already missed six months of her life and I want to be able to bond with her so I don’t miss her first words, first steps. I want her to know who her father is as I didn’t have the opportunity to know my father as good as I wanted to. It’s something I would regret for the rest of my life. If I didn’t get that opportunity to be there for my daughter, I would also like to continue my schooling to better my future.” 
      
    20 I am satisfied that the offender has made a genuine effort to rehabilitate. If he is able in the environment in which he lives to come to grips with his abuse of marijuana and his abuse of alcohol, if he can find himself employment (he expressed an interest in brick laying and in landscaping), he is likely to be making a useful contribution to the community in which he lives and likely to be an example for other Indigenous people.21 It is a fact that a greater percentage of Indigenous people do not drink at all by comparison to the white population. It is a fact that Indigenous people are participating actively in this community in the fields of sport, in the fields of tourism, in the fields of agriculture, in the field of art, that is painting, in the theatre. Those who drag the Indigenous community down are those who take away from the achievements of the other Indigenous people.22 What I would have proposed to do in this case is to have imposed an overall sentence of eighteen months imprisonment. I come to the figure of eighteen months by discounting the figure that initially had in mind which was two years by twenty five percent for the plea of guilty and for the contrition exhibited by the offender. I also now embrace within that figure the progress made in rehabilitation. In picking that figure I also have in mind that he has been under supervision of what Chief Justice Garfield Barwick spoke of as “compulsory rehabilitation” for the past twelve months (see Griffiths v The Queen (1977) 137 CLR 293. 23 I now have in mind an overall sentence of eighteen months imprisonment. From that figure must be subtracted the period he did in full time custody.24 From the eighteen months comes seven months leaving eleven months. I do not intend to set a parole period. Hopefully I will not have to. The formal order I make are these - they do not appear to have committed him for the larceny or the attempted larceny.Formal Orders25 Would you stand up please Mr Saunders. For the offence that you on 26 November 2005 at Taree assaulted Barry Richards thereby occasioning to him actual bodily harm, I sentence you to six months imprisonment, fixed term.26 In respect of the assault on Gary Chapman at the same time and place, occasioning to him actual bodily harm, six months imprisonment. Assuming they were the two that were committed. There is a third one there.27 In respect of the offence that you attempt to rob the Taree Leagues Sports Club of certain property whilst being in the company of Michael Marr I convict you. On that offence I sentence you to eleven months imprisonment. On the offence that you had your face disguised, that is with the clothing pulled up over it, with intent to commit an indictable offence, namely robbery I convict you of that offence and I sentence you for that offence to six months imprisonment.28 Pursuant to s 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act conditional upon you entering into a bond to be of good behaviour for six months and conditional upon you entering into a bond to be of good behaviour for eleven months, I will suspend the six months sentences and the eleven months sentence. The conditions of the bond are that you will continue to be supervised by Probation and Parole. It is a matter of whether you are prepared to accept that condition or would you sooner go to gaol. It is not a hard choice to make is it?29 It may not be a hard choice to make here, but it becomes a harder choice out in the community, because if you do not accept the supervision what happens? You are in breach of your bond and you come back here. There is not a lot I can do about it then because the prison sentence already exists. Do you understand?OFFENDER: Yeah.HIS HONOUR: The other reason to accept supervision is they are there to help you and you seem to have been making progress.30 I order he enter into a bond to be of good behaviour for a period of six months. I order he enter into a bond to be of good behaviour for eleven months pursuant to s 12 in each case. The condition of each bond is that he accept the supervision of probation and parole and to follow all reasonable directions of the Probation and Parole Service. If probation and parole want him to be released they should write to me and inform me of his progress.HIS HONOUR: So the back up charge, what do you want me to do with that?SHARMA: The back up charge your Honour that’s sequence 1.HIS HONOUR: Do you want to withdraw it?SHARMA: I do.HIS HONOUR: Leave is given to withdraw.

    JUDGMENT1 HIS HONOUR: Some time ago Jaroslav Murany was charged by the Crown on an indictment containing two offences. The first was an allegation of affray and the second being an allegation of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm upon a man by the name of Garry Reagan. The jury at an earlier trial could not agree and so the matter has come before me today for the purposes of a re-trial.2 Before the jury was empanelled however, an application was made under s 17 of the Criminal Procedure Act that the second count on the indictment be quashed. The basis of that application is that the second count is said to contain within it a latent duplicity. In order to appreciate the basis of that submission it will be necessary to spend some time outlining the case made against by Mr Murany by the Crown.3 Annexed to the affidavit of Mr Katsoolis, Mr Murany’s solicitor, was the Crown’s opening from the earlier trial. That makes it clear that the Crown has always put its case against the accused on an alternative basis. The evidence will establish, according to the Crown, that on 26 January 2005 for reasons which I need not go into, Mr Reagan and the accused departed an area near Crown Street, Surry Hills and went up Collins Street. It does not appear to be disputed that after the two of them went into that area, Mr Reagan, who was riding a bicycle at the time ended up with significant injuries. It is the manner in which he suffered those injuries which is to be disputed. The only two people who were in a position to know what happened were the accused and Mr Reagan. There were eye witnesses to earlier events but when Mr Reagan and Mr Murany went up Collins Street they went out of sight of those eye witnesses. Mr Reagan cannot remember what happened. He suffered a fractured skull and so no doubt his inability to remember is related to the injuries he suffered.4 The Crown case is therefore put on two bases. The first scenario is that Mr Reagan fell off his bicycle whilst being chased by the accused. The second scenario is that the accused caught up to Mr Reagan, and punched him to the left side of his head, which caused Mr Reagan to become unconscious and fall off his bicycle striking the right side of his head upon the ground. 5 The Crown has medical evidence apparently in support of that second scenario, but because the first scenario is more consistent with a version of events given by the appellant to a friend of his the Crown also puts its case against the appellant on an alternate basis. Thus even if the jury do not accept the Crown’s scenario based on the medical evidence, the Crown submission will be that it would nevertheless convict the accused on the alternative scenario which is I repeat, that Mr Reagan fell off his bicycle whilst being chased by the accused, the accused being legally responsible for that event. That application of legal responsibility would be consistent with legal principle (see cases such as Royall v The Queen (1991) 172 CLR 378).6 So to summarise, the Crown intends to present a case against the accused as far as the second count is concerned based on alternative and mutually inconsistent factual scenarios. Mr King, who appears for the accused says that this creates a latent duplicity.7 The first thing to note is that cases where alternative scenarios are put by a Crown can be divided into two categories. The first is where the same factual circumstances can result in criminal responsibility on two separate legal bases. An example of that is to be found in the decision of R v Cramp (1999) 110 A Crim R 198. In that case the Crown advanced a case of manslaughter against the accused based on alternative legal consequences rather than alternative factual consequences. It was said that that accused was guilty of manslaughter either on the basis of gross criminal negligence or unlawful and dangerous act. On appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal it was suggested that the trial Judge should have required the jury to be unanimous about either gross criminal negligence or unlawful and dangerous act before they could convict the accused. It was said that if, for example, six members of the jury thought the accused was guilty on the basis of unlawful and dangerous act and the other six thought that he as guilty on the basis of gross criminal negligence, that nevertheless a verdict of guilty could not be returned. The Court of Criminal appeal rejected that submission. It is important to recognise that that case says little if anything about the situation that faces me this morning. R v Cramp is not about this case. R v Cramp is about the situation where the same factual scenarios can have different legal consequences.8 R v Cramp says nothing, or nothing much at least, about the present situation, beyond assisting as an example of the acceptability of a judge sentencing after a Crown case is put on alternative bases. I mention that aspect because that is one of the matters relied on by Mr King. He refers to the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Giam (1999) 104 A Crim R 416. There the Chief Justice with whom the other members of the court agreed, referred to the concept duplicity and said that it had a function in ensuring that the sentencing judge had before him or her a clear indication of the facts that had been found by the jury. Mr King relies on that and says that if his client were convicted on the second count on the indictment, I would not know which of the two alternative scenarios was accepted by the jury. He says I would thus have difficulty in sentencing his client. But as R v Cramp illustrates, that is not an insurmountable problem. Indeed the Court of Criminal Appeal decision of R v Isaacs (1997) 41 NSWLR 374 shows that the fact that a Judge has to select between alternative ways in which the Crown puts its case when sentencing is a well accepted consequence of the present division of responsibility between Judge and jury. There are many cases, especially where murder is the charge and a verdict of manslaughter is returned, that the judge does not know for example whether the jury was unanimously finding manslaughter on the basis of provocation or unanimously on the basis of diminished responsibility or half and half.9 More dramatic examples of the sentencing Judge choosing between alternative factual scenarios when sentencing can be found in cases such as R v Serratore (1999) 48 NSWLR 101 from New South Wales R v Gianetto [1997] 1 Cr App R 1 and R v Thatcher (1987) 39 DLR (4th) 275 from Canada. These three cases from three different jurisdictions all have in common the situation that a person was charged with murder, (in two cases with his wife and one case of his girlfriend), but the Crown could not say whether the particular accused killed his victim or got someone else to do it. Not in New South Wales, not in Canada, and not in England is the consequence that the Crown is unable to present its case on that basis. 10 There is no legal distinction between the present case and those three cases which I have just mentioned. When I asked Mr King to point to any legal distinction, he was unable to do so. But Mr King relied on the decision of R v Giam to which I will now return. It has to be noted that R v Giam is very different to this case. In that case there were in each count, two separate false statements to be considered under each count of making a false statement. However, in this case there is only one set of injuries said to amount to grievous bodily harm. The decision in R v Giam was guided by the words of the offence which referred to the making of a “false statement” (that word being in the singular). The decision in R v Giam is unsurprising given the offence charged, the elements of that offence and the fact that the Crown was relying on separate false statements under each count on the indictment. The decision in R v Giam is not authority for the proposition that the Crown is unable to present a case based on two alternative factual scenarios leading to the one consequence, in this case, grievous bodily harm. The case which binds me is not R v Giam but R v Serratore. And that case is consistent with similar decisions to be found in other jurisdictions throughout the world.11 For those reasons the application to quash the indictment is refused.

      JUDGMENT  
      (on application by Accused for adjournment of the trial - see PT968) 
       
       
      
    1 JOHNSON J: This is an application by the Accused for adjournment of a trial which is presently fixed to commence before a jury next Monday, 5 March 2007.  
     
      
    2 I commenced the hearing of pre-trial applications with respect to this matter in July 2006. The trial date of 5 March 2007 was identified for the first time on 21 November 2006 (PT560). It was confirmed on 28 November 2006 that there would be a jury empanelled not before 5 March 2007 (PT572). Accordingly, the trial date has been known for a significant period of time.  
     
      
    3 The basis of the application is that monies are required by the Accused to fund his defence and that it is expected that those funds will become available at a point of time in the near future.  
     
      
    4 As part of the application, it is contended for the Accused that he has sought to make appropriate arrangements with respect to the funding of his defence, but that due to what is said to be a mistaken transfer of monies, the sum involved has ended up in the trust account of a firm of solicitors in Brisbane, and that there is current controversy as to whether those monies will be repaid by that firm of solicitors.  
     
      
    5 The present application is not brought in accordance with the principles in Dietrich v The Queen (1992) 177 CLR 292 at 315 whereby the Accused claims that he is indigent and, through no fault of his own, is unable to obtain or maintain legal representation for his trial. Rather, the application is of the type identified by Barr AJ in R v Yuill (unreported, 1 November 1995, BC9501744) at page 23, where the Accused makes application for an adjournment of the trial to allow steps to be taken to ensure that monies are available to fund his defence. 
     
      
    6 Broad discretionary considerations apply on an adjournment application. Section 40 Criminal Procedure Act 1986 is the statutory source of the present application for an adjournment. 
     
      
    7 An affidavit has been read in support of the application, being an affidavit of Edmond William Coady sworn 1 March 2007 which is accompanied by a substantial number of annexures. Mr Coady has given evidence on the application.  
     
      
    8 Given the time of the day and the urgency of this application, it is neither necessary nor desirable to recount in any detail the picture revealed by the evidence.  
     
      
    9 It is sufficient to note that the Accused is said, prior to November 1996, to have made arrangements through a litigation funder in Malaysia for a sum of $785,000.00 to be available to fund his defence of this trial. In stating that proposition there is a risk of oversimplifying the position, because the documentary evidence points to a rather elaborate range of corporations and individuals who have played a part in that arrangement. Indeed, the sum of $785,000.00, it is said, is the money of Prepaid Professional Administration Limited (“Prepaid”). There is before the Court, in the form of Exhibit A, a document signed by officers of Prepaid which states that the effect of the litigation funding arrangements reached in Malaysia is to obtain funds to apply for the defence of the present Accused. 
     
      
    10 It appears that, in November 2006, a transfer of funds was made. It is alleged that, as a result of a mistake, the sum of money of $785,000.00 was paid into the trust account of Home Wilkinson Lowry, a Brisbane firm of solicitors. Thereafter, it appears that Home Wilkinson Lowry maintains an entitlement to a sum of between $190,000.00 and $250,000.00 by way of outstanding fees. The solicitors seek to claim that sum against the sum which has been transferred into their account.  
     
      
    11 It appears that Home Wilkinson Lowry have refused to refund to Prepaid the balance, being the difference between $250,000.00 and $785,000.00. As I understand it, the total amount remains sitting in the trust account of that firm.  
     
      
    12 The documents in evidence on the application point to a controversy about this sum in affidavits filed in proceedings in the Supreme Court of Queensland involving a company Prescience Communications Limited (“Prescience”). 
     
      
    13 In separate proceedings in the Supreme Court of Queensland, Prepaid filed a Statement of Claim on 27 February 2007 nominating Home Wilkinson Lowry as the Defendant. According to the Statement of Claim, the pleading was settled by Mr A Morris QC and Mr AC Barlow of counsel. The Statement of Claim asserts that there has been a payment made under a mistake of fact to Home Wilkinson Lowry and that that firm has been unjustly enriched to the extent of $785,000.00. Demand has been made for the return of that sum, but the sum has not been repaid. 
     
      
    14 On the face of the Statement of Claim filed three days ago, the Defendant has 28 days to file a Defence. That is the extent of the litigious activity to date with respect to this sum which the Accused submits is critical to his ability to fund his defence for this trial.  
     
      
    15 The affidavit of Mr Coady, to which I have referred, states, in paragraphs 34 and 35, that he had been advised by Mr Andrews, a Queensland solicitor acting for Prepaid, that a period of 28 days was required to file a Defence and thereafter it would be possible to commence proceedings as an urgent action seeking summary judgment. Mr Coady says, ""based on my research and the opinion of senior counsel in Queensland"" (Mr Morris QC), he believes that the Plaintiff in those proceedings (Prepaid) “has good chances of success in the action”. 
     
      
    16 Mr Coady also states (in paragraph 37) that, should the Accused not be able to pay the funds from Queensland into his trust account on or before Monday 5 March 2007, he (Mr Coady) will not be able to continue his retainer of counsel nor continue to represent the Accused.  
     
      
    17 Earlier today, I raised with Mr Sutherland SC, for the Accused, the question whether, if the present adjournment application is refused, it would be a case of counsel returning the brief or their instructions being withdrawn. I was informed it was the latter. I infer that, in the event that the application for adjournment is refused, the legal representatives for the Accused would no longer represent him.  
     
      
    18 The ethical considerations arising in this context, where a serious criminal trial is imminent, and where counsel is foreshadowing the cessation of their appearance, is not a matter upon which I have taken detailed submissions. It is sufficient to say that I am presented with the position where, if this application is refused, counsel and solicitors would withdraw from the case. The ethical consequences of that step would be a matter for them.  
     
      
    19 If that event occurred, and the adjournment application was refused, then the prospect would be that the Accused would appear in person on Monday morning. In the absence of any other application, or if a further application by him was refused, the trial would proceed with him unrepresented. 
     
      
    20 The Crown submits that the Accused is a legal practitioner with considerable expertise in the field which is the subject of this litigation, and with deep knowledge of it.  
     
      
    21 As is apparent from my earlier judgments on pre-trial applications, this litigation has extended far and wide in the Courts of New South Wales, and there has been an earlier trial which led to a hung jury.  
     
      
    22 After lunch today, Mr Coady indicated, following further telephone discussions with Mr Andrews (who it seems had spoken, in turn, with counsel in Queensland), that a second line of attack was intended with respect to the sum of $785,000.00. It was said that a notice would issue under the Trust Accounts Act 1973 (Qld) and that this should trigger a process which ought see the monies paid into Court, thereby providing an opportunity for an expeditious determination of any disputed claim on the monies. It was said that notices to commence this process would issue, but clearly no litigation or proceedings have been commenced in Queensland so far to that end.  
     
      
    23 I am puzzled by the fact that senior and junior counsel in Queensland, who no doubt were called upon to advise Prepaid on the best litigious route to deal with the present problem (and whom I infer, would be well aware of the Accused’s imminent trial in this State) would not, as a matter of first resort, have chosen a claim under the Trust Accounts Act 1973 (Qld). There is no evidence to explain how such a claim has now arisen, as a form of afterthought. Nevertheless, it is now said that this is going to be done.  
     
      
    24 Mr Walsh, counsel for the Accused, submits that the Court’s discretion ought be exercised in favour of an adjournment, that a determinate period of adjournment is sought, that the interests of justice, the interests of the Crown, the witnesses and the Accused having been taken into account, the balance should come down on the side of an adjournment. Of course, an underlying factor in the defence application is Mr Coady's confident expectation of a speedy and favourable resolution of this matter. Whether that confidence is justified is, of course, a matter which will be tested in future days. 
     
      
    25 The Crown opposes the application for an adjournment. The Crown submits that the prospect of recovery of the funds is so uncertain that no adjournment should be allowed on that basis. It is submitted that the affidavits already in existence in the Prescience litigation point to the existence of significant factual disputes, and that it is optimistic in the extreme to think that there would be a speedy and favourable resolution of this matter in a manner which would see the funds being available for this Accused for this trial.  
     
      
    26 The Crown points to the fact that there appears to be the prospect of competing parties seeking the funds, with the prospect of the Provisional Liquidator of Prescience claiming an interest. There appears to be a question whether Prepaid is a creditor of Prescience, so that the Provisional Liquidator of Prescience will become involved in this way.  
     
      
    27 I have carefully considered the arguments that have been raised.  
     
      
    28 An application for adjournment made, on this type of ground and at this stage proximate to the trial, must be considered carefully. The Accused says that he wishes to be represented by counsel and solicitors who have appeared for him now, in the case of the counsel for some months and in the case of the solicitors, for some years. The prospect of a trial with the Accused unrepresented, although a hypothetical prospect at this stage, is still a prospect which I can consider, and such a process has well known disadvantages to the criminal justice system. 
     
      
    29 On balance, I am satisfied that an adjournment ought to be allowed. it will not, however, be an adjournment for eight weeks, or five weeks, or four weeks.  
     
      
    30 It seems to me that the predictions of Mr Coady, and the identification of steps that will be taken, ought to be tested by the allowance of some limited time for those things to be done and for Mr Coady's hopes to be measured against actual events. 
     
      
    31 I am prepared to adjourn the trial for a two-week period. I do that on the basis that the matter will be listed before me for directions in one week's time, and I expect there to be proper evidence before me then of steps which have been taken by or on behalf of the Accused, or those acting in his interests in Queensland, with respect to the recovery of these funds. If, in one week's time, it seems to me that there is an uncertain and complicated future likely with respect to this issue, so that the resolution of the claim on these funds will take some considerable time, then I am not likely to be persuaded that any further adjournment of the trial should take place. I will, of course, hear any submissions or application made, but there will need to be evidence of action taken, and not mere expressions of hope and expectation. 
     
      
    32 If it appears to be the position next Friday, that the Queensland dispute will be resolved prior to 19 March 2007, it will be my expectation that Mr Sutherland SC and Mr Walsh, Mr Coady and Mr Lambros will be in a position for this trial to commence on 19 March 2007. 
     
      
    33 If it is the position that the issue is unresolved, then the Crown's submission that this trial should proceed, whether the Accused is represented or not, will attract considerable weight given the history of this matter. I will, of course, hear any further submissions or any application that may be made, but the trial will not be delayed indefinitely.  
     
      
    34 Accordingly, I vacate the trial date listed for 5 March 2007.  
     
      
    35 I stand the matter over for trial to commence on Monday, 19 March 2007.  
     
      
    36 I direct that this matter be listed before me at 10.00 am next Friday, 9 March 2007, on which occasion I will assess the action taken by and on behalf of the Accused with respect to the matters ventilated in this application and in my reasons.  
     
      
    37 I direct that the Accused serve upon the Crown, and provide to my Associate, by 4 pm on Thursday 8 March 2007 any affidavit or other documentary material upon which he will seek to rely at the directions hearing listed for next Friday. 
     
      
    38 The Accused is required to attend next Friday. Bail is continued on the current conditions until 10.00 am 9 March 2007.

      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1 JOHNSON J: On 20 November 1990, the Applicant, Daniel Keith Pollock, was convicted by a jury of the murder of Terrence Damien Ryan at Wollongong on 9 May 1988. Following conviction, the Applicant was sentenced by Wood J (as his Honour then was), pursuant to s.19 Crimes Act 1900, to life imprisonment to date from 20 November 1990.  
     
      
       
      Appeals Against Conviction 
       
      
    2 On 13 April 1992, an appeal against conviction was dismissed by the Court of Criminal Appeal: R v Pollock (Court of Criminal Appeal, unreported, 13 April 1992).  
     
      
    3 On 6 September 2004, application was made pursuant to s.474D Crimes Act 1900 for the Applicant’s case to be referred to the Court of Criminal Appeal upon the basis that there was a doubt or question as to his guilt. The Crown acknowledged that the material relied upon by the Applicant warranted a referral of the case to the Court of Criminal Appeal. On 24 February 2005, having considered the material relied upon by the Applicant and the submissions of the Crown, I referred the whole case to the Court of Criminal Appeal under s.474D to be dealt with as an appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. 
     
      
    4 On 22 September 2005, the Court of Criminal Appeal dismissed the appeal: R v Pollock [2005] NSWCCA 316.  
     
      
       
      The Present Application 
       
      
    5 On 13 March 1997, the Applicant made application for his life sentence to be redetermined pursuant to s.13A Sentencing Act 1989. However, he did not proceed with his application at that time. On 3 April 2000, the Sentencing Act 1989 was repealed and the provisions contained in s.13A of that Act were re-enacted in substantially the same form in Schedule 1 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (“the 1999 Act”) and given effect by s.44(5) of that Act. Provision is made by that Act for the Court to set (or decline to set) a non-parole period and balance of sentence. Under the savings and transitional provisions contained in clause 21 of Schedule 2 of the 1999 Act, the Applicant is to be dealt with in accordance with Schedule 1 of the 1999 Act. 
     
      
    6 The Applicant has served at least eight years of the sentence concerned and is eligible to make the present application: cl.2(1), Schedule 1, 1999 Act. Clause 3, Schedule 1 of the 1999 Act provides for the Court to have regard to certain matters on an application: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        Matters for consideration by Supreme Court 
         
         
        (1) In considering an application in relation to an existing life sentence, the Supreme Court is to have regard to:

            (i) any offence in respect of which a court has found the offender guilty but has not proceeded to conviction, and 
             
             
            (ii) any offence taken into account when the offender was sentenced, but 
            
           
          
         
         
          
          (b) does not include: 
          
         
         
          
           
            
            (i) an offence for which a conviction or finding of guilt has been quashed or set aside within the meaning of Part 4 of the Criminal Records Act 1991, or 
             
             
            (ii) an offence of a class or description prescribed by the regulations.”

        (1) In considering an application referred to in clause 2 (1), the Supreme Court is to have regard to: 
         
         
          
          (a) any reports on the offender made by the Review Council, and any other relevant reports prepared after the offender was sentenced, that are available to the Supreme Court, and 
           
           
          (b) the need to preserve the safety of the community, and 
           
           
          (c) the age of the offender (at the time the offender committed the offence and also at the time the Supreme Court deals with the application), and 
           
           
          (d) in the case of an offender sentenced before 12 January 1990 (the date on which section 463 of the Crimes Act 1900 was repealed by section 5 of the Prisons (Serious Offenders Review Board) Amendment Act 1989), the fact that the sentencing court: 
          
         
         
          
           
            
            (i) would have been aware that an offender sentenced to imprisonment for life was eligible to be released on licence under section 463 of the Crimes Act 1900, and 
             
             
            (ii) would have been aware of the practice relating to the issue of such licences, and 
            
           
          
         
         
          
          (e) any other relevant matter. 
          
         
         
        (2) The regulations may make provision for or with respect to reports referred to in subclause (1), including provisions relating to the matters to be dealt with in reports and the making of reports available to the Supreme Court. 
         
         
        (3) In considering an application referred to in clause 2 (1), the Supreme Court: 
         
         
          
          (a) must have regard to and give substantial weight to any relevant recommendations, observations and comments made by the sentencing court when imposing the sentence concerned, and 
           
           
          (b) must give consideration to adopting or giving effect to the substance of any such recommendations, observations and comments and the intention of the sentencing court when making them, and 
           
           
          (c) to the extent that it declines to adopt or give effect to any such recommendations, observations and comments, must make a record of its reasons for doing so. 
          
         
         
        (4) Subclause (3) (c) does not limit any other requirement that the Supreme Court has, apart from that paragraph, to record the reasons for its decisions.” 
        
       
      
    8 Clauses 4 and 5, Schedule 1 of the 1999 Act provide for the powers of the Court on an application, and the effect of a determination to set a non-parole period:

      Hearing of the Application 
       
      
    9 On 17 November 2006, the Applicant’s life sentence redetermination application came before me for hearing. The Applicant was represented by Ms Burgess of counsel. On the application of the Applicant, and with the consent of the Crown, the hearing of the application proceeded by audio-visual link from the Goulburn Correctional Centre, where the Applicant was detained in custody. Such a procedure is available under s.5BB(2) Evidence (Audio and Audio Visual Links) Act 1998: cf R v Potter [2006] NSWSC 1174. 
     
      
    10 A number of documents were tendered by consent. The Crown tendered a statement of facts dated 23 January 1998, together with a record of interview between the Applicant and police dated 21 March 1989, the remarks on sentence of Wood J of 20 November 1990 and the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal dated 13 April 1992 (Exhibit A) together with an addendum to the statement of facts dated 28 September 2006, accompanied by a trial summary and the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal of 22 September 2005 (Exhibit B). The Crown also tendered the report of the Serious Offenders Review Council (“SORC”) dated 15 August 1997 (Exhibit C) and a supplementary SORC report dated 24 October 2006 (Exhibit D) together with the Applicant’s custodial history (Exhibit E). A victim impact statement of Kerryn Ryan dated 18 October 2006 was tendered by the Crown (Exhibit F). 
     
      
    11 The Applicant tendered a notice of reply to the statement of facts dated 25 August 2003 (Exhibit 1) together with a supplementary notice of reply to the statement of facts, including reports of Dr William Lucas, psychiatrist, dated 7 January 2004 and 14 February 2006 (Exhibit 2). 
     
      
    12 No oral evidence was adduced on the application. 
     
      
       
      Circumstances Surrounding the Offence 
       
      
    13 The following account of the circumstances surrounding the offence is drawn from the statement of facts, which was accepted by the Applicant.  
     
      
    14 In the early hours of 8 May 1988 the victim, Terrence Damien Ryan (aged 23 years), after becoming separated from a friend, found his way into the car park adjacent to the MLC Centre, Wollongong. According to the victim’s friend, the victim was very drunk at that time. 
     
      
    15 He came upon the Applicant (then aged 22 years) who was sitting or squatting on the fire stairs adjacent to the building where he had just administered a shot of heroin to himself. 
     
      
    16 The Applicant was at that location either to sell drugs or stolen video equipment. 
     
      
    17 When the victim came upon the Applicant he was challenged and then punched in the head, whereupon he fell backwards down the stairs, ending up on the concrete below. 
     
      
    18 The Applicant followed him down and formed the impression from his shaking movements that the victim was endeavouring to get to his feet. He thereupon kicked him numerous times in the body, particularly in the abdomen and scrotum.  
     
      
    19 The Applicant took some money from the victim's pockets. As he was endeavouring to go through his wallet or to roll him over for that purpose, he observed a group of people making their way to the area. He then ran from the scene, leaving the victim with fatal injuries.  
     
      
    20 The victim was found by the police about two-and-a-half hours later and was thereupon admitted to hospital. He died in the early hours of the morning of 9 May 1988. 
     
      
    21 Dr Verzosa, Senior Forensic Medical Officer with the Department of Health, deposed that he had conducted a post-mortem examination on the victim on 10 May 1988. The victim incurred, inter alia, three linear abrasions to the head (two to the right frontal area and one at the back of the head), and a fracture of the right orbital plate and the skull bone, accompanied by a massive subdural haematoma to the right brain hemisphere. These injuries were consistent with impact between the victim's head and the railing or steps of the MLC Centre fire escape, which Dr Verzosa inspected on 11 May 1988. 
     
      
    22 The victim also suffered torn neck ligaments, bruising to the right armpit, abdominal bruising, an intraperitoneal haemorrhage, multiple linear lacerations to the liver, a haematoma of the scrotum and contusion on the left testicle, a fracture of the pubic ramus, a fracture of the iliac crest, abrasions to the right wrist, bruising to the left thigh and bruising to the heel. 
     
      
    23 The abdominal injuries were consistent with the victim having been kicked, the injury to the left testicle with kicking or punching and the lacerations to the right wrist with the victim using it to fend off blows. 
     
      
    24 In cross-examination, Dr Verzosa agreed that the injuries to the victim's genitals may have been caused by his falling from the railing whilst straddling it and that the abrasions to the right wrist could have been due to a fall down the stairs. 
     
      
    25 Mr X, an inmate of Long Bay Gaol deposed that he was in the Special Programme Unit at the Metropolitan Remand Centre at that gaol between 20 May 1988 and 7 June 1988. In May of that year, he was reading a newspaper article about the discovery of the body of the victim. It happened that the Applicant was standing next to him at that time. The Applicant asked Mr X to read that article to him. As he was reading it, the Applicant said, ""I done it and it was an accident"". In the trial, Mr X was asked: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. ""What did he say? 
         
        A. He said that at the night when it happened he was trying to sell some dope and he couldn't sell none so he decided to have it himself and he went to where he usually had it. He said it was in the back lane up the top - on a fire escape, a set of stairs. 
         
         
        Q. Did he say what happened then? 
         
        A. Yes, he said that just as he was putting his shot away, a man come up the stairs and appeared in front of him. 
         
         
        Q. Yes, and did he say what happened then? 
         
        A. Yes, he said he put his hand in his jumper as if there was a gun to hold the bloke up and the bloke kept on saying, ‘How's it going, mate? That's not a gun. What's the problem, mate?’ 
         
         
        Q. Now, did the accused say what happened next? 
         
        A. Yes, he said he punched the bloke in the head and he fell backwards down the stairs. 
         
         
        Q. Yes, and did anything happen when he was down the stairs? 
         
        A. Yes, he said he fell backwards down the stairs and fell on the concrete down below and he was shaking, so he kept on kicking him until he knocked him out. 
         
         
        Q. Did he say where he kicked him?  
         
        A. In the head and in the body. 
         
         
        Q. Can you remember him describing in his words any particular parts of the body? 
         
        A. Yes, he said in the balls and in the head. He said it looked like he was getting up so he kept on kicking him.” 
        
       
      
    26 Mr Y, another inmate of Long Bay Gaol, deposed that he shared the same cell with the Applicant in February 1989. As they were playing cards in the cell, they had a conversation in which there was a mention about the discovery of the body of the victim. The Applicant started off by saying: 
     
      
       
        
        ""I was down in Wollongong selling some gear. On this particular night I went to my usual spot to have a shot. I was standing there, putting the shot away into my arm, when an old drunk started coming up the stairs and busted me. So I king-hit him and he rolled down the stairs and landed on the bottom. 
         
         
        I finished putting my shot away and then I went down to the bottom of the stairs to where he was and the old bloke was trying to get off the ground, so I laid the boot into him and gave him a kicking. 
         
         
        I started going through his pants and looking at his hands and fingers for jewellery when I noticed some people coming down the road. I panicked and took off. You wouldn't believe it, I found out later that I had kicked the bloke to death"". 
        
       
      
    27 Detective Sergeant Ainsworth deposed that he conveyed the Applicant to the crime scene on 21 March 1989. The following conversation was recorded after the Applicant had been cautioned: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Can you state where you were when Terry Ryan walked into this carpark? 
         
        A. I was sitting on the steel steps with my legs dangling over the edge. I had stolen videos under the steps. 
         
          
         
        [The Applicant pointed out underneath the stairwell] 
         
         
        Q. What happened then? 
         
        A. As I seen him coming I jumped onto the ground just - He was lying on the ground unconscious. I thought he was okay. There was no blood or nothing so I grabbed the videos. 
         
         
        Q. Will you show me where the stolen videos were?  
         
         
        [The Applicant pointed underneath the stairs] 
         
         
        A. Just underneath there, back there on the ground. Then we fought just here. 
         
         
        [Pointing to the area in front of the stairwell]  
         
         
        Q. What happened prior to you leaving? 
         
        A. As I said we were fighting. I kicked him. He was on the ground, he was getting up, I punched him once then I left.” 
        
       
      
    28 On 21 March 1989, Detective Geoffrey Beresford conducted a record of interview with the Applicant which included questions based on admissions that had been made to Mr X (see paragraph 25 above) and acknowledgment of those admissions and of their truth. In particular, the record of interview contained an acknowledgment of a conversation with a person and in circumstances generally of the kind described by Mr X. In relation to the record of interview, Detective Beresford was cross-examined to the effect that a number of answers to questions in it were fabricated.  
     
      
    29 Following the conviction of the Applicant, Wood J on 20 November 1990 passed sentence, including the following remarks concerning the offence (Exhibit A, Tab B, pages 1-3): 
     
      
       
        
        “The prisoner, who denied his involvement in the killing, was found guilty by the jury who, no doubt, accepted the record of interview, and various oral admissions said to have been made by the prisoner to witnesses identified as X and Y, and also to Det Snr Sgt Ainsworth. By their verdict, the jury is to be taken to have been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the substance of those admissions and it is upon the basis of that acceptance by the jury of the facts that I will proceed to sentence. 
         
         
        The offence occurred in the early hours of 8 May 1988 when the deceased, Terrence Ryan, after becoming separated from a friend, found his way into the carpark adjacent to the MLC Centre. He came upon the prisoner who was sitting or squatting on the fire stairs adjacent to the building where he had just administered a shot of heroin to himself. The prisoner was at that location either to sell drugs or stolen video equipment. 
         
          
         
        When the deceased came upon the prisoner he was challenged and then punched in the head, whereupon he fell backwards down the stairs, ending up on the concrete below. The prisoner followed him down and formed the impression from his shaking movements that Mr Ryan was endeavouring to get to his feet. He thereupon kicked him numerous times in the body, particularly in the abdomen and scrotum. He took some money from his pockets and as he was endeavouring to go through his wallet or to roll him over for that purpose, he observed a group of people making their way to the area. He then ran from the scene, leaving his victim with fatal injuries. The victim was not, in fact, found until about two and a half hours later and was thereupon admitted to the Wollongong Hospital. 
         
         
        He was found to have serious injuries including lacerations to the skull and an underlying fracture which caused a subdural haemorrhage. Further, he had displaced ligaments of the first and second cervical vertebra, an obvious bruise in the area of the abdomen overlying the liver which was itself lacerated in a number of places, leading to a significant abdominal haemorrhage. Additionally, the deceased had fractures of the pelvic girdle affecting the pubic ramus, the ischium and the iliac crest. He also suffered fractures of two bones in one wrist and had what were considered to be defensive abrasions and bruising to one arm. 
         
         
        Finally, he had significant contusions and haematoma to the scrotum, perineum and anus, consistent with being kicked on a number of occasions with significant force in that area. It would seem probable that the skull fracture was sustained as the deceased fell backwards down the stairs and that the pelvic fractures occurred when he landed on the ground below. 
        
       
       
        
        I have no doubt that the jury found that to be the case and were further satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the injuries to the liver and scrotum were caused by the act of the prisoner in kicking the deceased on a number of occasions.” 
        
       
      
    30 It is pertinent to observe that the evidence of the Applicant’s admissions to police was likely to have carried significantly greater weight, in the eyes of the jury, than the evidence of admissions to Mr X and Mr Y. As the Court of Criminal Appeal (Simpson J, Howie and Rothman JJ agreeing) said in R v Pollock [2005] NSWCCA 316 at [20]-[23]: 
     
      
       
        
        20. It may here be noted that the admissions said to have been made to Mr X in particular, and also, to a lesser extent, to Mr Y, must have carried very little weight with the jury. Apart from the difficulties inherent in evidence of informers generally (see  
        R v Pollitt 
         [1995] HCA 35; 174 CLR 558), other specific issues casting doubt upon their evidence arose. For example, and perhaps most tellingly, custodial records showed that the appellant and Mr X had never been held in the Protection Unit at the same time. The Crown sought (without evidence) to explain this apparent flaw in Mr X’s evidence by hypothesising that the records were erroneous. Further, Mr X wrongly described the appellant, on one occasion saying that he had a distinctive tattoo on his right arm, an assertion which was readily shown to be incorrect. 
         
         
        21 Mr Y, like Mr X, had a long criminal record and was a regular police informer, hoping and expecting to obtain benefit for himself by providing assistance in relation to the charge against the appellant. Although he had shared a prison cell with the appellant and they had in the past been friends, they had had a significant falling out. His credibility could not have been rated highly by the jury. 
         
         
        22 In all likelihood, it was the evidence given by the police officers of the record of interview and the ‘run around’ that persuaded the jury of the appellant’s guilt. The evidence of the record of interview involved an assessment of the credibility of Detectives Beresford and Gordon in two ways. Firstly, there was the assessment made by Wood J in determining that the answers recorded had been given by the appellant voluntarily, and that the record should therefore be admitted; secondly, it involved the jury’s assessment of the credibility of those police officers both in relation to the assertions by the appellant as to voluntariness, and also as to the fabrication of certain of the answers. 
         
         
        23 Detective Ainsworth’s evidence was in a different category. The appellant did not dispute that he had given the answers or made the statements attributed to him, nor that the photographs accurately depicted the specific locations he had pointed out. Accordingly, no issue as to Detective Ainsworth’s credibility arose. That, obviously, was why Detective Ainsworth was not cross-examined. The issue in the trial about Detective Ainsworth’s evidence was whether what the appellant had said concerned Mr Ryan, or was, as he claimed in his statement, about a different incident. That raised an issue about the appellant’s credibility.” 
        
       
      
    31 I bear these observations in mind given that some of the submissions before me have addressed the question of the objective seriousness of the Applicant’s offence. In assessing these submissions, I will have particular regard to admissions made by the Applicant to police. 
     
      
       
      Other Offences of Which the Applicant has been Convicted 
       
      
    32 Clause 3(1)(b), Schedule 1 of the 1999 Act requires the Court to have regard to all offences, wherever and whenever committed, of which the Applicant has been convicted, so far as this information is reasonably available to the Supreme Court. 
     
      
    33 In the course of his remarks on sentence, Wood J observed that there was no alternative other than to impose a sentence of penal servitude for life. However, his Honour made reference to the Applicant’s background and criminal history (Exhibit A, Tab B, pages 3-4): 
     
      
       
        
        “As I have said, the prisoner denied his involvement in the incident. As a consequence, there is no material before me, which could attract the proviso to the Crimes Act, s 19. The offence occurred, and the committal was conducted prior to the commencement of the amending legislation and, in the circumstances, I have no alternative other than to impose the specified sentence of penal servitude for life. However, for completeness it should be noted that the prisoner, at the time he appears for sentence is a single man aged twenty-five who has had an addiction to heroin and a significant criminal record dating back to 1976. His prior record is confined to offences of dishonesty, comprising multiple convictions for break, enter and steal, larceny, illegal use of a motor vehicle, goods in custody, stealing, absconding and the like. He has no prior conviction for any offence of violence, but at the time he appeared for sentence was subject to terms of imprisonment totalling nine years and six months dating from 5 October 1988, following his conviction in the Sydney District Court on 4 September last on offences of attempted break and enter, break and enter with intent, and possession of house breaking implements. As converted under the Sentencing Act, the existing term is due to expire, as a minimum term, on 18 July 1992 and the additional term is due to expire on 28 September 1994. The prisoner was arrested on the present offence on 21 March 1989. As a consequence, he has been held in custody since that time on remand for this matter and also while serving the existing sentence. In the circumstances, I take the view it is appropriate to date the life sentence, which I must inevitably impose, from today.” 
        
       
      
    34 The Applicant’s criminal history discloses the regular imposition of sentences of imprisonment for offences of dishonesty in and after 1984. Given the issue of totality which has been addressed in submissions on the present application, it is appropriate to set out the sentences which the Applicant was serving at the time of imposition of the present sentence.  
     
      
    35 On 4 September 1989, the Applicant was sentenced in the Sydney District Court to a total term of penal servitude for nine-and-a-half years with a non-parole period of six years, with both periods to date from 5 October 1988. These sentences were imposed for offences of break enter and steal, break and enter with intent to commit a felony and possession of housebreaking implements. 
     
      
    36 On 28 August 1990, the Applicant was sentenced in the Wollongong District Court to concurrent terms of penal servitude for three years to date from 25 May 1990 and to expire on 24 May 1993 with respect to offences of break enter and steal and larceny.  
     
      
    37 As Wood J observed, the Applicant’s existing terms of imprisonment imposed in 1989 and 1990, as converted under the Sentencing Act 1989, were due to expire, as a minimum term on 18 July 1992 with the additional term to expire on 28 September 1994. 
     
      
    38 Wood J directed that the Applicant’s sentence of life imprisonment date from 20 November 1990. Accordingly, that sentence operated concurrently with other sentences of imprisonment for a period of 20 months (until the expiration of the minimum term) and a period of three years and 10 months until the expiration of the additional term. 
     
      
       
      SORC Reports and Other Relevant Reports 
       
      
    39 In considering the present application, the Court is to have regard to reports on the Applicant made by SORC and other relevant reports: cl.7(1)(a), Schedule 1, 1999 Act. 
     
      
       
      SORC Report of 15 August 1997 
       
      
    40 The SORC report of 15 August 1997 discloses that the Applicant had a chequered history in custody, which related largely to his long-standing drug problem. 
     
      
    41 The Applicant was classified A2 on 25 October 1989 and placed in the Reception and Assessment Prison at Long Bay. On 6 December 1991, the Applicant was transferred to the Goulburn Correctional Centre and, at his request, placed in the Multi Purpose Unit at that Centre on 10 May 1992. At that time, the Unit provided a range of programs for inmates who had difficulty assimilating in the general prison population. However, the next day a search of the Applicant’s belongings revealed a syringe concealed in the handle of his electric jug and, as a result, he was removed from the Unit. 
     
      
    42 When seen by an Assessment Committee at Goulburn in May 1992, the Applicant was in the methadone program and was receiving drug and alcohol counselling. By November 1992, reports concerning the Applicant were not favourable, and he had been sacked recently from his employment as a painter. The Applicant said that his mother had been banned from visiting him because she had brought drugs into the prison. 
     
      
    43 Despite favourable reports by the drug and alcohol worker and the education officer in November 1993, the Applicant’s request for a reduction in classification and transfer to Berrima Correctional Centre was not supported by the Assessment Committee. 
     
      
    44 When seen by an Assessment Committee on 22 March 1994, the Applicant was reported to be unemployed and unwilling to work and his request for transfer to Berrima was not supported. 
     
      
    45 SORC reviewed the Applicant’s management on 31 March 1995 and resolved to seek a comprehensive assessment from the drug and alcohol worker at Goulburn. Reports revealed that the Applicant desired to remain drug free adding that “the methadone helps him achieve this”. It was recommended that the Applicant be classified B, to remain at Goulburn. It was considered that “a possible improvement in his psychological well being may result, benefiting his motivation to continue his educational pursuits” and that “such a result would reward his apparent compliant behaviour, encouraging a continuation of this pattern”. On 6 June 1995, it was determined that the Applicant remain at Goulburn with a reduced B classification. 
     
      
    46 In a report dated 4 December 1995, Dr Karl Koller, psychiatrist, noted that the Applicant was receiving methadone treatment and that “his progress here has been variable” and “at times he has ceased methadone only finding necessity to recommence”. 
     
      
    47 The Applicant was seen by an Assessment Committee at Goulburn on 4 December 1996 when his general behaviour was described as “just satisfactory” and his interest in employment as “minimal”. However, he was continuing with his art studies and was the subject of a favourable report from the education officer.  
     
      
    48 The SORC report of 15 August 1997, under the hand of the Chairperson, the Hon K Enderby QC, concluded with the following comments: 
     
      
       
        
        “Despite encouragement POLLOCK’s progress through the correctional system has been delayed because of his drug addiction, lack of motivation, and negative work attitude. 
        
       
       
        
        Nevertheless, he has maintained an interest in various forms of art work even though facilities in maximum security institutions for this form of study are limited. 
        
       
       
        
        It is to be hoped that continuing efforts by members of the Inmate Development Staff, together with the support and encouragement of the Serious Offenders Review Council, will result in an improvement in POLLOCK’s development to a point were  
        [sic] 
         he can be reduced progressively in classification and prepared ultimately to take his place in the community as a law abiding citizen.” 
        
       
       
      SORC Supplementary Report of 24 October 2006 
       
      
    49 The supplementary SORC report of 24 October 2006 noted that, since the initial SORC report, the Applicant had remained classified B at Goulburn. A category B classification is given to an inmate who, in the opinion of the Commissioner of Corrective Services, should at all times be confined by a secure physical barrier. 
     
      
    50 The Applicant had been convicted of three breaches of gaol discipline, comprising obstruction of a prison officer on 27 January 1998 (three days confined to cell), not complying with prison routine on 8 June 1998 (14 days off buy-ups) and not complying with directions of a prison officer on 12 August 2001 (reprimand and caution). 
     
      
    51 SORC considered that since its previous report, the Applicant’s custodial behaviour appeared to have improved. 
     
      
    52 Concerns were expressed about the Applicant in 2001 as he was not employed and was on a medical certificate from the clinic and spent most of the day in his cell after receipt of his daily methadone. He was enrolled in a computer course which he attended with good reports from the education officer. 
     
      
    53 A psychological report of 12 October 2006, written jointly by Ms Viviana Harjai and Ms Georgina Spilsbury, accompanied the supplementary SORC report. The Level of Service Inventory - Revised (LSI-R) was administered to the Applicant by Ms Harjai and Ms Spilsbury. The LSI-R is designed to assist in objectively assessing an offender’s level of risk of re-offending and to highlight areas of lifestyle, personal history, attitudes and behaviour most likely to contribute to that risk. The Applicant was found to be in the moderate-risk/needs group. The major areas of dynamic risk for the Applicant appeared to be in education/employment and drug and alcohol areas. The authors of the report expressed the following conclusion (Exhibit D, Annexure K, pages 5-6): 
     
      
       
        
        “It would appear that Mr Pollock's behaviour has improved in the more recent years of his incarceration. He has maintained an in-gaol record free of offences since 2001, with the last punishment comprising of a reprimand and caution. His last assault charge is dated March 1992. Unit reports also concur that he has improved. 
         
         
        Mr Pollock does appear, however, to be currently relying on a number of medications, and would seem to have done so for a prolonged period of time. Mr Pollock's long history of drug abuse would appear to continue to require addressing. It may be beneficial for him to reduce some of the opiate based medication (under careful monitoring by medical staff) so that he may be better able to participate and gain from future Alcohol and Other Drug treatment. It may also be useful for Mr Pollock to undergo investigations in order to clarify diagnosis of epilepsy and in turn clarify his medication needs. It is recommended that Mr Pollock be assessed by  
        [a]  
        psychiatrist and have his medications reviewed. 
         
         
        Were Mr Pollock to receive a determinate sentence he would likely benefit from a pathway of reducing such medication, and therefore increasing his focus and practice in coping with issues, and actively engaging in Alcohol and Other Drug treatment. While he is reducing this medication he may further benefit from learning skills to better deal with anxiety. It is also possible that some of his anxiety symptoms may be due to side-effects of his current medication regime. 
         
         
        Mr Pollock has spent the majority of his sentence in Goulburn and therefore may benefit by moving to another Centre where he may be motivated to begin focusing strongly on his treatment and preparation for future community living. A possibility may be a modern centre such as Mid North Coast where he would also benefit from closer proximity to his sister. 
         
         
        It is noted that Mr Pollock has some concerns in regards to being placed in a minimum security environment. However, a structured minimum environment may provide him with an opportunity to better adapt and work towards release. It may be appropriate for him to continue with Drug and Alcohol treatment in view of gaining entry into a program such as the Ngara Nura program, which would be available to him were he to reach a ‘C3’ classification. He has indicated an interest in this program. This could then complete a structured pathway towards release. Mr Pollock has further indicated that he would be happy to participate In a residential drug treatment program in the community, were he to be released.” 
        
       
      
    54 The supplementary SORC report, under the hand of the Chairperson, the Hon David Levine RFD QC, concluded with the following comments: 
     
      
       
        
        “To some extent the negative components referred to above have been tempered by POLLOCK’s pursuit of education, reduction in aggression and his having ‘calmed down’.  
        
       
       
        
        His medication dependence is a matter of concern and the Psychologist’s recommendation as to psychiatric investigation should be pursued. 
        
       
       
        
        The ‘structured pathway towards release’ referred to by the Psychologists is viewed by the Council as one that is not unrealistically beyond realisation.” 
        
       
       
      Reports of Dr Lucas 
       
      
    55 Dr Lucas interviewed the Applicant at Goulburn on 16 December 2003 and again on 12 January 2006. 
     
      
    56 In his first report dated 7 January 2004, Dr Lucas recounted the Applicant’s history, including his long history of injecting illicit drugs. He noted that the Applicant continued on the methadone program with a then current dose of 16 mls a day.  
     
      
    57 The Applicant told Dr Lucas that he had used cannabis since he was 12 or 13 years old. At 15, he started to use heroin and continued this usage between times in custody until 1998. He remarked to Dr Lucas that he had not had a full year out of custody at any one time since the age of 11.  
     
      
    58 With respect to drug usage in prison, Dr Lucas reported (Exhibit 2, report of 7 January 2004, pages 3-4): 
     
      
       
        
        “I asked about use of drugs in prison. He said in previous sentences and in the early part of the current one he did use drugs. About 1993 he was found to have concealed a syringe in a jug. 
         
          
         
        I asked if he would be able to remain off drugs if released from prison. He said, ‘If I could stay off in here I can out there’. It has been ‘quite a few years’ since he injected  
        [and] 
         drug and urine tests in prison have always been clear.” 
        
       
      
    59 The first report of Dr Lucas addressed the question of psychiatric diagnoses (page 10): 
     
      
       
        
        “Mr Pollock’s principal psychiatric diagnoses are panic attacks, perhaps panic disorder, currently controlled with medication and substance abuse. 
         
         
        His history of substance abuse goes back to his early teens and although he has tried a number of substances heroin by injection has been drug of choice. He has been on the methadone program for a decade or more and the dose is currently being reduced. He states he has been abstinent from drugs in prison for quite a number of years. 
         
         
        There are undoubtedly personality factors involved in his long history of offending but without independent information I hesitate to make a personality diagnosis. Persistent antisocial conduct of the type revealed by Mr Pollock’s criminal record, and his own account, does not imply an antisocial personality disorder. The influence of companions, drug use and socio-economic factors as well as early institutionalisation seem important.” 
        
       
      
    60 Dr Lucas concluded his first report with the following opinion (page 11): 
     
      
       
        
        “Mr Pollock has now served about fifteen years of his life sentence and is a B classification prisoner in Goulburn Correctional Centre. He is on the methadone program, sees a psychiatrist and takes an antidepressant and a benzodiazepine for both daytime sedation and as a hypnotic. He continues involvement in education and is not working. By his account there is good contact with his family and a probability of accommodation and support when he is released. After release he intends to pursue his education in art. He has no employment skills. Before the murder he had no convictions for violent offices  
        [sic] 
        . 
         
         
        In my opinion Mr Pollock is at the stage in his life sentence when determination of it would be of benefit to him and to those who will be involved in his further rehabilitation and preparation for release. Without some certainty about his minimum sentence I suspect that he will continue his prison career much as he has to date. He is quite institutionalised. With more certainty about his sentence consideration can be given to a reduction in classification, a broadening of his activities and an increase in contact with the outside community. 
         
         
        With regard, to his attitude to the offence, I thought his brief discussion with me fell somewhat short of complete denial of his involvement, there was a degree of acceptance of responsibility and some indication of regret about what occurred. Mr Pollock said he has tried to do his sentence the hard way, in a maximum security prison. I would be prepared to interview him again on this issue if you think it necessary. In any case, if there is concern about this it can be looked into by psychological staff while he undergoes further rehabilitation.” 
        
       
      
    61 The second report of Dr Lucas dated 14 February 2006 was prepared after his visit to interview the Applicant at Goulburn on 12 January 2006.  
     
      
    62 The Applicant informed Dr Lucas that his plans, if released, were to live with his 48-year old sister at Pottsville Beach, an hour away from the New South Wales - Queensland border. His sister agreed with this plan.  
     
      
    63 With respect to the Applicant’s drug use and health in custody, Dr Lucas stated (Exhibit 2, report of 14 February 2006, page 4): 
     
      
       
        
        “Mr Pollock has been on methadone for the last couple of years because he was running around with the wrong people. He nearly started drug use but chose methadone instead. His dose has been reduced. When in the community he was on a methadone program on and off. He was planning for his dose in prison to be reduced - it may have been increased around the time of his appeal. He has promised and  
        [sic]  
        his sister that he will not need methadone outside. 
         
         
        Mr Pollock suffers from epilepsy and is currently on an anticonvulsant, Neurontin. For about eight years he has had seizures now and then. He takes grand mal fits - others tell him he falls and then convulses. He has not had a seizure for a year. He was investigated by a scan at Goulburn Hospital. When he has had seizures he has been put in a dry cell until he settles. 
         
         
        Other medication is Prozac 20 mg a day for depression and panic attacks. The previous dose was 40 mg. For anxiety he takes the hypnotic Temazepam. He likes being on Prozac rather than being ‘slumped all day’. He plans to stay on it when released, At least for a while, and followed up by a psychiatrist. His sister will arrange this. 
         
         
        In prison he does not see a psychiatrist often.” 
        
       
      
    64 Dr Lucas summarised the Applicant’s diagnosis in the following way (page 7): 
     
      
       
        
        “As described in my previous report Mr Pollock's principal diagnoses are panic attacks, perhaps amounting to panic disorder, quite well-controlled with medication. There is a history of depression but medication has principally been aimed at controlling anxiety. 
         
         
        As well he has a history of substance abuse going back to his early teens with heroin by injection having been his drug of choice. Mr Pollock remains on the methadone program and aims to reduce the dose in the near future and not required on release from prison. 
         
         
        In my previous report I remarked that although there were undoubtedly personality factors involved in his long history of offending, I was hesitant to make a personality diagnosis. I thought that the influence of companions, drug use, socio-economic factors and early institutionalisation were important and that persistent antisocial conduct of the type suggested by his criminal record did not necessarily mean he was suffering antisocial personality disorder. 
         
         
        During his imprisonment Mr Pollock has required long term treatment with medication for depression, anxiety and panic attacks and he has for some years been on the methadone program.” 
        
       
      
    65 Dr Lucas concluded his report with the following opinion (page 8): 
     
      
       
        
        “Mr Pollock has had difficulty accepting he was capable of the crime for which he received his life sentence. He had complaints about the police and also about evidence given by prisoners. I suspect one of the problems is the nature of the offence and his assertion that he is not a violent person. This uncertainty in his attitude is something which I believe will have to be accepted. Weight should be given to the fact he has accepted his sentence, paid the price and, as he described to me previously, it made it hard for himself and done  
        [sic]  
        most of his sentence in Goulburn. Mr Pollock has had psychological difficulties throughout his imprisonment and required medication for depression, anxiety and panic attacks. To my knowledge, he has not been a difficult prisoner to manage. 
         
         
        In my opinion, Mr Pollock would benefit by having his sentence determined so that he can move to a C classification and begin a program aimed at preparing him for eventual release. He told me he would accept a C classification to the minimum security wing at Goulburn if this was offered. Given his long history of institutional life he will require preparation before release. His present post-release plans appear reasonable and he says he has the full support of his sister and can stay with her. When he returns to the community he will require supervision and support, psychiatric follow-up with a management program to minimise the chance of his reverting to drug use. 
         
         
        He is now forty and strongly motivated to avoid a return to prison but, as mentioned above, he will require support and treatment to maximise his opportunities and minimise the risk of his relapsing to drug use or re-offending. In my opinion the risk of a serious violent offence is probably low - he had no previous conviction for violence.” 
        
       
       
      Victim Impact Statement 
       
      
    66 As mentioned earlier, the Court received a victim impact statement of Kerryn Ryan, the sister of the deceased: s.28(2) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. Ms Ryan recounts, with eloquence and dignity, the impact upon her family of the sudden and senseless death of her brother on 9 May 1988. The death of her brother so long ago has left her with ongoing sadness and pain, and anger towards the Applicant. It is appropriate for a public acknowledgement to be made of the loss and grief suffered by Mr Ryan’s family.  
     
      
    67 It is, of course, the law of this State that a greater sentence cannot be passed because of the impact of the crime on the victim’s family: R v Previtera (1997) 94 A Crim R 76 at 84-87; R v Slater (2001) 121 A Crim R 369 at 374-375 [19]-[24]; R v FD and JD (2006) 160 A Crim R 392 at 415-416 [103]-[105], 428 [170]-[171]. 
     
      
       
      Submissions of the Applicant 
       
       
      Objective Seriousness of Offence 
       
      
    68 Ms Burgess submits that the present offence lay towards the lower range of objective seriousness for the crime of murder. It was submitted that this was a spontaneous and unpremeditated act of violence carried out by the Applicant, who had used heroin shortly before the incident. 
     
      
    69 It was submitted that there is insufficient evidence for the Court to be satisfied that, at the relevant time, the Applicant had the intention to kill. The case was left to the jury by Wood J on the basis that the Crown had to prove either intent to kill or intent to cause grievous bodily harm. It was noted that Wood J said that he was satisfied that the jury had found beyond reasonable doubt that the deceased’s skull fracture was sustained as he fell backwards down the stairs and that the pelvic fractures occurred when he landed on the ground below. His Honour found that the injuries to the liver and scrotum were caused by the Applicant kicking the deceased on a number of occasions, although there was evidence that the injuries to the victim’s genitals may have been caused by him falling from the railing whilst straddling it. Had the Applicant not kicked the deceased after he fell down the stairs, it was submitted that it would have been very difficult for the Crown to prove that he had the requisite intent for murder. It was the subsequent kicking of the deceased which was critical in this regard. It was noted that Wood J did not make any finding as to whether the Applicant had intent to kill or an intent to do grievous bodily harm, no doubt because his Honour had no option but to impose a sentence of life imprisonment.  
     
      
    70 Ms Burgess observed that, in the 1992 appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal, Gleeson CJ (at page 2) observed that the Applicant’s admissions were consistent with a conclusion that his conduct “to say the least” was done with the intent to cause grievous bodily harm.  
     
      
    71 It was submitted that the prison-informer witness, Mr X, gave evidence that, whilst the Applicant admitted punching and kicking the deceased, he kept on telling him “it was an accident”. The Applicant admitted in his record of interview with police that he had punched the deceased, but said nothing about his state of mind at the time (Q/A.32-35). The Applicant also admitted, when the victim was on the ground, “he was shaking like he was trying to get up” so he kept on kicking him (Q/A.32). It was submitted that the taking of money appeared to have been an afterthought (Q/A.32). Ms Burgess submitted that, at its highest, the evidence discloses intent to do grievous bodily harm and that the Court would not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the Applicant acted with intent to kill.  
     
      
    72 The Applicant relied upon a passage in the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Apps v R [2006] NSWCCA 290 where Simpson J (Whealy J agreeing) said at [49]: 
     
      
       
        
        “Certainly, in a case of murder, the state of mind in which the offence is committed is a relevant consideration going to objective seriousness. As is well known, murder may be established by proof of an act causing death committed when the act is accompanied by any one of three states of mind: in descending levels of seriousness they are: an intention to kill, an intention to cause grievous bodily harm, or reckless indifference. I have no doubt that an intention to kill as distinct from either of the two alternatives, is a consideration tending to greater objective seriousness rather than lesser. So much is obvious. Indeed, in  
        Way 
          
        [(2004) 60 NSWLR 168] 
        , while the Court expressly alluded to mental states, followed this by the parenthetical observation that ‘intention is more serious than recklessness’. However, of itself, an intention to kill alone cannot establish that a particular instance of the crime of murder is above the mid-range of seriousness. It is not the only circumstance relevant to that assessment. In this the submissions made on behalf of the applicant are correct.” 
        
       
      
    73 Although the present Applicant’s offence was committed long before the introduction of the standard non-parole period system, Ms Burgess submits that the above passage is apposite to a determination of the objective seriousness of the Applicant’s offence. 
     
      
    74 It was submitted for the Applicant that an assessment of the objective seriousness of the Applicant’s offence played an appropriate part in the present application where, if the Court determines to fix a determinate sentence, the term of that sentence will be affected by a finding concerning objective seriousness. 
     
      
       
      Reports of SORC and Dr Lucas 
       
      
    75 Ms Burgess pointed to features in the supplementary SORC report and accompanying documentation which indicated improvement in the Applicant’s custodial behaviour. Particular reference was made to a psychological report of Ms Harjai and Ms Spilsbury to which reference has already been made (at paragraph 53 above).  
     
      
    76 Counsel for the Applicant submitted that an appropriate course was to fix a determinate sentence to allow a structured pathway to release to be implemented, in the manner referred to in this report. 
     
      
    77 Ms Burgess emphasised that the reports of Dr Lucas pointed to available family support for the Applicant upon release. Dr Lucas was supportive of a reduction in classification, with a corresponding increased contact with the outside community, which would result from the fixing of a determinate sentence. Counsel submitted that the Court should accept Dr Lucas’ opinion that the risk of a serious violent offence occurring upon release is probably low, given the Applicant’s prior history (apart from the present offence). 
     
      
       
      Totality 
       
      
    78 Ms Burgess acknowledged that, if a sentence was to be determined, considerations of totality would arise in accordance with the principles in Mill v The Queen (1988) 166 CLR 59. In this regard, it was submitted that it was relevant that the Applicant had served over two years’ imprisonment by 20 November 1990 in relation to other offences, and that his non-parole period expired on 18 July 1992 and the fixed term on 25 May 1993.  
     
      
       
      The Need to Preserve the Safety of the Community and the Applicant’s Record for Other Offences 
       
      
    79 By reference to the statutory factor concerning the need to preserve the safety of the community (cl.7(1)(b), Schedule 1), Ms Burgess submitted that the evidence did not point to a history of violent conduct by the Applicant, apart from the present offence. It was submitted that the Applicant’s substantial history for crimes of dishonesty, did not bear, in any relevant respect, upon this factor. Ms Burgess submitted that the present offence may be classified as an uncharacteristic aberration against the background of a record of offending for dishonesty, and that this conclusion meant that the principles identified in Veen v The Queen (No. 2) (1987-1988) 164 CLR 465 at 477 had no application in this case.  
     
      
    80 It was submitted that the risk assessment carried out for the purpose of the psychological report of 12 October 2006, and the reports of Dr Lucas, lead to the conclusion that the risk of the Applicant committing a serious violent offence is probably low. 
     
      
       
      Practice of Release on Licence, Statistics and Comparable Cases 
       
      
    81 Ms Burgess advanced a submission by reference to cl.7(1)(d), Schedule 1 of the 1999 Act. It was acknowledged that this provision did not apply expressly to the Applicant’s case, as he was sentenced after 12 January 1990 and not before. Ms Burgess submitted, nevertheless, that it was appropriate for the Court to have regard to the practice of release on licence prior to 1990 as an “other relevant matter” within cl.7(1)(e), Schedule 1. 
     
      
    82 Ms Burgess submitted that s.13A(9)(a) Sentencing Act 1989 required a court, which had determined to set a minimum term and additional term under the section, to have regard to the knowledge of the original sentencing court that a person sentenced to imprisonment for life was eligible to be released on licence under s.463 Crimes Act 1900, and of the practice relating to the issue of such licences.  
     
      
    83 It was submitted that, as release on licence and practice relating to the issue of licences was a relevant matter to be taken into account on a redetermination at the time when the Applicant was sentenced, it would be unfair if he was disadvantaged by subsequent changes in the legislation. 
     
      
    84 Counsel referred to statistics calculated by the Department of Corrective Services concerning the mean length of time served before first release on licence by 161 life-sentence prisoners between October 1981 and October 1987 (11.7 years) and noted that, according to those statistics, 149 prisoners (92.5%) served 15 years or less. 
     
      
    85 Ms Burgess relied upon R v MJR (2002) 54 NSWLR 368 in support of the proposition that, on sentencing for an offence, it is proper for a court to take into account the sentencing practice as at the date of the commission of the offence, when sentencing practice has moved adversely to an offender. By reference to a publication of the Judicial Commission of New South Wales entitled “Sentenced Homicides in New South Wales 1990-1993” (Monograph Series No. 10, June 1995), it was submitted that, at the relevant time, a typical sentence for murder under s.19A Crimes Act 1900 might be described as a total sentence of 18 years’ imprisonment comprising a minimum term of 12 years and an additional term of six years (page 76). 
     
      
    86 Counsel relied upon a table of sentences redetermined under s.13A Sentencing Act 1999 where the offence of murder had involved an assault. It was submitted that a minimum term (or non-parole period) of 16 years is towards the top of the range. It was submitted that the Applicant has served some 16 years’ imprisonment solely referrable to this offence, and has been in custody for over 18 years. It was submitted that the Applicant has already served, or is very close to having served, an appropriate non-parole period.  
     
      
    87 Whilst it is apparent that the Applicant needs some preparation for his release, it was submitted that it was not appropriate to impose a sentence which is disproportionate to the objective gravity of the offence, simply to allow additional time for this to occur. Ms Burgess acknowledged that the setting of a non-parole period does not mean that the Applicant will be released. The State Parole Authority has a duty to ensure that all necessary and appropriate steps have been taken before this occurs. 
     
      
       
      Date of Commencement of Sentence 
       
      
    88 Ms Burgess acknowledges that, as the Applicant was in custody for other offences when he was charged with murder on 21 March 1989, any non-parole period must date from the time of the original sentence on 20 November 1990. 
     
      
       
      Submissions of the Crown 
       
      
    89 The Crown acknowledged that this was a case where it was appropriate for the Court to set a specified term for the sentence, together with a non-parole period: cl.4(1)(a), Schedule 1 of the 1999 Act. 
     
      
       
      Objective Seriousness of Offence 
       
      
    90 The Crown submitted that, although this is not a case which would be classified as being within the worst category of murder, it is a significantly serious matter which may be appropriately characterised as being at the middle of the range of objective seriousness for the crime of murder. 
     
      
    91 It was submitted that the Court ought conclude from the nature of the injuries sustained by the victim that this was a most vicious attack, and that the Applicant had acted with intent to kill. Even if the Court could not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the Applicant intended to kill the victim, it was clear that he had intended to cause grievous bodily harm. It was submitted that this was, nevertheless, a very serious and vicious attack on a young man carried out without any provocation. 
     
      
    92 The Court was referred to parts of the evidence of the Crown witnesses, Mr X and Mr Y, which, according to the Crown, emphasised the seriousness of the Applicant’s attack upon the deceased and the fact that it was carried out for no real reason. Although acknowledging that the evidence of the two prison-informer witnesses ought be approached with due caution, the Crown submitted that their evidence should nevertheless be taken into account. 
     
      
       
      Contrition 
       
      
    93 The Crown submitted that the Applicant had demonstrated no contrition for his crime. The matter had proceeded to trial and he had made continuing attempts, over the years, to have the conviction overturned by way of appeal or application under s.474D Crimes Act 1900, leading to a referral to the Court of Criminal Appeal in 2005. 
     
      
    94 The Crown pointed to statements made by the Applicant to Dr Lucas in his second report of 14 February 2006 in which the Applicant asserted that he was “not a man of violence” and had “never done a violent act” in his life. To the extent that Dr Lucas reported that the Applicant “accepted his sentence”, the Crown submitted that this was significantly different from the Applicant having accepted that he committed the crime.  
     
      
       
      The Applicant’s Prospects of Rehabilitation 
       
      
    95 The Crown submitted that a cautious approach was required with respect to the Applicant’s prospects of rehabilitation. Reference was made to the psychological report of 12 October 2006 which accompanied the supplementary SORC report (see paragraph 53 above). 
     
      
    96 The Crown acknowledged that there had been improvement in the Applicant’s custodial behaviour and attitude in recent years, but that a guarded approach was required given his long-term use of methadone, viewed against a long history of use of illicit injecting drugs prior to 1989.  
     
      
    97 The Crown acknowledged that the ultimate decision concerning release on parole lay with the State Parole Authority, and that the fixing of a non-parole period would not automatically see the release of the Applicant. Nevertheless, the Crown submitted that it was appropriate to be cautious concerning the Applicant’s prospects of rehabilitation and that this caution was relevant to the determination of sentence.  
     
      
       
      Practice of Release on Licence, Statistics and Comparable Cases 
       
      
    98 With respect to the Applicant’s reliance upon release on licence practice prior to 1990, the Crown referred to the decision in R v Rees (Court of Criminal Appeal, 22 September 1995, unreported, BC9505405), where Gleeson CJ (Grove and Simpson JJ agreeing), at page 7, observed that release on licence is not the same thing as release on parole, and that it is eligibility for release on parole that is affected by the setting of a minimum term. Gleeson CJ observed that licences were often subject to stringent conditions and were revocable. The Crown submitted before me that caution is required in considering a submission which invites reference to statistical material concerning sentencing practice, including release on licence, before 1990.  
     
      
    99 The Crown submitted that cl.7(1)(d), Schedule 1 had no application here as the Applicant was sentenced after 12 January 1990. It was submitted that it would be erroneous to have regard under cl.7(1)(e), Schedule 1 to release on licence as “any other relevant matter” where the immediately preceding subclause had confined attention to that factor to sentences imposed before 12 January 1990 only. The Crown submitted, in substance, that cl.7(1)(d), Schedule 1 covers the field on that issue in the clause. 
     
      
       
      Totality 
       
      
    100 With respect to totality, the Crown submitted that Wood J had been somewhat generous towards the Applicant in choosing the commencement date for sentence given that the Applicant still had a significant period to serve for the sentences imposed in the District Court. As a result, there was a substantial period of concurrency between the sentences.  
     
      
       
      Determination 
       
      
    101 It is, of course, a matter for the Court to determine whether the application may be disposed of by setting a specified term for the sentence together with a non-parole period: cl.4(1)(a), Schedule 1. However, the Crown’s submission that this is an appropriate case for such a determination assists the Court in the resolution of the application. I am satisfied that the Crown’s concession is an appropriate and realistic one in the circumstances of this case.  
     
      
       
      Circumstances Surrounding the Offence 
       
      
    102 The Court is required to have regard on the application to all of the circumstances surrounding the offence for which the sentence was imposed: cl.3(1)(a), Schedule 1. 
     
      
    103 I have had regard to the submissions concerning the appropriate finding to be made, beyond reasonable doubt, with respect to the Applicant’s intention at the time of the crime. It is clear, on the evidence, that a vicious and sustained attack was perpetrated by him on the deceased. It is apparent that the jury was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt, for understandable reasons, that the Applicant intended to cause, at the least, grievous bodily harm to the deceased. Wood J, as the trial Judge, did not make a finding that he was satisfied that the Applicant had acted with intent to kill. It falls to me to consider this question on the evidence adduced at trial. 
     
      
    104 I have had regard to the medical evidence, together with the admissions made by the Applicant principally to police in the record of interview, but also, on a more guarded basis, to the admissions made to Mr X and Mr Y. Having regard to the totality of the evidence, I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the Applicant acted with intent to kill. I am satisfied that the Applicant acted with intent to cause grievous bodily harm. 
     
      
    105 I acknowledge the statement in Apps v R at [49] that an intention to kill, as distinct from an intention to cause grievous bodily harm, is a consideration tending to greater objective seriousness. However, although it will generally be the case that an intention to cause grievous bodily harm is less culpable to a greater or lesser degree than an intention to kill, this is not always the case. There are circumstances where an intention to inflict grievous bodily harm could reflect similar criminality to other cases involving an intention to kill: R v Hillsley (2006) 164 A Crim R 252 at 258 [16]-[17]. There is no prima facie presumption that murder resulting from reckless indifference to human life is less culpable than murder involving one of the other categories of intent referred to in the definition of murder: R v Ainsworth (1994) 76 A Crim R 127 at 139; R v Towner [2002] NSWSC 951 at [37]. 
     
      
    106 This was a savage attack perpetrated for no good reason by the Applicant on the deceased, accompanied by an intention to cause grievous bodily harm. In my view, the circumstances of this case reflect substantial criminality on the Applicant’s part, not far below criminality involving an intention to kill. 
     
      
    107 I do not accept the Applicant’s submission that this offence lies towards the lower end of the range of objective seriousness. I am satisfied that the offence may be placed above that point, but below the middle of the range of objective seriousness for this offence. In using this formula, I am conscious that the standard non-parole provisions have no application to this case. Nevertheless, the identification of the objective seriousness of the offence assists an assessment of the Applicant’s criminality revealed by this offence. 
     
      
       
      The Applicant’s Other Offences 
       
      
    108 The Court is required to have regard to all offences, wherever and whenever committed, of which the Applicant has been convicted: cl.3(1)(b), Schedule 1. 
     
      
    109 Prior to 1989, the Applicant had an extensive criminal history for offences of dishonesty which were clearly related to his long-term use of illicit injecting drugs. However, the Applicant had no record for offences of violence before the present offence. 
     
      
    110 His record for gaol discipline offences since 1989 does not reveal any significant history of violent incidents. Further, his custodial disciplinary history has shown significant improvement in the past decade. 
     
      
       
      SORC Reports and Other Relevant Reports Concerning the Applicant 
       
      
    111 The Court is required to have regard to SORC reports and any other relevant reports prepared after the Applicant was sentenced that are available to the Court: cl.7(1)(a), Schedule 1. 
     
      
    112 The initial SORC report of 1997 (see paragraphs 40 to 48 above) contained a guarded assessment concerning the Applicant’s progress in custody and his prospects of rehabilitation. His ongoing therapeutic use of methadone in custody, together with other areas of unsatisfactory progress, posed some difficulties for the Applicant. 
     
      
    113 The supplementary SORC report of 2006 (see paragraphs 49 to 54 above) points to a more satisfactory history of the Applicant in custody including improved prospects of rehabilitation if granted release. Given his continuing therapeutic use of methadone in custody, caution remains appropriate in this respect. Nevertheless, a more positive picture emerges from the supplementary report than its predecessor prepared some nine years before. 
     
      
    114 The psychological report of 12 October 2006 (see paragraph 53 above) provides some assistance to the Applicant’s case, but also indicates difficulties which he will confront upon release. These difficulties again lie in his capacity to live outside prison without use of illicit drugs or further breach of the criminal law, in particular with respect to offences of dishonesty. Nevertheless, the psychological report, on balance, points to a structured pathway towards the Applicant’s release and a framework in the community, including family support, which would promote the prospects of a law-abiding life by the Applicant. 
     
      
    115 The reports of Dr Lucas provide guarded support for the Applicant’s release to the community. I note Dr Lucas’ opinion that the risk of a further serious violent offence being committed by the Applicant is probably low.  
     
      
    116 The contents of the various reports support the setting of a specified term for the sentence, together with a non-parole period for the Applicant. 
     
      
       
      The Need to Preserve the Safety of the Community 
       
      
    117 The Court should have regard to the need to preserve the safety of the community in considering the present application: cl.7(1)(b), Schedule 1. 
     
      
    118 The Applicant has an extensive history of dishonesty offences prior to 1989, clearly linked to his use of illicit drugs. However, he has no prior history of offences of violence. His last assault charge in custody was in March 1992. Having regard to the Applicant’s history, Dr Lucas considered that the risk of the Applicant committing a serious offence of violence is probably low. 
     
      
    119 Having regard to the Applicant’s history, the greater risk appears to be that he will commit offences involving the use of illicit drugs, and associated offences of dishonesty, upon release.  
     
      
    120 On the evidence, I accept, however, that the risk of the Applicant committing a further serious offence of violence appears low. 
     
      
       
      The Age of the Applicant 
       
      
    121 The Court is required to have regard to the age of the Applicant at the time of the offence and at the time of the present application: cl.7(1)(c), Schedule 1. 
     
      
    122 The Applicant was born on 2 October 1965 and was 22 years old at the time of the offence on 9 May 1988. He has been in custody continuously since 5 October 1988. The Applicant is now aged 41 years. 
     
      
    123 It is apparent, as already observed, that the Applicant had a significant criminal history for offences of dishonesty, which were drug related, from the time he was 11 years old until his present incarceration at the age of 23 years. He spent a significant period of time in custody over the 12-year period between 1976 and 1988, before his present incarceration which has now occupied in excess of 18 years. 
     
      
    124 The present offence was committed when the Applicant was a young man. He is now approaching middle age. A significant test for the Applicant will be his ability to live a law-abiding and drug-free life upon release. 
     
      
       
      Practice of Release on Licence, Statistics and Comparable Cases 
       
      
    125 It is clear that cl.7(1)(d), Schedule 1 has no application to the present application. Do the factors referred to expressly in that subclause (which do not apply here) arise for considerations by means of the catch-all provision permitting reference to “any other relevant matter” in cl.7(1)(e), Schedule 1? 
     
      
    126 I have difficulty with Ms Burgess’ submission to this effect, as a matter of statutory construction. An express reference to the particular topic in cl.7(1)(d) tends to suggest that the same subject matter cannot be considered, by a different and broader route, under cl.7(1)(e). I accept the Crown’s submission in this respect. 
     
      
    127 I note in passing that in R v Lagopodis [2000] NSWSC 1201, Sully J observed at [24] that cl.7(1)(d), Schedule 1 applied only in the case of an applicant sentenced before 12 January 1990 and that the applicant there (like the present Applicant) had been sentenced after that date (on 7 September 1990). No issue arose in that case as to whether the former practice of release on licence could, in some other way, be taken into account on the application. 
     
      
    128 I do not consider that R v MJR assists the Applicant. The Applicant was sentenced to life imprisonment under a statutory scheme where it was open to him, after a specified period, to seek the fixing of a determinate head sentence and non-parole period. The principles in R v MJR have no application to the decision which I must make. 
     
      
    129 Even if the material concerning release on licence practice was relevant, I do not consider that the material relied upon provides particular assistance to the Applicant. The caution expressed by Gleeson CJ in R v Rees concerning reliance upon release on licence material, for the purpose of determining a non-parole period, is apposite to the present case. 
     
      
    130 I do not derive any particular assistance from the schedule of cases in which life sentences were redetermined under s.13A for murder involving assault. Limited factual information is provided in the schedule and care must be taken before drawing conclusions concerning a possible range of sentences. I did access the actual judgment in a number of the cases included in the schedule. Having done so, I remain of the view that they provide limited assistance in determining an appropriate non-parole period and total sentence in the particular circumstances of this case. 
     
      
       
       
      Contrition 
       
      
    131 I accept the submission of the Crown that the Applicant has not demonstrated contrition with respect to this offence. It was submitted by Ms Burgess that the Applicant had accepted the end of the legal process and accepts his punishment. It might be said, given the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in 2005, that the Applicant had little alternative but to accept the end of the legal process. 
     
      
    132 The existence of contrition or remorse is relevant to an assessment of an offender’s prospects of rehabilitation and the likelihood of him committing further offences in the future: R v MAK and MSK [2006] NSWCCA 381 at [41]. I have referred to other features of the evidence before the Court which bear upon the Applicant’s prospects of rehabilitation and the prospect of him committing further offences. This Court has observed that the absence of contrition cannot of itself defeat an application for redetermination of a life sentence: R v Plevac [2004] NSWSC 916 at [49].  
     
      
       
      Totality 
       
      
    133 It is clear that the totality principle applies to re-sentencing on a life sentence redetermination application: R v Salameh [1999] NSWCCA 300 at [30]. In this case, it was the District Court which sentenced the Applicant in 1989 and 1990 to lengthy terms of imprisonment for break, enter and steal offences. I have no information concerning those offences beyond that contained in the Applicant’s criminal history. 
     
      
    134 The issue here is the extent to which any determinate sentence which I fix for the offence of murder will run concurrently with pre-existing sentences of imprisonment imposed by another Court for serious offences of a different type. 
     
      
    135 It was common ground before me that any determinate sentence which I fix ought commence on 20 November 1990. Accordingly, it is appropriate to have regard to the significant period of concurrency during which the Applicant’s sentence for murder ran together with his sentences imposed in the District Court.  
     
      
    136 As the determinate sentence for murder which I fix must be backdated to 20 November 1990, I ought not disregard these other sentences as otherwise the Applicant would, in effect, only be punished (after 20 November 1990) for the murder and not the other offences: R v Purdey (1993) 31 NSWLR 668 at 680; R v Salameh at [30]-[36]; R v Maiden [2000] NSWCCA 519 at [21]ff. 
     
      
    137 In my view, it is appropriate to treat that part of the Applicant’s incarceration up to July 1992 as being referrable essentially to his District Court sentences. To approach the matter otherwise would see the Applicant serving no significant identifiable sentences for serious offences of dishonesty committed by him against the background of a long history of offences of dishonesty at that time. The magnitude of the sentences imposed in the District Court in 1989 and 1990 reflect the gravity of the criminality involved in those offences. 
     
      
       
      The Appropriate Sentence 
       
      
    138 Courts have observed that a Judge, on a redetermination application, has the advantage of hindsight when approaching the question of sentence: R v Malcolm (1991) 58 A Crim R 148 at 150, R v Page [2002] NSWSC 1067 at [69]. This is an advantageous position where information about, and professional observations of, the offender are much more extensive given the passage of years since imposition of the original sentence: R v Towner at [57]. 
     
      
    139 In setting a non-parole period, I recognise that I am setting a period at the expiration of which the Applicant will merely be eligible to be released, but will not necessarily be released. It will be a matter for the State Parole Authority to consider whether it is satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that the release of the Applicant on parole is appropriate in the public interest: s.135(1) Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act 1999. 
     
      
    140 In setting a non-parole period, I am required to set a period which I consider to be the minimum term that justice requires that the Applicant should serve in prison having regard to all the circumstances of the offence: Power v The Queen (1974) 131 CLR 623 at 628; The Queen v Bugmy (1990) 169 CLR 525 at 536; R v Simpson (2001) 53 NSWLR 704 at 716-717. 
     
      
    141 Having regard to the various matters to which reference has been made in this judgment, I have determined that it is appropriate to set a specified term for a sentence, together with a non-parole period for the sentence under cl.4(1)(a), Schedule 1 of the 1999 Act. 
     
      
    142 I set a specified term for the sentence of 24 years’ imprisonment commencing on 20 November 1990 and expiring on 19 November 2014 with a non-parole period of 17 years and nine months commencing on 20 November 1990 and expiring on 19 August 2008. I specify 19 August 2008 is the earliest date upon which the Applicant will be eligible for release on parole.

    JUDGMENT1. This is an appeal by Mr Uch from a sentence imposed upon him by a Magistrate. The appeal is brought pursuant to s 11 of the Crimes (Local Courts) Appeal and Review Act 2001. 2. Mr Uch pleaded guilty to driving whilst disqualified on 7 September 2006, that was the date of the offence. On 25 October 2006 Magistrate O’Connor at the Campbelltown Local Court convicted Mr Uch, sentenced him to six months imprisonment but suspended that sentence and disqualified him from driving for a period of two years from 25 November 2006 and ordered him to pay court costs. The appeal is against the severity of the sentence. 
    3. Briefly the facts, which are not in dispute are that Mr Uch on 7 September 2006 was pulled over by a random breath testing police unit. When asked to produce his licence it became apparent that he had been disqualified from 26 May 2006 until 26 November 2006. Mr Grogin frankly acknowledges that the purpose of the appeal is to challenge, so to speak, the suspended sentence rather than the disqualification. He points out from the bar table that his client responded to a call of distress from some friends and then decided to take the car out on that night to assist them.  
    4. He was born in Thailand and his parents came to this country. His father has since left the family and Mr Uch has little or no contact with him. He left school in year ten and joined the workforce and has been employed ever since apart from three months. His mother has a medical condition which is the subject of a medical certificate which has been tendered before me. Mr Uch is very much committed to caring for and assisting his mother in her illness. In addition he is, with his sister, paying off the mortgage to the house occupied by the family.  
    5. Mr Grogin points out that for a twenty one year old he has a great responsibility: financial, his ill mother and being in a position of, in a sense, being one of the principal members of the household. He works six days a week. He has commenced the Traffic Offenders Program and is apparently in his fifth week of that program. 
    6. He pleaded guilty on the first occasion. Mr Grogin indicated to me from the bar table that his client said that he wished he had seen or been confronted by what he had seen in the Driving Offender Program before now. He has not driven since his conviction and his car has been taken over by his sister and because he cannot drive and because of the position he has in the family, the fact that he cannot drive has had a significant impact on him.  
    7. There are two character references which I have read and at least one of them points to Mr Uch showing a lot of responsibility, integrity and ambition. That person also says how much Mr Uch has learned from the Traffic Offenders Program.  
    8. One problem with Mr Uch’s case is his criminal record or rather his traffic record I should say. He received his learner and provisional licences in 2001 and 2002 respectively. In 2003, on no fewer than three occasions, he was issued with a traffic infringement notice because of not complying with conditions of his licence. He has been convicted at least twice, perhaps three times, of exceeding the speed limit. 
    9. Significantly, on 31 May 2006 he was convicted at the Campbelltown Local Court of driving with middle range of concentration of alcohol and was disqualified from driving for a year. He appealed that conviction, a fine was substituted or rather the fine was reduced and the disqualification reduced for six months. I do observe that appeal was heard on 20 June 2006. It is a little surprising that within three months after that, namely on 7 September 2006, he was driving in the circumstances which resulted in this conviction. 
    10. Mr Grogin suggests that a bond under s 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 is a more appropriate sentence for this kind of offence. Ms Hallett, who appears for the Crown, frankly acknowledges that that is a contention which is not in contention so far as the Crown is concerned.  
    11. I have decided to accept the submission of Mr Grogin. I regard Mr Uch’s traffic record with some seriousness. It is not a good record for a young man. He has infringed the traffic code in minor but significant ways. Early in the piece he showed some disregard for the conditions of his licence. He has exceeded the speed limit a number of times and he has one significant conviction for mid range PCA. This is not at all a good start. However, I think that the best course at this stage, in addition to the period of disqualification which follows as a matter of statutory course, is to impose upon him a bond so that he is in a position to complete the course that he has undertaken. 
    12. I take into account the impact which the course has had on him which has been conveyed to me through his counsel and which is confirmed by one of his referees. I am hopeful that this is a case were a young man’s attitude to driving may be changed by the course and the opportunity - yet another opportunity afforded to him by the court will this time - will be taken most seriously.  
    13. Accordingly, in respect of this appeal against sentence I set aside the sentence of the learned Magistrate. Instead of the sentence imposed by the learned Magistrate I make an order directing Mr Uch to enter into a good behaviour bond for a period of 12 months and that good behaviour bond is subject to the usual statutory or regulatory conditions and in this case an additional condition that Mr Uch should complete the Driver Education Course which he has commenced. 
     Just pausing there, Mr Grogin, you suggested Probation and Parole supervision?GROGIN: Your Honour, I certainly don’t think that is something which would do him any harm. It’s a matter for the court.HIS HONOUR: And I direct that he - now what is the order I make, how does one--GROGIN: To accept any supervision of probation and parole for a period deemed necessary by that service.14. And I direct as a condition of the bond that Mr Uch accept any supervision from the Probation and Parole Service which is deemed appropriate by that service.GROGIN: Mr Uch to attend the probation and parole office within a period of seven days from today.15. For that purpose, he should attend the probation and parole office at Campbelltown within seven days of today. Now the disqualification which stays in place, I need to mention that. Am I right in thinking that is a statutory consequence of his conviction? 
    GROGIN: Yes your Honour. It’s an automatic period.16. I confirm the automatic period of disqualification for two years from 25 November 2006 and I confirm the court costs order made by the Magistrate. Anything else Mr Grogin? Miss Hallett? 
    HALLETT: No your Honour.GROGIN: Would it be of any assistance if I - would your Honour get any assistance if I were to forward to your Honour’s chambers some details about the Traffic Offenders Program?HIS HONOUR: I’m sure it would be, thank you. Thanks Mr Grogin.

      JUDGMENT 
       
       
       
      HER HONOUR: 
       
       
      Background 
       
      
    1 Mr Selim was arraigned before me on 21 February 2007 in respect of an indictment containing two alternate counts laid contrary to s 39 of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) and 11.1 and 11.3 of the Criminal Code (Cth). 
     
      
    2 In summary, the first count alleges that on or about 30 January 2003 Mr Selim procured Karl Brooks to destroy or to render illegible or undecipherable evidence, in the form of computer data on a nominated Pan Pharmaceuticals Limited computer, knowing that the data may be required as evidence in a judicial proceeding. The second count alleges that on the same date Mr Selim procured Mr Brooks to attempt to achieve the same objective. 
     
      
    3 The data the subject of both counts was original data from the testing of a medication known as Travacalm. This data was sought by the auditors of the Therapeutic Goods Administration (“the TGA“). As at 30 January 2003 Mr Selim was the Chief Executive Officer of Pan Pharmaceuticals Limited (now in liquidation) and Mr Brooks was employed by that company as the Information Technology Manager.  
     
      
    4 By Notices of Motion filed on 13 February 2007 Mr Selim seeks an order that the proceedings be temporarily stayed and, irrespective of whether that relief is granted, an order that the trial be permanently stayed.  
     
      
    5 Were a trial to proceed before me it would the third trial of Mr Selim in respect of the same allegations. The trial is listed in this Court following a successful application being made by the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions to the Chief Justice of this Court the effect of which was to transfer the proceedings from the District Court to this Court. This occurred before the second retrial was listed for hearing in the District Court.  
     
      
      The order in which the Motions for relief should be heard 
      
    6 The Notices of Motion seeking in turn a temporary stay and a permanent stay were filed at the same time, namely 13 February 2007, and have been heard together. The evidence relied upon by the applicant consists of a lengthy affidavit from Mr Thorpe and 23 documentary exhibits. The affidavit was filed on 19 February 2007, the day listed for the trial of Mr Selim before me. Mr Robberds QC, who appears with Mr Bromwich for the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions as respondent to the Motions, sought and was granted the opportunity to file evidence in reply. In the result, a lengthy affidavit and two lever arch volumes of annexures was sworn by Ms Lehn, a solicitor employed by the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions. This affidavit was filed on 20 February 2007. Ms Lehn has had carriage of the matter from early 2003. 
     
      
    7 Each of both Mr Thorpe and Ms Lehn have given evidence and been cross-examined. In addition, both parties have tendered evidence in the course of the hearing of the application to supplement the evidence filed and called in the proceedings. By agreement I have had tendered before me the transcript of the committal proceedings, and the transcript of evidence of the first and second trials, the former inclusive of counsels’ closing addresses and the latter the Crown’s opening address.  
     
      
    8 I have had regard to the affidavit evidence and the oral evidence in its entirety and those parts of the transcript of the earlier proceedings to which my attention has been drawn.  
     
      
    9 Early in the course of argument I expressed the view that the question of whether the applicant should be required to stand trial at all on the indictment in respect of which he has been arraigned should be determined in advance of whether the indictment ought be stayed on condition that the costs of some or all of the previous proceedings are paid. On one view, were I to be satisfied that Mr Selim should not be tried at all, no question would arise as to whether the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions should pay reasonable costs before it will be permitted to proceed to trial against him a third time. 
     
      
    10 On the applicant’s behalf however, Mr Byrne SC submitted that I should first resolve the question of whether a temporary stay should be granted since this relief is sought to remedy past unfairness and that the applicant is entitled to have that question resolved before the Crown should be permitted to bring the case to trial. He submits that it is only after resolution of that question that there is any need for the Court to address the further question as to whether there is demonstrated such incurable unfairness in any trial that might proceed before me that the Crown should being prevented from trying Mr Selim altogether. Mr Byrne SC submits that the focus of the enquiry into whether a temporary stay should be granted is retrospective while the question as to whether permanent stay should be granted is prospective or predictive.  
     
      
    11 While I see some force in this submission, based as it is on the different considerations that apply, or might apply, to the determination of whether a temporary stay ought be granted as distinct from the separate question of whether the trial should be stayed permanently, it is not a matter upon which I need to express any concluded view in order to resolve the substantive questions raised on the application.  
     
      
    12 I advised the parties before calling on Mr Robberds QC to respond to the applicant’s submissions that I was not persuaded that grounds for a permanent stay had been made out. I indicated then that I would give reasons for that decision when publishing my judgment.  
     
      
      The Order for a Permanent Stay  
      
    13 The grounds upon which it is said that the trial should be permanently stayed are particularised in the Notice of Motion, namely “the persistent failure on the part of the prosecution to discharge its obligation to disclose relevant material to the defence”. Mr Byrne has developed this ground further in submissions.  
     
      
    14 The burden of establishing irredeemable unfairness so as to preclude a fair trial rests on the applicant and the onus in establishing it is a heavy one: R v Petroulias (2005) 62 NSWLR 663 at 688 [103-104]. I also proceed on the basis of long established principle which emphasise that the grant of a permanent stay is a wholly exceptional remedy Jago v The District Court of NSW (1989) 168 CLR 23 Per Mason CJ at 31, Brennan J at 46-47, Dean J at 56, Toohey J at 71, Gaudron J at 74-75; that it must be used sparingly and with the utmost caution; Jago v The District Court of NSW per Gaudron J at 76; and should be ordered only in an extreme case Jago v The District Court of NSW Mason CJ at 34. It has also been emphasised that it must only be granted where the applicant establishes that the claimed for unfairness cannot be remedied by other measures at the Court’s disposal: Jago v The District Court of NSW per Mason CJ at 34 and Gaudron J at 75 and further, where it can be demonstrated that the Court’s processes being utilised to try those charged with criminal offences will be abused if they are engaged for that purpose, such as to outweigh the legitimate public interest in bringing those charged with criminal offences before a court to enable the question of guilt to be tried in accordance with due process R v WRC (2003) 59 NSWLR 273 at 282 [para 51-56]. 
     
      
    15 It is not submitted that there is any abuse of process by the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions seeking to have Mr Selim stand trial a third time per se, or that the past unfairness he complains of, of itself, renders any further trial unfair. Neither is it submitted that the manner in which the re-trial is to be conducted before me is productive of abuse in the sense that with the passage of time evidence has been lost or is otherwise not available, or witnesses are compromised in their ability to recall and give evidence of relevant events R v Reeves (1994) 122 ACTR 1. 
     
      
      The Grounds for a Permanent Stay 
      
    16 What is submitted on the applicant’s behalf is that I should be satisfied, in all the circumstances, that it would an abuse of the court’s process to have Mr Selim stand trial in this Court where the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions and /or the prosecuting authorities have breached their duty to make full disclosure to the defence in the past. It is said that this reveals that they must lack an appreciation of the nature and extent of their duty and that this, in turn, exposes the applicant to the risk that they will breach their duty to his detriment in the future. It is further submitted that Ms Lehn’s evidence on this application, and evidence the principal investigator Mr Irwin has given in each of the earlier trial proceedings, is such that I could not be satisfied that either they have made proper or adequate disclosure even at this time, that they will not do so in the future, or that there is a risk that they will not.  
     
      
    17 In so far as the evidence of Ms Lynn is concerned, I am also asked to find that she has an appreciable lack of understanding of the issues in the trial such as to make it unlikely that there will be in the future (or even that there has been to date) full disclosure of material relevant to those issues. 18 So far as the evidence of Mr Irwin is concerned, I am asked to find that because he has deliberately concealed relevant evidence about the process by which he took a statement from Mr Brooks in July 2003, and that he has given untruthful evidence on oath about it, I could not be confident that he has to date, or will in the future, produce material to which the defence are entitled. I am also to find that Mr Brooks has colluded with Mr Irwin in concealing the truth about the process by which he gave his first statement to the TGA and that he has given at best a disingenuous account under oath on the subject in the committal proceedings, and at worst that he has also deliberately lied. 19 While the facts before the Supreme Court of South Australia in Ulman- Naruniec 143 A Crim R 531 bear no direct relationship to the facts in this case, I share the views expressed by Belby J at 47 where he says ….. 
     
      
       
        
        “If there had been a finding of deliberate withholding of information in order to frustrate the proper defence of the prosecution or a finding that prosecution witnesses had previously lied on oath, then absent further explanation, an inference might properly be drawn that those involved might continue to attempt to frustrate the due process of the administration of justice, such that one could not be sure that further relevant information would not be withheld. If that were the situation, or if there was any hint of the existence of further relevant information being withheld, justice would demand a stay of proceedings, at least until the Court could be satisfied, if it could be, that no more information was being withheld.” 
        
       
       
      His Honour went on to say: 
       
       
        
        “It is well recognised that our system of justice reposes a great deal of responsibility and trust in prosecuting authorities, and requires the utmost integrity of them in the faithful discharge of their responsibilities….If courts and accused persons cannot proceed on the assumption that those responsibilities will be properly discharged, then the criminal adversarial system as we know it cannot survive. In the absence of evidence that there is a continuing failure to discharge those responsibilities the court must assume they will be properly discharged.”  
        
       
      
    20 Given the seriousness of the allegation that there has been a deliberate withholding of evidence by Mr Irwin and Mr Brooks, and the submission that Ms Lehn has such an inadequate appreciation of her duties as a prosecutor and such an inadequate understanding of the issues in the trial, that she has breached her duty of disclosure, it is necessary that I determine these questions at the outset. While that these findings will have a bearing on whether I should grant a temporary stay they will not dictate whether that should be the result. On the other hand, these findings have a direct bearing on whether a permanent stay should be ordered.  
     
      
      Has Ms Lehn Breached her Duty of Disclosure? 
      
    21 I will deal with the complaint directed at Ms Lehn first. As I noted earlier Ms Lehn has sworn an affidavit in the proceedings. This affidavit could only be described as detailed and comprehensive. Exhibited to that affidavit are two volumes of material. I have also had the benefit of seeing and hearing Ms Lehn give evidence. On the basis of what Ms Lehn has deposed to in her affidavit, and the evidence she has given under cross examination, I am left in no doubt that she has endeavoured at all times to discharge her duties as a prosecutor in accordance with the Director’s published guidelines and in full appreciation of her duty to make available to the defence materials that she considers may be relevant in the proceedings. I am confident that conscious of her duty in this regard she has made from time to time a sensible appraisal of material in her possession or material otherwise available to her. 22 When I consider the way in which the authorities have held the duty of disclosure should be understood, and the way in which compliance with it might be tested, I am confident that Ms Lehn has acted responsibly and with due diligence in her carriage of this matter to date, such that I can safely proceed on the assumption that she will continue to act in the same manner in the forthcoming proceedings. 23 As a prosecutor she is not obliged to anticipate a defence case and is not fixed at law with perfect prescience such as to impose on her a duty to foresee what may emerge as an issue in the unfolding of the criminal process (see R v Glover (1987) SASR 310 at 314). 24 The test of what the prosecution is required to disclose is set out in R v Spitiri (2004) 61 NSWLR 369: 
     
      
       
        
        I would judge to be material in the realm of disclosure that which can be seen on a sensible appraisal by the prosecution: 
         
        (1) to be relevant or possibly relevant to an issue in the case; 
         
        (2) to raise or possibly raise a new issue whose existence is not apparent from the evidence the prosecution proposes to use; 
         
        (3) to hold out a real (as opposed to fanciful) prospect of providing a lead on evidence which goes to (1) or (2). 
        
       
       
      (See [17] and [20] where Justice Simpson stated that she agreed that that test correctly encapsulates, for New South Wales, the prosecution’s duty of disclosure. Justices Grove and Shaw agreed with Justice Simpson.) 
      
    25 Because my focus at this time is on whether Ms Lehn knew and appreciated at the time of the committal, and thereafter, the way in which her duty of disclosure should be discharged to the Court, I leave to one side whether or not with the perfect sight that hindsight brings, she would have produced the material complained of earlier if she had recalled she had it, or whether she would have sought out earlier than 17 November 2006 additional material held by third parties if she had believed they were in possession of it. Whether she would have or not is not to the point given that the time at which the question of whether or not she has breached her duty of disclosure is when the material is at hand, or at her disposal, such that she can make a sensible appraisal of it.26 I note that at the time the brief of evidence was served on 3 November 2004 it comprised 24 volumes of evidence and, I emphasise, 3 volumes of disclosure materials (see paragraph 16 Ms Lehn’s affidavit). I also note and accept as true that after the first trial there was some complaint about non-disclosure resultant from the production of a document which has come to be referred to in the proceedings as MFI 21 (statement to Blakes’ of 19 November 2003). As a result of this complaint Ms Lehn reviewed correspondence and other documents held by the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions in August/September 2006 to ensure that everything that should have been disclosed had been disclosed. I also note that since that time other materials have been produced as they either came into Ms Lehn’s possession or as she became aware of their existence, or possible existence, in the possession of third parties. In this context, I refer to the contentious statement she sought from Blake Dawson Waldron on 17 November 2006 in the course of the second trial and the compendious sets of materials she has obtained from them and served on the defence since that time (Annexures AY and AZ to Ms Lehn’s affidavit). I also note that a folder of statements, noted up by Ms Lehn in the pre-committal phase, were served on 18 February 2007. 27 Against this background, I have every confidence that Ms Lehn has faithfully discharged her duty of disclosure to the best of her ability and that she will continue to do so in the future. I also have no doubt that she knows well and appreciates the issues in the trial as they have come to be crystallised in the previous proceedings. To the extent that the answers she gave under cross examination are relied upon by Mr Byrne SC to found a submission that she does not, even now, appreciate the significance of the time at which Mr Selim left Pan Pharmaceuticals, I reject that submission.  
     
      
      Has Mr Irwin deliberately withheld evidence and colluded with Mr Brooks? 
      
    28 I move now to the question of whether there has been any deliberate withholding of evidence from either Mr Irwin or Mr Brooks and, if so whether they colluded to ensure that this should occur. Were I satisfied that Mr Irwin has lied under oath, and that he has colluded with Mr Brooks to mislead the defence (and in turn the Local Court and District Courts) as to the true position in respect of the taking of his witness statement, and further, that they have both deliberately withheld the existence of the statement used in the process of its preparation, there may be some prospect of my being persuaded that a permanent stay should be ordered on the basis that it would be an abuse of process for me to stand by and permit them to participate in a further trial. I am however not satisfied that the evidence discloses they have misconducted themselves in this way. That is not to say that I am thoroughly satisfied that their evidence has been at all times entirely accurate or given with care. It is simply to say that I am not satisfied that they have lied or set out to deceive the Courts before whom this evidence was given.29 Mr Brooks was the first witness to be asked about the process by which his witness statement in cross-examination in the committal proceedings. It is important that I extract that evidence in some detail given the fact that Mr Byrne SC asks me to conclude that the evidence given by Mr Brooks at this time was either deliberately false or that his answers were designed to eschew any reference to the fact that the very first statement he made about the events of late January 2003 was to Pan Pharmaceuticals lawyers in circumstances where their legal interests and those of Mr Selim were not coincident. 30 At the committal proceeding he was asked the following questions: 
     
      
       
        
        Q. But the first statement you made was on 23 July 2003? 
         
        A. Which statement to the TGA? 
         
         
        Q. Mr Irwin? 
         
        A. Yes, yes it was, that’s right. 
         
         
        Q. There was a further statement made on 18 September 2003 2003? 
         
        A. Yeah, I’d like to see those. I can’t remember the exact dates…(T-57.37-46) 
         
         
         
        BYRNE: Q. Just to recap Mr Brooks, the first one was 23 July 2003? 
         
        A. Yes 23 July…(T-58.5-7) 
         
         
         
        Q. If I can ask you some general questions about the process of making these statements. You spent some considerable time with Mr Irwin on that day, is that right? 
         
        A. From memory, yes. 
         
         
        Q. How long did you spend with him, about compiling this statement? 
         
        A. It would have been several hours….(T-59.13-21) 
         
         
         
        Q. This one being the first probably took a lot longer than the others, is that fair to say? 
         
        A. Yes it is. 
         
         
        Q. You understood how important it was to give a true version of events in what you were saying? 
         
        A. Yes I did. 
         
         
        Q. You were going to be asked some questions about a matter that you considered to be a very serious one, is that right? 
         
        A. Yes. 
         
         
        Q. It was a very solemn occasion, it wasn’t just something that was a relatively straight forward every day occurrence was it? 
         
        A. No it wasn’t. 
         
         
        Q. It’s something in which you’ve never been involved before, making a statement to an investigator in relation to a matter that you regarded as very serious? 
         
        A. No I hadn’t been involved before. 
         
         
        Q. As you said you spent a considerable amount of time with him? 
         
        A. When I say I hadn’t done that before I’m just not when the ASIC statement was taken, so I’m just – I just want to make sure I don’t— 
         
         
        Q. It was done on 24 October 2004? 
         
        A. No I hadn’t done that kind of thing before then. 
         
         
        Q. We’ll come to that later, but I’m just concentrating now on this statement of 23 July? 
         
        A. Mm Hm…(T-59.35 to 60.11) 
         
         
        Q. This is a statement made on 24 October, right? 
         
        A. Yes. 
         
         
        Q. That’s with the benefit of the computer notes that you originally made, right? 
         
        A. No, this statement was actually faxed to Gail Thompson and she prepared that statement and then visited me at Pan to make sure that it looked okay and for me to sign it. 
         
         
        Q. To make sure that it looked okay? 
         
        A. Yes. So I didn’t actually make this statement to Gail in the same sense that I did to Mr Irwin. 
         
         
        Q. She prepared it for you? 
         
        A. Yes. I faxed it to her. I’ve got that here. 
         
         
        Q. She made the whole statement for you? 
         
        A. I’ve got that here. 
         
         
        Q. What did you say you’ve got there? 
         
        A. I’ve just got the fax that I sent to her. 
         
         
        Q. Can I have a look at that, please? 
         
        A. Of course. 
         
         
        Q. This document that you’ve just produced is a fax from you to Gail Thompson dated 21 October 2003, right? 
         
        A. Yes. 
         
         
        Q. And it says, “Gail, as requested by yourself please find following the five page statement that I made to Brett Irwin of the TGA on 23 July 2003 to be used as a starting point for a formal statement that I will make with you this coming Friday”, right? (T-81.46 – 82.21) 
        
       
      
    31 While it is true that Mr Brooks made no reference in his evidence to the statement he made to Pan Pharmaceuticals lawyers on 21 May 2003, a statement which as a matter of chronology was first in time, I am bound to allow for the logical possibility, before concluding that he lied or was dissembling, that he was distinguishing in his own mind for entirely innocent purposes between a statement to private lawyers retained by his employer and a statement given to investigators in the course of a criminal investigation, whether that be the TGA or the Australian Securities Investment Commission. 32 Mr Irwin was asked questions as to the same process in which he took the statement from Mr Brooks in the first trial.  
     
      
       
        
        Q. So between February and 23 July 2003 how many times would you have spoken to Mr Brooks in that period? 
         
        A. In that period not too many. 
         
         
        Q. Can you give us some help with that, what are we talking about? 
         
        A. Once or twice. 
         
         
        Q. You took the first statement that he made on 23 July 2003? 
         
        A. Yes. 
         
         
        Q. The process of taking that statement is a fairly lengthy one I suggest to you? 
         
        A. Yes. The original statement was, yes. 
         
         
        Q. It’s not simply a situation of Mr Brooks coming in and saying, well look here’s my statement. That’s all I want to say about it and leaving? 
         
        A. No. 
         
         
        Q. You sat down with him and went through with him in quite some considerable detail of the things that you considered were important is that right? 
         
        A. Yes I think – I believe on that occasion we actually spent time with him the day before as well. 
         
         
        Q. It’s a process of obtaining from the witness all of the things that the witness can say about the general investigation that you think are relevant? 
         
        A. At that stage, yes. 
         
         
        Q. It’s a painstaking process is it not? 
         
        A. Yes it is. 
         
         
        Q. You spoke to him the day before 23 July? 
         
        A. I believe so. 
         
         
        Q. How long for, approximately? 
         
        A. I couldn’t say. 
         
         
        Q. Was the conversation prior to 23 July along the general terms, these are the broad areas that we’re interested in, these are the kinds of topics that we want you to cover in your statement, these are the things we want you to think about, that kind of approach? 
         
        A. Yes… 
        ( 
        19/03/06 T-179.31 – 181.9) 
        
       
      
    33 Mr Irwin was also asked questions at the first trial as to the time he spent on 22 and 23 July compiling the statement from Mr Brooks, which he appointed to be 2-3 hours, and confirmed that the process by which the statement was taken, was by him asking Mr Brooks particular questions and, through that process, obtaining from him his version of events. He also gave evidence that the statement was taken on a laptop computer to enable corrections or amendments to be made as the statement was being prepared. (T19/03/06T182-184)34 It is clear that he made no mention of having utilised the statement to Blake Dawson Waldron as a template, or that he was given access to it at all. That said, I cannot be satisfied that this was a deliberate omission on his part, much less that it was motivated by a desire to conceal the fact because of some arrangement with Mr Brooks. Other inferences are equally open. It may be that by March 2006 he had simply forgotten the process by which the statement was taken from Mr Brooks and had forgotten that he had used the Blakes’ statement as a template. It may be that he is importing from the investigative process generally a ‘painstaking approach’ to the preparation of the Mr Brooks statement, when in fact that part of the process was made easier for him because the facts in a narrative and convenient form were at hand. (I note in this regard that in excess of 100 statements were included in the brief of evidence served – see Annexure G to Ms Lehn’s affidavit.) While it is difficult to see how his memory might have failed him or the convenience of having a prepared statement might have been overlooked, this alone does not allow me to find that he has lied. 35 I am fortified in this conclusion by the fact that on 9 October 2006 Mr Irwin produced his diary where he records against 22 July 2003 (the first of two days over which the statement was taken) the following: 
     
      
       
        
        “Brooks supplied a copy of the statement he supplied to Pan lawyers. (This statement was converted to TGA format) 
        
       
      
     
     
      
      and that at Mr Brooks independently produced under subpoena to him a version of the signed Blakes’ statement (MFI 21), albeit not the signed version that I am satisfied was likely to have been the one that Mr Irwin was given.  
      
    36 I will return to consider whether the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions should have taken steps of some kind to obtain the signed Blakes’ statement before 17 November 2006, and, if so the consequences that flow from their failure in that regard, when I come to considering the significance of the signed Blakes’ statement in the application for a temporary stay. 37 Accordingly, irrespective of whether the prosecution has or has not disclosed relevant material in sufficient detail and/or in a timely way either in advance of the committal, before the first trial or up to point where the jury were discharged in the second trial, and irrespective of whether that has resulted in unfairness against which relief might be given in the form of a temporary stay, I am not persuaded that it there has been any deliberate withholding of evidence by Mr Irwin or by Mr Brooks in collusion with Mr Irwin. Moreover, I am not persuaded that the prosecution has failed to discharge its duty since that time, or that it will fail to discharge its duty of disclosure in the unlikely event that relevant material comes to its notice from time to time during the trial before me. 38 I cannot and do not proceed on the untested assumption or unproved assertion that further material is likely be or might be in the possession of the prosecuting authorities, much less that this unidentified material will or may remain undisclosed because of irresponsibility, intransigence or worse on the part of the prosecuting authorities. 39 No adequate basis has been made out for my ordering a permanent stay and accordingly I dismiss the Notice of Motion that seeks that relief. 
     
      
      The Order for a Temporary Stay  
      
    40 Mr Selim seeks an order that the proceedings be stayed conditional upon the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions paying the reasonable the costs incurred by him committal proceedings in the Local Court in July 2005 and/or, following his committal for trial to the District Court, the costs of proceedings in respect of a trial before Judge Geraghty in March 2003 where a jury was discharged being unable to reach a unanimous verdict ( “ the first trial ), and/or the costs of a re- trial before Judge Sorby in November 2006 where the jury was discharged as a result of adverse publicity in the course of the trial (“the second trial”).41 The grounds upon which the temporary stay is sought are said in the Notice of Motion to be contained in the affidavit of Andrew Thorpe dated 13 February 2007. Mr Thorpe is Mr Selim’s solicitor. More precise grounds have been articulated by Mr Byrne SC in the course of argument. 42 They concern what is said to have been the failure on the part of the prosecting authorities to disclose to the defence relevant and material information of specified kinds in advance of each of the previous sets of trial proceedings, such as to have been productive of unfairness in the way Mr Selim was prosecuted in each of those sets of those proceedings. 43 I have had regard to the affidavit evidence and the oral evidence in its entirety and those parts of the transcript of the earlier proceedings to which my attention has been drawn for the purposes of determining whether a temporary stay should be granted. In so far as the committal proceeding is concerned a separate complaint is made.44 In order to clear the way to consider what I regard as the more substantial grounds for the orders sought, namely an order relating to the costs of the first and/or second trials, I will deal first with whether the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions should be required to pay the costs of the committal proceedings before it is permitted to put Mr Selim on his trial a third time. 
     
      
      The costs of the committal  
      
    45 As I understand the submission ultimately put by Mr Byrne on the applicant’s behalf, it is contended there was unfairness occasioned to Mr Selim because the committal proceedings were conducted on a false premise, namely that the date upon which it was then alleged Mr Selim procured Mr Brooks to destroy the evidence namely 31 January 2003 was different from the date upon which the Crown alleged this same conduct occurred at the first and second trials namely 30 January 2003. As a consequence, it is submitted, the conduct of the committal proceedings were forensically futile or “a waste”.46 I am unpersuaded that the committal proceedings were without forensic utility. Not only was I informed from the bar table that the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions did not oppose Mr Brooks being made available for cross examination pursuant to s 91 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (as amended), but my own review of the transcript of the committal proceedings makes it patent that cross examination was not limited to the date upon which the offence was alleged to have occurred but ranged over a variety of subjects relevant to a testing of his evidence generally. Quite apart from the fact that the committal proceedings would have been convened in any event, given that the matter was to proceed on indictment, and, quite apart from the fact that I am confident that there would have been an application to test the evidence of Mr Brooks irrespective of the date upon which it was alleged the offence had occurred, I am not satisfied that injustice of any kind has been demonstrated by the fact that by the first trial the relevant date had reverted to 30 January 2003. 47 While it is true that Mr Selim served an alibi notice in accordance with the Criminal Procedure Act following the committal proceedings, the detail of which establishes beyond any doubt that he was not at the Pan Pharmaceuticals premises at any relevant time on 31 January, this was not itself a forensically futile exercise. While it did not serve its intended purpose once the date was re established to be 30 January 2003, the “alibi” evidence was put to effective use in the first trial in any event by founding a means of attacking Mr Brooks’s reliability and undermining the strength of the Crown case. 48 The precise reason why the date changed from 30 January 2003 (the date Mr Brooks nominated in his statement of 23 July 2003 served on the defence as part of the brief of evidence) to 31 January 2003 prior to the committal, and the reason by he reverted to 30 January 2003 immediately prior to the first trial after a conference with prosecuting counsel, requires some appreciation of the evidence in the case. However, I do not consider it essential to track the evidence in any detail since I am firmly of the view that the change in date could not sensibly be attributed to fault on the part of prosecuting authorities in the management of their case, or to any misunderstanding on their part of the case they were intending to lead against Mr Selim. The change in dates is sufficiently explained by the fact that Mr Brooks claims to have made an error when he informed the prosecuting authorities of the necessity to change the date from 30 January to 31 January prior to committal, an error which he rectified after conferring with prosecuting counsel prior to trial on 8 March 2006 and after he determined from the internet traffic logs on the HPLC computer that the software he used to perform the low level format – the process by which the original data was designed to be rendered unreadable- was downloaded on 30 January 2003. It was that action that in his mind gave certainty to the date when he was given the destruction instruction by Mr Selim. The corrected error had the effect that he reverted to his original position, namely that the conduct with which Mr Selim is charged occurred on 30 January 2003. This was the case that was led by the Crown at the first trial and the second trial and will be the case to be led in any third trial. 49 Mr Byrne has not sought to make a case that there is fault or any relevant misconduct on the part of the prosecuting authorities in their conduct of the committal proceeding. He rests his claim for a temporary stay until the costs of committal are paid on the general claim that his client has suffered an injustice as a result of the error or mistake on the part Mr Brooks as a witness in the proceedings. Not only am I satisfied that this should not result in a financial penalty being visited upon the prosecuting authorities, I am unpersuaded, for the reasons I have already given, that there is any relevant injustice that has been occasioned to Mr Selim by that error and its later correction. Accordingly the discretion to order a temporary stay to enable Mr Selim to recover the costs of the committal is not enlivened and I refuse to order a stay referable to those costs. 
     
      
     
     
      
      The costs of the first and second trials 
      
    50 I move now to consider that part of the application that concerns the costs of the first and second trials.  
     
      
      The Power to Order a Temporary Stay 
      
    51 It is clear that this Court has the power to temporarily stay proceedings on indictment, effective until the Crown has paid the reasonable costs an accused has thrown away in previous proceedings, in circumstances where it has been demonstrated that an injustice or unfairness would result from the Courts processes being used to put an accused on trial a second or third time without some redress. I note that orders of the kind under consideration have been held to have been properly made where the conduct of the prosecuting authorities in adjourning a trial was unconscionable (R v Mosley (1992) 28 NSWLR 735); where fault was attributed to the prosecuting authorities by the production of relevant material in its possession very late in a second trial which resulted in the jury being discharged and in the accused being unable to afford private representation at his retrial (R v Fisher 56 NSWLR 625) and where the prosecuting authorities were found to be in flagrant breach of their duty to disclose evidence which had a tendency to show the accused could not have been involved in a transaction central to the Crown case (R v Ulman- Naruniec 143 A Crim R 531 per Belby J at 49 and Sulan J at 232). I note in the case of Ulman- Naruniec that while the Court was prepared to accept that the withholding of the information was not deliberate, no explanation from the prosecuting authorities was forthcoming to explain the failure to produce the material (Belby J at 537-8). 52 In each of the cases cited the exercise of the power is shown, in its application, to derive from the control the court exercises over its own processes so as to ensure trials are conducted fairly. 53 The onus of establishing unfairness of a relevant kind rests on the applicant. It is not the law that there is any necessary unfairness to an accused by the mere fact of there being a second or even a third trial in respect of the same alleged criminal conduct. Mr Byrne SC does not contend otherwise. 54 The parties are not in agreement however as to whether some fault or misconduct on the part of the prosecuting authorities giving rise to the injustice complained of needs to be established, and, if so, the degree of fault or the seriousness of the misconduct, before the discretion to make an order for a temporary stay is enlivened.  
     
      
      Is There a Test to be Applied? 
      
    55 In R v Fisher at [7], Justice Santow was of the view that a temporary stay of the kind sought here should only be granted for the rare and extreme case of gross unfairness on the part of the Crown. Implicitly, he was satisfied on the facts of that case that error of that kind had been shown. In the same case Justice Simpson described the circumstances in which relief was or might be available as special and unusual, however, contrary to the submission advanced by Mr Robberds QC, I am of the view that Her Honour, when using that expression was referring to the way in which the power to order a stay came before the Court in Mosley, as distinct from a set of characteristics that must be found to obtain in every case before a temporary stay should be ordered [para 24 and para 47].56 Mr Byrne SC submits that in this case there has, in any event, been a demonstrated and gross unfairness suffered by his client in having to bear the costs of proceedings that were tainted by the misconduct of the prosecuting authorities in discharge of their responsibilities to disclose to the defence relevant material. While Mr Robberds QC urges me to accept that there are preconditions to the exercise of the discretion to order a temporary stay in the terms in which their Honours expressed it in Fisher he submits that even if that not be the test, Mr Selim has suffered no unfairness from the way in which the prosecuting authorities have conducted the trial proceedings against him and that no misconduct of any kind has been shown. 57 Whether the test is as stringent as the terms in which Justice Santow expresses it, indeed whether there is a test as such to be applied before a temporary stay should be ordered, I do not consider falls to me to decide. I am content to proceed on the basis that there needs to be demonstrated an identifiable injustice for which it can be sensibly said the prosecuting authorities should be held responsible before a temporary stay is ordered, given that the effect of ordering the stay is to impose on them the costs of previous proceedings before they may be permitted to prosecute again. 58 I do not proceed on the basis that it necessary for the applicant in this case to establish fault, in the sense of male fides on the part of the prosecuting authorities in their failure to disclose the information complained of, accepting, as I do, that inadvertence or error may be sufficient (see Simpson J in Fisher at [24] and [47]), however I must be satisfied that it is an error committed in discharge of the duty of disclosure, or inadvertence as to the extent to which that duty required production of material to the defence, before relief could be granted. I also proceed on the basis I do not have to be satisfied that there is a causal link between the fact of non-disclosure and the reason for a retrial (R v Ulman- Naruniec). That said however, an explanation for the late disclosure, where it is available, it not without importance given that the nature of the remedy that is sought is an unusual one, requiring me to give due weight to the public interest that is served by the Crown being permitted to bring a person to trial without preconditions being imposed on the right to prosecute, so ever long as this is done without unfairness to the accused. For that reason, the extent to which the Crown or the prosecuting authorities in the present case have contributed to the fact that certain material was not available in the first trial and/or whether they contributed to the situation that presented during the course of the retrial when the signed Blakes’ statement of 21 May 2003 was produced for the first time, is not without importance. An explanation for the late disclosure may also have a bearing on whether an order of the kind here sought should ultimately be made. As Sulan J observed in R v Ulman-Naruniec 143 A Crim R 532 at 562, when speaking of the vigilance with which the prosecution must approach the discharge of its duties: 
     
      
       
        
        …..not every failure to make full disclosure will result in a miscarriage of justice. No system is perfect. Not every investigation or trial will be perfect. In any system which relies on human beings, error can occur. There are, however, circumstances in which the party’s obligation are so serious that the Court will intervene to protect an abuse of its processes.  
        
       
      
    59 Even though these observations were made in the context of his Honour considering whether a permanent stay should be granted, I consider they are apposite to the exercise of my discretion for the grant of a temporary stay in this case. It is important to keep in mind that the granting of a temporary stay until costs of the previous proceedings, or some part of them, are paid is not designed to punish the Crown for inadequacies in pre- trial or trial process, or deficiencies of which there may be many in the course of an investigation, but to redress an injustice that can be shown to be the result of the late disclosure of information where this is in breach of the prosecution’s duty to disclosure. 60 As I see it, one of the questions for determination in the present case is whether, in all the circumstances, I am persuaded that the identified categories of information, said by the applicant to be relevant and material to his defence, should have been produced in a more timely fashion and, if I am satisfied they were not, whether their late production was in breach of the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions’ duty of disclosure or that they contributed in a material way to that state of affairs. 61 In order to answer this question I must consider whether the information was relevantly in the possession of those who had the corresponding duty to disclose. 62 I must also consider, as I see it, whether there are any reasons why the information was not disclosed earlier, either at the time that it was known to be in the prosecutor’s possession, or at some time prior to the first or second trials. This will necessarily involve me deciding the extent to which the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions had a duty to make enquires of third parties who may have been in possession of material of relevance, or potential relevance to the proceedings. It will also involve me deciding whether any failure on the part of the investigators to retain materials gathered in that process, is sheeted home to the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions such as to put it in constructive breach of their independent duty of disclosure. As to the last question the parties are agreed that the duty of the prosecuting authorities is a collective duty in the sense that the investigators have a duty to make known and available material in their possession that may be relevant, and that any failure to make that material known to the prosecution will be a breach of the duty of disclosure for which a remedy of an appropriate kind might be sought (see generally Grey v The Queen [2001] HCA 65 and Mallard v The Queen 224 CLR 125 where undisclosed material of relevance to a material issue in the trial proceedings was held to have resulted in a miscarriage of justice). 
     
      
      Nature of any Injustice arising in the First and Second Trials 
      
    63 In so far as the proceedings at the first trial are concerned, it is submitted that so egregious is the nature and extent of the failure to disclse relevant material to the defence before the trial that Mr Selim has been deprived of the fact of an acquittal (cf the reasonable prospect of an acquittal) occasioning, in the result, such injustice that he should be entitled to recover the costs of the first trial and, by parity of reasoning the costs associated with his retrial, before he is prosecuted further. (The material at issue here is the “Fraser email” as to which see later). 64 Were I to find that there was a failure to disclose that material before the first trial, but that it was not of such weight or significance that with reasonable certainty it would have resulted in an acquittal, then it is submitted, I should find that the costs of the first and second trials should be borne by the prosecution on a separate basis, namely to remedy an injustice that resulted when other material was produced for the first time during the second trial. (The material referred to here is the signed Blakes’ statement.) 65 In effect, I am asked to find that the application to discharge the jury in the second trial on the basis of the late disclosure of the Blakes’ signed statement, an application that was being considered by his Honour Judge Sorby at the time of the publication of the prejudicial press article, would have been successful and that this would have resulted in a successful application for a temporary stay of any retrial in the District Court. Although there is some similarities in the proceedings before the trial judge and the proceedings before me there are also important differences. It may have been that without the intervention of the prejudicial publicity his Honour may simply have adjourned the proceedings to allow the significance of the signed Blakes’ statement to be explored rather than taking the extreme measure of discharging the jury. In addition, he may have allowed Mr Byrne SC to examine Mr Brooks on the voir dire as to the provenance of the document or permitted the recall of Mr Irwin for the same purpose. For these reasons the fact that there was an application before the trial judge to discharge the jury which, if granted, may have been the foundational to a stay of any retrial until the costs of the second trial were paid, has no ultimate bearing on whether I grant the applicant the relief he seeks. 66 I have already referred to R v Spiteri as specifying the nature and extent of the prosecutor’s duty of disclosure. Whether it has been shown to have been breached, and if so when it was breached; the significance or materiality of the information that was produced after the first trial and in the course of the second trial; and, ultimately, whether any injustice results from production at that time are also questions at issue in this aspect of the proceedings.  
     
      
      “The Fraser email”  
      
    67 This is an email passing between the Investigator Mr Irwin and Mr Fraser an officer of the TGA of 28 June 2005 (and a related email passing between Mr Irwin and Mr Prestridge another officer of the TGA) each of which were copied to Ms Lehn of the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions on the same date. In the email Mr Fraser estimates the time at which Mr Selim left the Pan Pharmaceuticals premises on 30 January in the company of Mr Tribe, another TGA officer at “about 5.30 – 6.00” (see Annexure 9 to Mr Thorpe’s affidavit). It is the applicant’s case that these emails should have been disclosed to the defence prior to the committal proceedings commencing in the Local Court on 18 July 2005 but were not disclosed until after the first trial.  
    68 I note that the e-mails became available to the defence in the second trial as a result of a subpoena issued by the defence to the TGA in September 2006 - that is between the first and second trials. I also note in that regard that as at that date the email passing between Mr Irwin and Mr Prestridge was no longer recoverable from the TGA computer system. However, upon a search being made by Ms Lehn of the computer system at the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions, it was retrieved and produced under cover of correspondence between the Ms Lehn and Mr Thorpe on 19 September 2006 (Annexure AE to Ms Lehn’s affidavit). 69 It is Ms Lehn’s evidence that she had quite simply forgotten of the existence or content of the emails when the issue of the time at which Mr Selim left Pan Pharmaceuticals on the 30th January was the subject of cross examination at the first trial. I accept this evidence as truthful. Mr Byrne SC has not submitted that I should find otherwise. He has however sought to persuade me that I should find Ms Lehn’s explanation for failing to produce the emails at the time she received them in June2005 –13 days before the committal proceedings - as inadequate or unacceptable, and that that I should conclude that notwithstanding her having forgotten about them by the time of the first trial some 8 months later, she breached her duty of disclosure by not disclosing them at the time they were received. He submits that while this is an important factual finding on the application, even were I to find that there is an adequate explanation for her not producing the emails in the days prior to committal, the fact of their non production was productive of injustice and his client should not have to bear the costs of that injustice. In short, he says that error on her part whether it sources in part from a failure of memory of a lack of appreciation of the significance of the evidence to the defence, will not relieve the prosecuting authorities of the responsibility of remedying a resultant injustice. 70 Applying the test as laid down in Spiteri, I do not regard Ms Lehn as in relevantly in breach of a duty of disclosure at or during the first trial given that had genuinely forgotten that the Fraser email had been copied to her. 71 On the other hand, accepting as I do that the timing of Mr Selim departure from the Pan Pharmaceuticals with Mr Tribe on 30 January 2003 was being reviewed by Mr Irwin with his fellow TGA officers in the emails, and that this was very likely if not certainly because of the defence subpoenas that had at that time issued to Qantas, the RTA and a telephone company dealing with Mr Tribe’s travel movements and Mr Selim’s whereabouts, it is difficult to conclude that Mr Fraser’s estimate of the time of Mr Tribe’s departure was not at least possibly relevant to an issue in the case. It is not to the point that the precise time at which the conversation between Mr Selim and Mr Brooks was not an element of the offence. It is moreover not to the point that the Fraser email was an estimate only of the departure time. What is to the point, is that it was a matter that the prosecution was on notice may be relevant to the ultimate question as to whether the destruction instruction or a relevant subsequent conversation took place at all, depending at that time on all the evidence which was then available or might later be brought to bear on the issue. 72 Even if it be a breach in a minor respect, only highlighted because of the inordinate focus that has been given to the issue for the purpose of these proceedings as distinct from its significance to the issues at trial, I do regard the emails as material that should have been disclosed at the time of their receipt in June 2005. I wish to make it clear that this finding is made without in any way reflecting on Ms Lehn’s diligence and professionalism. It is for this reason that I disregarded the breach entirely when deciding, for the purposes of ruling on the application for a permanent stay, whether I had any basis for doubting the integrity and intelligence with which she has discharged her professional duties to the Court in the past such as may cause me concern about her future capacity to do the same. 73 While I am satisfied that Ms Lehn should have made the email available to the defence in the 13 day window of opportunity prior to committal, I do not regard her failure as being productive of the injustice Mr Byrne SC complains of on his clients’ behalf. This is because I am not persuaded that the evidential value of the Fraser email is such that it would have resulted in the jury acquitting Mr Selim at the first trial. Since the email was available at the second trial I do not have to concern myself with whether the costs of the second trial are recoverable on this basis. 
     
      
      The significance or materiality of the Fraser email  
      
    74 I have received both oral and written submissions directed to the significance or materiality of the Fraser email in the first trial. I am not sitting as a member of the Court of Criminal Appeal after conviction, as was case In Grey where the question posed was whether the breach of the duty of disclosure in that case gave rise to a miscarriage of justice, because the accused lost the prospect of an acquittal, I am, in effect, being asked to put myself in the position of the jury in the first trial and resolve what they would have done with this one item of evidence in the context of a trial that was in no sense a single issue trial. The addresses from counsel, extending as they did over some days bear out my view that the trial was both complex and the issues multi layered. The timing of Mr Selim’s departure from the Pan Pharmaceuticals premises was at issue in the trial given that Mr Brooks had given evidence that he was spoken to by Mr Selim between approximately 6.30 and then again within 15 0r 20 minutes of that time, and there was wealth of evidence pointing to there being real doubt as to whether Mr Selim was at Pan Pharmaceuticals at this time, but that was not the only challenge to the Crown case. I have listened carefully to the reconstruction of the arguments put to the jury on the issue of the time at which events occurred, and the question of whether by reference to that analysis Mr Selim was implicated in criminal conduct by directing that Mr Brooks destroy the computer data, but I am left with the clear impression that the Fraser email would not have had the effect that Mr Byrne SC contends for. Put coarsely, the Fraser email is what not what might be described as a “smoking gun”. For whatever reason the jury were unable to reach a unanimous verdict, I cannot come to the conclusion that an email from Mr Fraser in June 2005 as to his recollection of the time that Mr Selim left the premises two years earlier with Mr Tribe, would have so overwhelmed the jury that they would have unanimously agreed that there was a reasonable doubt as to whether the conversation occurred at all such a to warrant an acquittal. 75 I note without reciting it that each of officers Fraser and Tribe gave evidence at the first trial. Mr Fraser gave evidence that he finished work on 30 January 2003 at approximately 6pm and that Mr Tribe and Mr Selim left before him. Mr Tribe gave evidence that he recalled leaving before Mr Fraser and confirmed that Mr Selim was with him. Mr Fraser did not give evidence of the time that he left the premises but Mr Prestridge with whom Mr Fraser was travelling said that they left together between perhaps 5.30 and 6.30pm. It is not clear what evidence Fraser gave, if any, as to when Mr Tribe (and Mr Selim) left the premises. It was clear however that they left before him. In the second trial Mr Fraser was called before the trial aborted. By that time of course the email had been produced. Mr Byrne SC read the contents of the email into evidence.76 I refuse to order a temporary stay on the basis of late production of the Fraser email. 
     
      
      “The signed Blakes’ statement“ or “The statement of 21 May 2003”. 
      
    77 There is in evidence before me a statement signed and dated by Mr Brooks on 21 May 2003 (Annexure 16 to Mr Thorpe’s affidavit and Annexure AT to Ms Lehn’s affidavit). This has been referred to by me as “the signed Blakes’ statement” for ease of reference since, as I have noted earlier in these reasons, it was made to a solicitor employed by Blake Dawson Waldron solicitors, retained to act on behalf of the liquidator of Pan Pharmaceuticals Limited. 78 This document is to be distinguished from what I am satisfied is an earlier version of that statement, notwithstanding that the version of the draft bears the date 19/11/03. I shall refer to the latter document as MFI 21 solely because that is the identifier given to it in the second trial and the way it has been referred to in argument before me (Annexure 17 to Mr Thorpe’s affidavit). The weight of evidence and the submissions advanced by Mr Robberds QC as to the way I should interpret the exchange of emails between Mr Brooks and Ms Bylhouwer of 19 November 2003 (behind Annexure AY of Ms Lehn’s affidavit) satisfies me that this is the case, and I am satisfied of this notwithstanding the fact Mr Brooks has not given evidence on the issue to date. He has not given evidence because MFI 21 was not produced until after the first trial and the second trial aborted before he had been called to give evidence at all. 79 Mr Brooks made a total of six statements to Mr Irwin in the course of the investigation up to and including a statement of 10 March 2006, within days of the first trial. (It was in this statement that he explained, in effect why he was reverting to 30 January 2003 as the date upon which relevant events occurred) The first of these six statements, and the only statement relevant for this aspect of the argument, is dated 27July 2003 (see Annexure 2 of Mr Thorpe’s affidavit and Annexure K of Ms Lehn’s affidavit). I shall refer to that statement as the TGA statement. 80 I am satisfied for the purposes of this application that the signed Blakes’ statement which is dated 21 May 2005 and which predates the TGA statement dated 23 July 2003 was in fact the statement used by Mr Irwin as a template when he came to take the TGA statement from Mr Brooks on 22 and 23 July 2003. Furthermore, I am satisfied that this is the statement Mr Irwin was given a copy of by Mr Brooks on the 22 July 2003 as he records in his diary against that date. There is no evidence to suggest that there is any other statement made to Pan Lawyers as at the date when Mr Irwin took the statement from Mr Brooks as part of the investigation by the TGA. No other rational conclusion is open on the evidence before me, and, as I have already observed, there are no material differences between the statements such as would give rise to a concern that Mr Irwin was given access to any other statement.81 The fact that Mr Irwin has prepared the TGA statement by utilising the signed Blakes’ statement was not known by either the defence or officers of the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions until Mr Irwin’s diary was produced in July 2006 ie after the first trial and before the second trial. While the signed Blakes’ statement was not available to the defence until 17 November 2006, that is during the course of the second trial, MFI 21 was available to the defence, it having been produced on subpoena by Mr Brooks before the second trial. 82 This existence of the signed Blakes’ statement is said by Mr Byrne SC to have a direct bearing on the circumstances in which Mr Brooks came to give his first statement to Mr Irwin of 23 July 2003 and, that is a circumstance of such significance that it should have been disclosed to the defence by Mr Irwin in advance of the committal proceedings and/ or discrete enquires made as to its whereabouts when its existence, or likely existence, was made known to the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions after the first trial by Mr Irwin.  
    83 I am satisfied that the existence or likely existence of a document of this kind was only known to the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions when reference was made to it in an entry in Mr Irwin’s diary also produced under subpoena issued by the defence and returnable in July 2006. I am also satisfied that at that time Ms Lehn has assumed, wrongly as it turns out, that the statement to which the diary entry referred was, or was likely to have already been produced to the defence by Mr Brooks, given that on its face MFI 21 seemed to be as she described it a “ civil statement“ since it contained no durat, and that its contents were very similar to the TGA statement. It is true she made no enquiries to confirm that this was so but then neither it seems did Mr Thorpe notwithstanding that he knew the Blake Dawson Waldron were the solicitors acting for Pan Pharmaceuticals and that he could have issued a subpoena to them seeking production of the document and documents related to it. He does not explain why he did not take that course. He also effectively, albiet understandably from his perspective, closed his mind to the possibility that MFI 21 was the statement to which the diary entry referred because of the date printed on the document of 19/11/03. 84 The only conclusion that I can fairly draw from the misassumptions made by the both Ms Lehn and those she instructed at trial, and Mr Thorpe and those he instructed at trial, is that they were ultimately productive of understandable and thoroughly honest errors. Just as no blame can be levelled at Mr Thorpe for failing to make enquiries on his client’s behalf as to the whereabouts of the statement to which Mr Irwin’s diary refers, similarly no finding adverse to Ms Lehn, or the prosecuting authorities more generally can safely be drawn by the fact that Ms Lehn accepted, without more, the account Mr Irwin gave to her to the effect that he believed that the statement Mr Brooks produced under subpoena was the document he had had access to, although he told Ms Lehn that he could not be sure of it. I come to that view as I am not persuaded that Mr Irwin has deliberately misled the prosecution any more than he has deliberately misled the Court, although, as I have said his evidence is not without features that cause me some disquiet.85 I can however, perhaps with the benefit of the perfect vision I am afforded, see a proper basis for a further statement to have been taken from Mr Irwin detailing the circumstances in which the statement from Mr Brooks was taken, once he was reminded of it when he produced his diary and once it came by that means to the attention of Ms Lehn. That this did not happen, and that a corrected account of the circumstances in which the statement was taken from Mr Brooks surfaced in cross-examination for the first time at the second trial, is regrettable. The fact that it did not happen however does not make out a case that the prosecuting authorities have misconducted themselves, or that they have breached their duty of disclosure in some way. This is gainsaid by the fact that Ms Lehn genuinely believed (as apparently did Mr Hastings QC Crown counsel at the second trial) that the document had already been produced. 86 I am not satisfied that there has been any breach of the duty of disclosure in respect of the signed Blakes’ statement, or that the prosecuting authorities have misconducted themselves by their piecemeal acknowledgment of the use that was made of it. 
     
      
      The significance or materiality of the signed Blakes’ statement  
      
    87 If I am wrong about that, and there is relevant misconduct on the part of the prosecuting authorities or that the failure to produce the material is a state of affairs for which the prosecuting authorities should be held responsible, I am nevertheless not persuaded that the signed Blakes’ statement of 21 May 2003 was of sufficient materiality to the proceedings at the earlier trials such that its late production is productive of injustice. That is not to say that circumstances is which a witness statement is taken may not, in a given case, be relevant. For example, where it can be shown or suggested that some pressure was brought to bear on a witness, or some suggestion is made as to what the witness should include or exclude in a statement, or where the investigating officer was compromised by a conflict of interest thereby compromising the integrity of the investigation (R v Frangulis [2006] NSWCCA 363) then the failure to disclose material that might establish those facts would be a most material breach. Nothing of that kind is suggested here. While consistency between the signed Blakes’ statement and the TGA statement does not advance the strength of prosecution case as a matter of logic (it plainly does not as matter of law) neither does the consistency between the statements necessarily advance the defence case, although it may be something the cross examiner might chose to make use of when testing Mr Brooks. I do not see that the inability to test him on this subject at the first trial deprived Mr Selim of any measurable forensic advantage. I am not satisfied that its late production would necessarily found an application to discharge the jury, although, as I have made clear, I refrain from posing that question for myself.  
     
      
      Conference Notes of 8 March 2003 
      
    88 It is submitted that the notes of a conference with Mr Hastings QC, then senior counsel for the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions and Mr Brooks on 8 March 2006, that is in the week prior to the first trial on 13 March 2006, should have been produced before the first trial. These notes, and other notes of conferences with Mr Brooks were produced for the first time by Ms Lehn at the request of junior counsel for the applicant on 3 November 2006 (Annexure AP to Ms Lehn’s affidavit ).89 No complaint is made about late disclosure of notes other than those of 8 March 2006.90 It is apparent from the notes, and confirmed by Ms Lehn in her evidence before me, that the significant issue that was canvassed with Mr Brooks in the conference was the question of the date on which the significant conversations occurred at the Pan Pharmaceuticals premises not the time at which they occurred. The date was an issue because, as I have noted, an alibi notice had been served by the defence concerning Mr Selim’s movements 31 January and, again as I have noted it was the prosecution case at committal and up to 8 March 2003 that the conversation between Mr Selim and Mr Brooks occurred on 31 January 2003. It is also clear from the notes that Mr Hastings was concerned to let Mr Brooks know of the various sources of information that raised real doubts as to whether the conversation, if it occurred, took place on 31 January. As Ms Lehn expresses it in her evidence before me, Mr Hastings put it quite forcefully to Mr Brooks that the prosecution was possessed of information that would indicate that Mr Selim was not at the Pan Pharmaceuticals premises at 6.30 on 31 January 2003. Quite properly Mr Brooks was not informed that an alibi notice had been served. 91 It is however clear from the conference notes that consistent with what Mr Brooks had said about the time of the conversation in his various statements and in his committal evidence, namely about 6.30pm, that this remained his firm position even if there were doubts in his mind as to the date. 92 The fact that Mr Brooks conferred with Mr Hastings QC a few days before 1O March 2006, when he furnished a further statement in which he reverted to 30 January being the relevant date, was given in evidence during his cross examination at the first trial (T369/19-30). In this way, the defence were on notice not only that the conference took place but what was discussed. Mr Brooks gave evidence that the details provided to him by Mr Hastings QC related to toll gate records and various telephone records (T43, 497 and 498 and 524). This was noted by Ms Lehn in the conference notes. Contrary to the submission advanced by Mr Byrne SC before me, this evidence not only provided a means by which Mr Brooks could be challenged as to why he changed the date of the conversation back to 30 January 2003 namely because the prosecution led him to see that the date must be wrong, but by necessary inference and on a fair read of his address to the jury on this discrete subject, this is precisely a submission he made to them (29/03/06 pages 29 and 30). 93 In practical sense then the fact of the conference and what was discussed was disclosed by Mr Brooks in his evidence He did not give evidence inconsistent with what he said in conference about the time of the conversation, and what he said in conference was not inconsistent with it. Were that the case it may have necessary to disclose the notes themselves. The notes of conference were not called for. 94 Applying the test in Spiteri I am not persuaded that there has been any breach of the duty of disclosure in the conference notes not being formally produced prior to, or the during the course of, the first trial. 95 If I am wrong about that I am firmly of the view that no prejudice was suffered by Mr Selim by the notes being provided after the first trial and accordingly no basis for a temporary stay to recover the costs of the first trial on this basis has been made out.  
     
      
      Conclusion 
      
    96 In summary I refuse the application for a permanent stay for the reasons given and refuse the application for a temporary stay again for the reasons given.

    SENTENCE1 HIS HONOUR: The offender, Benjamin Elthan, pleaded guilty before his Honour Judge Nield on 20 February 2007 to a single offence of breaking and entering and committing a serious indictable offence, namely stealing three cartons of Jim Beam and Cola in circumstances of aggravation, namely that he was in company of two other persons who are both juveniles. He has also asked that I take into account on a Form 1, an offence of taking and driving a conveyance without the consent of the owner and entering a dwelling with intent to commit a serious indictable offence and I take those matters into account.2 The facts were that the offender, who at the time was on parole, was drinking with two juveniles and other persons in the village of Woodstock which apparently is near Cowra. They became intoxicated. They ran out of alcohol and were desperate to obtain more. They could not get any more at Woodstock; they needed to get to Cowra to get more and they could not persuade anyone to drive them to Cowra for the purpose of buying more alcohol. At about 2.30 in the morning the offender entered a garage at 41 Noyeau Street, Woodstock, and started and drove away a motor vehicle belonging to a Julie-Anne Sigsworth. The two juveniles joined him. As is often the case in country areas, the householder believed her car was safe and left the keys in it. The three then drove to Cowra and to a store known as the Cellarbrations Liquor Store. At about 3.25am the offender reversed the vehicle into the front doors knocking them off the frame and the car then went into the store itself. It became jammed between two concrete bollards at the front of the store.3 One of the juveniles jumped over the vehicle into the store and grabbed three cartons of Jim Beam and Cola which he slid over the roof of the vehicle to the other offenders. All three then went to a nearby park where they hid the three cartons under a bandstand. They then left the park.4 Police attended the scene, viewed closed circuit television footage of the break in. This enabled them to identify the offenders and at about twenty to five in the morning all three were arrested in central Cowra. The juveniles when confronted with arrest, made full admissions, the offender did not.5 He pleaded guilty on indictment on the first day of the hearing before Judge Nield and the matter was remanded for sentence and I have come to sentence him.6 The offender gave evidence before me and said that he had been committed from Cowra where he was represented by a private solicitor. About two weeks before the trial he indicated, having spoken to his current counsel and solicitor, that he was prepared to plead guilty. That in fact was the first time he had had any real opportunity to speak to a lawyer. The person who represented him at Cowra apparently did not speak to him.7 The offender was born on 14 June 1980; he is thus 26 years old. He first came before courts in 1997 when he was 17 years old. His first offences were dishonesty offences and from that time until 1999 he appeared frequently in Local Courts in Dubbo and Bathurst for summary offences involving driving motor vehicles for which he has never had a licence, stealing, stealing motor cars, breaching bail and a few minor assault charges.8 Until 8 November 1999 he was not sent to gaol; he was put on recognisance. It says here he was given fines, all sorts of things were done but eventually he was dealt with before Local Court for breaking and entering and stealing on 8 November 1999 and given a minimum of three months with an additional term of six months on a series of break and enters. All of these sentences were made concurrent.9 From that time on he has been in and out of gaol for short sentences for such things as driving whilst disqualified, stealing motor vehicles, self administering drugs, stealing and driving under the influence and offences of a like type. He has also been dealt with in the Goulburn area and the Wagga area so he has not confined break and enters and stealing and the like merely to Bathurst or Dubbo.10 It can be said that his criminal record is a depressing one as page after page follows with conviction after conviction and sentence of imprisonment after sentence of imprisonment. At various times Magistrates in Local Courts obviously attempted to impose bonds on him with supervision to see if something could be done. He was even given the benefit of a large number of s 10 bonds in 2001. However, none of this seemed to matter because he kept going back to what he was doing. In 2001 he was back into break and entering a building and driving whilst disqualified and he got sentences of imprisonment. He was dealt for twice in that year for those sorts of offences.11 In 2002 he came before a Local Court for stealing quite a large sum of money, he was given a suspended sentence and a fine. In 2002 he came before the Cowra Local Court for breaking and entering a building and stealing and was given and eighteen months suspended sentence with supervision by the Probation and Parole Service who were directed to give him drug and alcohol counselling.12 In 2003 he got twelve months’ imprisonment for being carried in a conveyance without consent. Later in 2003 he came before the District Court in Bathurst and was given a three years sentence of imprisonment with a non-parole period of eighteen months. If anything should have caused him to wake up, it should have been that. By this stage he was moving into offences that were being prosecuted in this Court rather than in the Local Court.13 However, he continued doing what he was doing and in 2004 he came before the District Court at Wagga Wagga for breaking and entering a building and stealing and got three years with an eighteen month non-parole period - sorry that is with a one year non-parole period and another one year sentence for taking and driving a conveyance without the consent of the owner. In 2004 he came before the Newcastle District Court for larceny for which he got six months imprisonment, for breaking and entering a building for which he got two years and three months with a non-parole period of twelve months. And the two year three months was to conclude on 26 October 2006 and he was accordingly on that parole when he committed this offence which is yet again a break and entering only this time one done with considerable violence using a motor vehicle to smash in a liquor store.14 There can be no doubt that the reason for this incredible catalogue of offences arises from his having a dependence on alcohol. He had a sad life, I accept that and I have read or I have heard him give evidence to that effect. He grew up in a house or not really a house, a series of hotels with his mother. He would, as a child, have breakfast drinking beer with his food. It was plain his mother was an alcoholic and eventually when he was 12 or 13 he was placed in a foster home which was in fact a family group home in Orange.15 For the first time in his life he had somewhere proper to live, he joined the scouts and he felt reasonably content. However, the government cut the funding for the place and everyone there was forced to leave. He then went off to Dubbo and became introduced to cannabis and amphetamines and alcohol and ever since that time he has been involved in an adverse way with the criminal law.16 His explanation for the offences on this night were that he had run out of grog, he does not blame the juveniles and he acknowledges somebody could have been injured or killed if they had been in the store. I would accept it was not his intention to injure or kill anyone and he did not really think about the consequences of what he was doing. Those consequences included severely damaging a motorcar that he stole from someone who no doubt needed it for work purposes and other purposes, damaging the premises of a bottle shop and then depriving the owner of three cartons of alcohol.17 It has been put to me and I would accept that the three involved in this could have removed all the alcohol from the shop. Had they been minded to so do, they could have stolen money and other valuable items in the store. They did not do that. Their only interest was getting these three crates of bourbon.18 I read a pre-sentence report which makes it plain that his real problem is alcohol. To a lesser extent he has had some experience of using illegal drugs but he has told me and I would accept that his real problem is alcohol. The Probation and Parole Service considered that he had scant regard for authority and the effect his offending had on other people. They acknowledge he had poor role models in his life and they suggested I should specify attendance at relapse prevention programs and random urinalysis testing and that he should also be admitted to a long term residential rehabilitation program when admitted to parole.19 Jodie Lee Bryant, a young woman of 18 who is studying childcare at her TAFE, gave evidence that she had met him in 2005 and visits him and will continue to support him. She said that he is nice when he is sober.20 The two juveniles were dealt with in a way that seemed to the learned Children’s Court Magistrate to be appropriate, having regard to the fact that they had no real records of anything and they were not sent into any form of custody.21 His counsel, Mr Button SC, submitted I should give him a head sentence of three years and one day with a non-parole period of eighteen months. He is currently in custody, his parole having been revoked. It was put to me if I imposed three years and one day, it would be up to the parole authorities as to whether he would be released. I could not direct he be released because it is one day longer than three years and that would impose on him real incentives to do something positive while he was in gaol otherwise they would not necessarily release him. It was put to me by Mr Button that the fact that he has been dealt with on a number of previous occasions in the District Court for offences of a similar nature, breaking and entering buildings and given sentences of three years, two years and the like, does not mean he should get exactly the same type of sentence today.22 I certainly agree there is no principle that if a person keeps committing a similar offence there is an automatic increase of the sentence each time that a similar offence is committed. Nothing is automatic and I must take into account all the relevant facts. I must take into account, as I am sure every other judicial officer did, the fact of his very sad childhood. It is undoubtedly a fact that if people are brought up by parents who abandon them and expose them to alcohol from an early age, the chances of them getting involved in offences is very high.23 The Bureau of Criminal Research and Statistics - I think that is what it is called - recently published a survey which is a scientific survey which indicated that if people are going into the Children’s Court system when they are young, they quite often will continue on and be major players in the adult criminal justice system. He seems to fit into that category.24 His big problem is alcohol. Every single offence is in some way connected with alcohol or drugs but over the years the offending is gradually getting more serious. Breaking and entering a building is a serious enough matter but smashing your way into the building with a car is more serious than it. It is actually, in reality, an act of considerable violence. And doing it with two juveniles in it who may well have been injured in the impact also shows to my mind a degree of utter irresponsibility. No doubt at the time he was not thinking about this because his mind was focussed only on one thing and that is to get more alcohol and his mind was focussed on that because he is an alcoholic.25 I have already said I doubt that he particularly took any note of the deprivation that the householder suffered when her car was removed from her garage. The last thing in his mind was that she would be upset by this. He did not consider in any way that not only could it be extremely inconvenient but getting it fixed when he smashed it could be very expensive and time consuming and she could be deprived of her vehicle for a lengthy time. The place she is living is some distance from Cowra; obviously without a motor vehicle anybody wanting to go to Cowra could be in a very awkward situation. 26 He could not get to Cowra himself easily because he had no car.27 The prosecutor referred me to s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. That lays down the purposes for which a court may impose a sentence and they are to ensure the offender is adequately punished to prevent crime by deterring the offender and other persons from committing similar offences, to protect the community from the offender, to promote the rehabilitation of the offender, to make the offender accountable for his actions, to denounce the conduct of the offender, to recognise the harm done to the victim of the crime and the community. I must take into account all those matters.28 I am unable to agree with Mr Button that I should take the course he suggests. I think it would be utterly inappropriate to take such a course. I accept that the offender has some half-formed view - I can only put it as high as that - to do something about his alcohol problems but that really in itself is not a proper basis for me to impose a sentence which does not recognise the fact that this crime is more serious than any of the previous ones he has committed. He has to get a sentence that recognises that fact and he has to be aware of the fact that it is only his actions that have put him in this position. And as the years go on, if he keeps coming back, inevitably the offences will get more serious and the sentences will get heavier.29 It seems to me the appropriate sentencing level leaving aside discounts, would be a non-parole period of three years and a head sentence of six years. The difference between those two would realise, would take into account the special circumstances that I find, namely that there is some hope he would be prepared to undergo alcohol rehabilitation and he should be given some considerable time on parole to enable that to be done.30 I have indicated in the course of argument that I would allow him a discount of twenty percent for his plea at trial. That takes into account the fact that some weeks before the trial he had indicated his preparedness to do this and that may well be a consequence that he is not getting proper advice that he had not pleaded guilty before the Magistrate. Nevertheless, the Court of Criminal Appeal has made it plain that the maximum discount of twenty-five percent should only be given to people who plead guilty at the first opportunity.31 I have decided to give him twenty percent because I think at least he did acknowledge his guilt before the hearing, some considerable public cost has been saved by his doing that and I think he has some genuineness in saying that he wants to do something about rehabilitation. Applying that twenty percent discount and taking off odd portions of months in his favour, that would be then a non-parole period of two years and five months with a total sentence of five years and seven months - I think that is right. No, four years and seven months, not five years and seven months. Now that is greater than his counsel sought that I should impose upon him. I think it takes into account all the factors the prosecutor has raised with me and takes into account all the factors that I think are important to take into account. I have told him already it would be a tragedy if he keeps coming back and that if he keeps coming back he will inevitably become an institutionalised man.32 He strikes me as someone who, on the whole is fairly mild in his temperament and I would have thought he would be a candidate for classification to a lesser form of incarceration than maximum security. He has told me that he is in protection for his own safety and no doubt that would be a matter the authorities would have to take into account.33 The sentence is going to date from 31 July 2006, that is the date on which he was arrested. His parole was revoked and I think it appropriate his sentence should date from the time he was arrested. I have taken that parole into account in any event.34 Now I just ask both lawyers to tell me if I am correctly calculating this.35 RINGBAUER: Your Honour, on my calculations twenty percent from three years comes to two years, 4.8 months and twenty percent off six years comes to 4 years 9.6 months.36 HIS HONOUR: Four years, two years, eight months you say?37 RINGBAUER: Two years, 4.8 months so just over two years and four months.38 HIS HONOUR: Well I calculated it as two years and 5.2 months. So I was going to make it two years and five months. And I calculate the other as four years and 7.6 months and I was going to make it four--39 RINGBAUER: It should be roughly twice the amount. If it was two years five months it should go to then four years and ten months but if - one of the numbers would be out your Honour. I calculate it as 36 months for three years, 8/10 of 36 I calculate as 28.8 which is two years and 4.8 months.40 HIS HONOUR: My calculation is 29.2. Anyhow, I propose to give him two years and five months and a head sentence of four years and seven months. If I am wrong, no doubt someone will tell me. I have indicated the basis on which I have done it. That would go I think from 31 July ’06 to 30 December ’06 if it’s two years and five months is that right? And then from 31 December ’06 to 30 July ’11.41 RINGBAUER: ’08 your Honour.42 HIS HONOUR: Sorry, sorry. 30 - sorry what do you mean ’08? Four years from 30 July ’06. It would be 43 30 December ’08 for the non-parole period, that’s right.44 Because 31 July ’06 for four years is 31 July ‘010 isn’t it?45 RINGBAUER: The four years is, yes your Honour.46 HIS HONOUR: And then you put seven months on that.47 RINGBAUER: That brings you to the end of February, your Honour.48 HIS HONOUR: February?49 RINGBAUER: So it would be the 28th--50 HIS HONOUR: 28 February 2011, is that right?51 RINGBAUER: Yes, on my calculations.52 HIS HONOUR: Now you think that it should be two years and four months rather than two years and five months?53 RINGBAUER: Yes, your Honour.54 HIS HONOUR: Well we could do that. That would be 55 30 November 2008 would it not?56 LALIC: Yes.57 RINGBAUER: Yes, your Honour.58 HIS HONOUR: I don’t propose to change the head sentence, I think four years and seven months is actually less than what you calculated, Mr Ringbauer.59 RINGBAUER: Yes your Honour, yes.60 HIS HONOUR: I sentence the offender as follows.61 The non-parole period commences on 31 July 2006 and concludes on 30 November 2008. He is to be released from custody on that day and I direct that conditions on parole should require him to undertake relapse prevention programs and random urinalysis testing. And I recommend that the parole authorities consider arranging for his admission to a long term rehabilitation program. The balance of the term goes from 31 November 2008 to 28 February 2011 - sorry 1 December. The balance of the term goes from 1 December 2008, there not being any such date as 31 November, to 28 February 2011.62 I recommend that during his period in prison he be placed if suitable on programs dealing with drug and alcohol matters. I recommend that consideration be given to reclassifying him to a lower than maximum security classification as soon as possible.

      REMARKS ON SENTENCE 
       
      
    1 HIDDEN J: The offenders, Mark Edward Norman and Tony Olivieri, stand for sentence, having both been found guilty at trial of the murder of Thomas Williams at Petersham on 6 April 2004. Mr Norman was also found guilty of a charge that in November and December 2003, as a director of a company, he cheated and defrauded Mr Williams in his dealings with that company. This is an offence under s176A of the Crimes Act, carrying a maximum sentence of imprisonment for ten years.  
     
      
       
      Facts 
       
      
    2 The facts of these offences can be stated shortly, but that is not to deny their gravity. The deceased, Mr Williams, was a solicitor, practising from an office in a detached building at his home at Petersham, where he lived with his wife and two young sons. Mr Norman, an accountant, was a director of a company which carried on an accountancy practice at Burwood. Mr Williams was a client of the practice, where his personal and professional tax returns were prepared. The two men had known each other for about ten years and they had been on friendly terms.  
     
      
    3 Early in November 2003, Mr Williams drew a number of cheques on the account of his solicitor’s practice made out to the Taxation Office in amounts totalling roughly $83,500. These were delivered to Mr Norman’s office at Burwood for the purpose of meeting outstanding tax liabilities. In fact, Mr Norman deposited them into a trust account, from which he withdrew the funds over a period of a few weeks thereafter for his own purposes. None of the money found its way to the Taxation Office. This gave rise to the charge of cheating and defrauding. 
     
      
    4 There is no need to go to the detail of what happened thereafter. It is sufficient to say that by the later part of March 2004 Mr Williams had discovered Mr Norman’s fraud and had confronted him about it. It was fear of exposure that led Mr Norman to have Mr Williams killed.  
     
      
    5 It is at this point that Mr Olivieri enters the narrative. He had known Mr Norman for some years and they were friends. He was employed as a maintenance worker on a property in Queensland which was conducted as a racehorse stable, and in which Mr Norman had an interest with his brother. He was living on the property. It was he whom Mr Norman engaged to kill Mr Williams.  
     
      
    6 Mr Norman planned the killing with some care. It is not necessary to examine the detail of the planning, which emerged from the circumstantial case led against the two men. Suffice to say that Mr Norman arranged for Mr Williams to be in his office on the evening he was killed by making an appointment with him which he, Mr Norman, did not intend to keep. Mr Norman sought to distance himself from the killing by arranging a business meeting that same evening at Glenfield, well away from the Petersham area.  
     
      
    7 Mr Olivieri flew from Queensland to Sydney a couple of days before the killing, using a ticket in the name of Grant Norman, Mr Norman’s nephew. He returned to Queensland a couple of days after the killing, this time on a ticket in the name of Mr Norman himself. Clearly, the purpose of this was to conceal the fact that he was in Sydney at the relevant time.  
     
      
    8 In the evening of 6 April Mr Olivieri entered Mr Williams’ office and shot him four times. He sustained one bullet wound to the head and the others to his torso. His wife and children were home at the time. Mrs Williams heard the shots and ran to the office. She saw a man who must have been Mr Olivieri running from the scene, she found her husband, bleeding and close to death, on the office floor, and she raised the alarm. Mr Williams had died by the time ambulance officers arrived. 
     
      
       
      Victim impact statement 
       
      
    9 A victim impact statement by Mrs Williams was read to the court by Ms Bronwyn Gingis, a solicitor who had worked for her husband. It is an eloquent account of the serious and enduring effects of Mr Williams’ untimely death upon her, her children, and the members of Mr Williams’ own family. All of them have lost a loved one in violent circumstances, and Mrs Williams and her children have lost a supportive husband and father. The loss of his support is particularly distressing for Mrs Williams, who came to this country from Japan and has had to adapt to the Australian way of life.  
     
      
    10 I approach that statement in accordance with established authority. Mrs Williams, her children, and the members of Mr Williams’ family have all suffered a tragic and senseless loss. They have my deepest sympathy.  
     
      
       
      Subjective cases 
       
      
    11 Mr Norman is now fifty years old. He has a brief and minor criminal history, which is old and which is of no present significance. He has been in continuous custody in respect of these charges since 17 August 2004.  
     
      
    12 His background is sketched in a psychological report of Mr Sam Borenstein. It is unremarkable and it is not necessary to recite it. He is a member of a large family and appears to have had a satisfactory upbringing. He is married with two adult sons. His wife, his sons, and his siblings are supportive of him. His work history portrays a man who is intelligent, resourceful and industrious.  
     
      
    13 The report provides no insight into his crimes, as he maintains his innocence of them. He denied having been in financial difficulty at the relevant time. Mr Borenstein detected no psychiatric or psychological disorder. 
     
      
    14 Mr Olivieri is now forty-nine years old. He has a fairly lengthy criminal record in New South Wales and Queensland, primarily for drug offences but also for some offences of dishonesty. He has served terms of imprisonment. That said, it contains no entry for violence and I consider it to be of little significance in the present sentencing exercise. He has been in custody in respect of the murder since 3 August 2004.  
     
      
    15 His background also is to be found in a psychological report, in his case by Mr Peter Champion. Like Mr Norman, his upbringing was unremarkable. He was educated to Higher School Certificate level and Mr Champion assessed him to be of average intelligence. He appears to have had a satisfactory employment record, in unskilled or semi-skilled positions. He had had a number of relationships with women, but was not in a relationship at the time of his arrest. He has no children. 
     
      
    16 His criminal record, beginning in his twenties, appears to have revolved around his drug abuse. For some years he was addicted to heroin, although he overcame that through a methadone program. However, he continued a long-standing use of cannabis to the time of his arrest. Given his criminal history, Mr Champion arrived at a provisional diagnosis of personality disorder with anti-social traits. Otherwise, the report discloses no psychiatric or psychological disorder. Like Mr Norman, he maintains his innocence and Mr Champion was unable to proffer any explanation for his involvement in the murder. As will be seen, such explanation as there is emerges from evidence at the trial.  
     
      
       
      Sentencing 
       
      
    17 Clearly, the murder is a particularly serious offence of its class. It was a premeditated killing, planned by Mr Norman and carried out by Mr Olivieri. On Mr Norman’s part, it was not the product of animosity, grievance or vengeance. The man he had killed had been not only a client but also a friend, and his only motive was to conceal his involvement in a serious fraud. Although Mrs Williams gave evidence that she did not know him, he must have been aware that his victim would leave behind a wife and children.  
     
      
    18 While Mr Olivieri does not appear to have played any part in the planning of the murder, he was prepared to assassinate in cold blood a man he did not know and against whom he could not have borne any ill will. On the other hand, there is no evidence that he received any significant reward for his crime. The evidence establishes no more than that Mr Norman paid him some relatively modest amounts for expenses on a few occasions after the killing, but this appears to have been a pattern that had already been in place.  
     
      
    19 Obviously, the question arises whether the crime calls for the imposition of the maximum sentence, imprisonment for the term of the offenders’ natural life. Section 61(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 envisages the imposition of life imprisonment for murder if the sentencing court “is satisfied that the level of culpability in the commission of the offence is so extreme that the community interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence can only be met through the imposition of that sentence”. Although that sub-section is expressed in mandatory terms, it is subject to subs(3), which preserves the discretion to impose a determinate sentence conferred by s21(1). It is now settled that s61 is a statutory expression of the common law: R v Harris (2000) 50 NSWLR 409, per Wood CJ at CL at [79] ff. 
     
      
    20 In R v Chung [1999] NSWCCA 33 at [24] – [26], I had occasion to reflect on what has been described as the “terrible significance” of the life sentence. Sully J agreed with my observations, adding some of his own, at [2]-[4]. It is trite to say that the maximum sentence for any offence is reserved for cases falling within the worst category of that offence, but a particular offence might be placed in that category even though it is possible to envisage a worse case. However, life imprisonment in New South Wales is not like other maximum sentences because it means that the offender has no prospect of release, however distant. Resort to it should be truly exceptional. In many serious cases of murder a lengthy determinate sentence is appropriate and sufficient to meet the demands of retribution and deterrence.  
     
      
    21 A difficulty arises where the person standing for sentence, like these offenders, is at or near middle age. Clearly, the imposition of a determinate sentence which must extend beyond that person’s reasonable life expectancy is pointless. On the other hand, I do not subscribe to an actuarial approach which holds that there is no effective difference between a life sentence and a determinate sentence which would not permit the offender’s release before his or her advanced old age. A sentence which leaves a prospect of eventual release, if the offender lives long enough, is qualitatively different from one which offers no such prospect.  
     
      
    22 I have reviewed decisions of the Court of Criminal Appeal in which the Court affirmed a life sentence, or itself passed a life sentence on a Crown appeal. A number of those cases, including Harris, involved two or more murders. The fact that there were multiple offences was seen as relevant to the offenders’ culpability and to bear upon the appropriateness of the life sentence: Harris at [94] – [95]. (That approach has recently been questioned by McClellan CJ at CL in Aslett v R [2006] NSWCCA 360 at [25], but that is not to the point for present purposes.) 
     
      
    23 For the most part, cases in which the life sentence was affirmed or imposed for one murder only were distressing killings associated with the sexual assault of the victim, such as R v Garforth (CCA, unreported 23 May 1994) and R v Fernando [1999] NSWCCA 66, or cases in which the offender had killed before, such as R v Miles [2002] NSWCCA 276. These were cases in which the victims (in the case of Garforth, a child) were subjected to sustained brutality, or the offenders were seen to pose a continuing danger to society, or both.  
     
      
    24 That said, my attention was drawn to one decision of the Court involving a contract killing: R v Glasby (2000) 115 A Crim R 465. In that case the offender had murdered a man, having been engaged to do so for a large sum of money by the man’s wife. (As it happens, the deceased’s wife was charged with the murder, presumably as an accessory before the fact, but her case did not proceed to trial because of the inadequacy of the evidence admissible against her: Public Trustee v Theissl [1999] NSWSC 708.)  
     
      
    25 Having been found guilty at trial, Sully J sentenced the offender to life imprisonment on the basis that he had been involved in a planned killing for reward, a killing “implemented with both care and persistence”: see the Court’s judgment at [134]. The Court declined to set the sentence aside, concluding that his Honour’s finding was “well and truly available”: [141]. Sully J’s remarks on sentence of 11 June 1998 disclose that the offender had a very bad record, including armed robbery offences for which he had been sentenced to prison terms, and his Honour was pessimistic about his prospects of rehabilitation. 
     
      
    26 In Glasby the Court referred to the decision of Hunt CJ at CL in the notorious case of R v Kalajzich (1997) 94 A Crim R 41. That offender had been sentenced to life imprisonment prior to the enactment of s19A of the Crimes Act, which introduced imprisonment for the term of a person’s natural life. The former Chief Judge was dealing with an application under s13A of the Sentencing Act, 1989, for redetermination of that life sentence. What is significant for present purposes is how his Honour approached a submission by the Crown that he should refuse the application and direct that the offender should never re-apply, on the basis that he should never be released. 
     
      
    27 That offender had been found guilty, as an accessory before the fact, of the murder of his wife. The headnote records that it was a contract killing, “pursued with considerable planning and great persistence and with no regard to the expense involved”. The offender “had used his position of wealth to influence others to assist him in execution of his plans”. Hunt CJ at CL rejected the Crown’s submission, finding that to take that course would be to impose on the offender a more severe punishment than that which could have been imposed upon him when he was originally dealt with. He granted the application and fixed minimum and additional terms.  
     
      
    28 However, his Honour characterised the crime as falling into the worst category of murder and expressed the view that, if the offender had stood for sentence under s19A, a natural life sentence would have been appropriate. That said, his Honour recognised (at 52) that, while any contract killing carries with it the potential to attract the maximum sentence, not every case would call for it. That observation was cited, apparently with approval, by the Court in Glasby at [140].  
     
      
    29 The murder of Mr Williams arose from the circumstances in which Mr Norman found himself and from his relationship with Mr Olivieri. There is nothing to suggest that either man is a continuing threat to society, and I think it most unlikely that either of them would re-offend in this way. Nevertheless, considerations of retribution, punishment and general deterrence loom large, and the combination of those considerations could be enough to warrant the imposition of the maximum sentence: R v Merritt (2004) 59 NSWLR 557, per Wood CJ at [41] – [54].  
     
      
    30 Mr Norman’s liability for the murder, of course, is as an accessory before the fact. That does not make him any less culpable than the principal, Mr Olivieri. Indeed, I consider him to be more so. It was for his benefit that Mr Williams was killed and I have no difficulty inferring that the planning of the murder was his. As I have said, there is no evidence of any significant payment to Mr Olivieri for carrying out the killing. In that sense, this was not a contract killing as that expression is normally understood.  
     
      
    31 It may seem extraordinary that Mr Olivieri would commit such a serious crime, arising from circumstances which did not affect him, without the promise of a substantial reward. However, I can act only on the evidence which I have. That evidence suggests that his relationship with Mr Norman was generally one of dependence, and the only conclusion I can reach is that he did Mr Norman’s bidding out of some kind of misguided loyalty. It may be that his criminal history was part of the reason Mr Norman chose him for this dreadful task.  
     
      
    32 Whether this murder calls for the imposition of the maximum sentence is a difficult question, to which I have given anxious consideration. The question is complicated by my finding that the culpability of the two men is not the same. The cases to which I have referred demonstrate, as one would expect, that the life sentence has been seen to be appropriate in a wide variety of circumstances. The common thread, obviously, is that they were all seen to be particularly heinous crimes. However, a series of cases such as these can provide no more than general guidance to the exercise of discretion in the present case. Glasby and Kalajzich turned on their own facts and are of limited assistance. Every sentencing exercise is unique.  
     
      
    33 In all the circumstances, I am satisfied that the public interest in retribution and deterrence in the present case is met by the imposition of heavy determinate sentences. Those sentences must be such that the offenders will have no prospect of release until they are old men. The standard non-parole period for a murder in the middle range of objective seriousness is twenty years. Clearly, this murder is well above that level of seriousness.  
     
      
    34 The sentences I propose for the murder will reflect the different levels of culpability of the two offenders. Mr Norman’s fraud offence is itself serious and, although it is clearly related to the murder, it calls for a partly cumulative sentence. I shall not fix a non-parole period in respect of that sentence because it will be overtaken by the non-parole period for the murder.  
     
      
    35 I do not find special circumstances in either case. Indeed, in each case the proportion between sentence and non-parole period will be higher than usual because non-parole periods lower than those which I propose would not be adequate to reflect the offenders’ criminality. The sentences will still leave each offender with a substantial period of parole eligibility. In Mr Norman’s case, because of the partial accumulation of the murder sentence upon the fraud sentence, the non-parole period will be a somewhat lesser proportion of the head sentence than in Mr Olivieri’s case.  
     
      
    36 Mark Edward Norman, on the charge of cheating and defrauding as a director you are sentenced to imprisonment for three years, commencing on 17 August 2004 and expiring on 16 August 2007. I decline to set a non-parole period in respect of that sentence. On the charge of murder you are sentenced to imprisonment for thirty-five years, comprising a non-parole period of twenty-nine years, commencing on 17 August 2006 and expiring on 16 August 2035, and a balance of term of six years, commencing on 17 August 2035 and expiring on 16 August 2041. You will be eligible for release on parole on 16 August 2035, just short of your seventy-ninth birthday.  
     
      
    37 Tony Olivieri, on the charge of murder you are sentenced to imprisonment for thirty-three years, comprising a non-parole period of twenty-eight years, commencing on 3 August 2004 and expiring on 2 August 2032, and a balance of term of five years, commencing on 3 August 2032 and expiring on 2 August 2037. You will be eligible for release on parole on 2 August 2032, when you will be seventy-five years old.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 ADAMS J: I agree with the judgment of Howie J and the orders proposed by his Honour.  
     
      
    2 HOWIE J: The applicant was before the District Court for sentence on five counts of indecent assault to which he had earlier pleaded guilty in the Local Court. In addition he asked the sentencing Judge, Berman DCJ, (the Judge) to take into account four other offences of a similar nature on a Form 1. The applicant was sentenced on 17 March 2006 to an overall term of imprisonment of 4 years with a non-parole period of 3 years. The applicant is eligible to be released to parole on 8 March 2009. He seeks leave to appeal against those sentences. 
     
      
    3 The offences were committed over a period of three years from 1979 against the applicant’s stepdaughter. She was aged between six and a half and ten years at the time of the offending. Each of the offences was an indecent assault with a child under 16 years contrary to either s 76 of the Crimes Act, now repealed, or s 61E(1) of that Act. Each carried a maximum penalty of imprisonment for six years. 
     
      
    4 The victim complained to her mother about the applicant’s conduct in 1982. The applicant as a result sought treatment from a psychiatrist and the family remained together for another ten years without any further misconduct by the applicant toward the victim. The victim complained again to a police hotline in 1993 but there was no response. Ultimately she made a complaint in 2005 that resulted in the arrest of the applicant in July of that year. He initially denied the conduct. However, he pleaded guilty before the Local Court and was committed for sentence to the District Court. The Judge gave him the benefit of a discount of sentence of 25 per cent for the utilitarian benefit of the pleas of guilty. 
     
      
    5 The conduct that gave rise to four of the offences for which he was sentenced involved the applicant simulating sexual intercourse with the complainant by rubbing his erect penis between her legs and on her vagina while they were both naked from the waist down. On each occasion he ejaculated but once he was wearing a condom. The fifth offence related to an incident when the applicant fondled the complainant’s vagina beneath her panties while they were in the family vehicle. The offences on the Form 1 involved sexual assaults committed on different occasions and including simulated intercourse without ejaculation, fondling the complainant’s vagina, fondling her breasts, and requiring the complainant to rub cream on his penis. The final assault occurred after the complainant had made complaint to her mother. Throughout the period of the offences the applicant was married to the complainant’s mother and the complainant treated him as her father. After the initial complaint the applicant attended a psychiatrist, Dr Dignam, in 1982 for therapy. He diagnosed the applicant as having an anxiety neurosis and a personality disorder. 
     
      
    6 The applicant was aged 60 years at the date of sentence, having been born on 23 November 1946. He has no criminal record. He was living on the Sunshine Coast in Queensland with his wife and two children. This was his fourth long-term relationship and commenced in 1998. His wife suffers from Sjogrens Syndrome, an autoimmune disease. The applicant is a retired fireman. There was in evidence a pre-sentence report that set out his background. There was little of relevance other than that the applicant stated that his employment as a fireman led to traumatic incidents that resulted in his use of alcohol to cope with stress. This was particularly so after he attended the Luna Park fire in 1978. The applicant was in receipt of a pension and regular payments of compensation from the NSW Fire Service. The applicant expressed remorse for the offending to the officer preparing the report but was unable or unwilling to recall the details of the offences. 
     
      
    7 There was in evidence a report from Dr Westmore, a psychiatrist, dated February 2006. When asked about the offences, the applicant told Dr Westmore that he was drinking heavily at the time and having difficulties with his wife who was too concerned with the problems of her neighbours. He said that the victim would sit on his lap and it led him “to do these things”. The applicant acknowledged that the behaviour was wrong and would have damaged the victim. He said that he did not find her sexually attractive but it was a release for him. The applicant told the psychiatrist that he had been drinking alcohol heavily for about 10 years until he sought counselling and attended AA. He was drinking only lightly at the time of the interview. Dr Westmore diagnosed the applicant as suffering from chronic symptoms of depression at the time of the offending. He did not find him to be a paedophile. He thought his risks of re-offending were negligible to non-existent and his prognosis was generally good. 
     
      
    8 There were letters from the applicant’s present wife and her daughter attesting to his good character. There was a report from a local medical practitioner outlining the condition of the applicant’s wife and expressing the opinion that “it would be catastrophic to her if he was sentenced to custodial imprisonment”. 
     
      
    9 The complainant read to the court a victim impact statement. 
     
      
    10 The Judge was aware of the difficulty in sentencing a person for offences committed many years before the date of sentencing. He was handed relevant authorities including R v Moon (2000) 117 A Crim R 497 and R v MJR (2002) 54 NSWLR 368. Mr Byrne SC, appearing for the applicant, addressed at length on the relevant principles. However, he conceded that the Judge’s discretion was broad and that “it is not a case….where there is any particular disposition that must be resorted to in the circumstances of this case”. However, the submission was made that, had the applicant appeared before a court in 1982, “he would have stood a reasonable chance of obtaining a non-custodial sentence”. 
     
      
    11 In R v MJR this Court was constituted by five Justices in order to determine differing views as to the approach to be taken in a case, such as this, where the offender is being sentenced a long time after the offences were committed. The issue to be decided was whether the sentencing court should take into account the sentencing practice as it was at the date of offending or whether it should sentence according to the practice at the time of sentencing. The Court determined that it should be the former where there was material indicating what that practice was, for example by way of statistical material. However, Sully J, with whom the other members of the Court generally agreed, stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        [107] It is the case, as was frankly conceded by learned counsel for the applicant, that there does not exist a body of statistical material that is relevant to the applicant's case and that is similar in kind and in scope to the body of material, the existence of which was, as I respectfully think, crucial to the reasoning upon which the decision in Shore rests. In the absence of some such acceptable statistical material, this Court is constrained, in my opinion, to take the non-statistical approach which is described as follows by Howie J, (Fitzgerald JA concurring), in his Honour's judgment in Moon [2000] 117 A Crim R 497 at 511 (70), (71). Howie J says, case citations omitted, and I respectfully agree: 
         
          
           
          ""The nature of the criminal conduct proscribed by an offence and the maximum penalty applicable to the offence are crucially important factors in the synthesis which leads to the determination of the sentence to be imposed upon the particular offender for the particular crime committed. Even after taking into account the subjective features of the offender and all the other matters relevant to sentencing, such as individual and general deterrence, the sentence imposed should reflect the objective seriousness of the offence: ..................... , and be proportional to the criminality involved in the offence committed:....................... Whether the sentence to be imposed meets these criteria will be determined principally by a consideration of the nature of the criminal conduct as viewed against the maximum penalty prescribed for the offence. 
          
         
         
          
          When sentencing an offender for offences committed many years earlier and where no sentencing range current at the time of offending can be established, the Court will by approaching the sentencing task in this way effectively sentence the offender in accordance with the policy of the legislature current at the time of offending and consistently with the approach adopted by sentencing courts at that time."" 
          
         
        
       
      
    12 The Judge in his remarks referred to this aspect of the sentencing task and stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “Authority which binds me suggests that I should attempt to determine what the sentencing pattern was for offences such as these in 1982 and sentence the offender accordingly. However, the authorities also recognise the difficulty that the task sometimes presents. There are no sentencing statistics put before me and I was left to rely on cases supplied by Mr Byrne SC who appeared for the offender. It is no criticism of Mr Byrne when I say that those cases did not establish any particular sentencing regime for offences of this nature. The paucity of cases provided by Mr Byrne, the fact that they concern different offences, the fact that the objective circumstances are very different to the present and the fact that they concern offenders with different subjective circumstances together result in a situation where no real assessment can be made as to what the pattern of sentencing was for the offences of this nature and offenders of this nature in 1982. Perhaps the most that can be said is that there was no requirements stated by the Court of Criminal Appeal that offences of this nature must necessarily result in full-time custody. I accept that proposition as a correct statement of the law.” 
        
       
      
    13 The first ground of appeal contends that the Judge failed to apply the principles enunciated in MJR and, in particular, failed to adequately take into account that “it was not necessary in the circumstances of the applicant’s case for a sentence of full-time custody to be imposed”. It seems to me that this argument can only succeed on the basis that the only course open to his Honour was to impose a non-custodial sentence. Otherwise, if it is acknowledged that it was within his Honour’s discretion to impose a custodial sentence, then there is no apparent error in anything the Judge said in the course of his sentencing remarks. 
     
      
    14 I would be prepared to accept that there was no statement of principle from this Court in 1982 that mandated a full-time custodial sentence for all offences of indecent assault against children where there was no penetration of the child: see R v Baxter (NSWCCA, unreported, 26 May 1994). But I am not prepared to accept that it follows that, had the applicant faced the District Court in 1982, “he would have stood a reasonable chance of obtaining a sentence of something less than full-time imprisonment”. That submission is, in my opinion, complete conjecture. But in any event, even if it could be accepted as accurate, it does not necessarily follow that this judge had to impose a non-custodial penalty. These were serious offences of their kind committed in breach of a position of trust with a very young child. They might not have been of the most serious of their kind at the time when they were committed, given that the offence of indecent assault then included acts of penetration, but they were not far below given the age of the child and the nature of the acts committed. 
     
      
    15 The Judge found the motivation for the crimes in what the applicant told Dr Dignam by way of explanation for the offences, being that he was over-sexed and was forced by his wife’s conduct into finding sex elsewhere. He also told the psychiatrist that he wanted to hurt his wife by molesting the daughter. The Judge found this motivation to be an aggravating factor in the offending. These explanations should be compared with what the applicant told Dr Westmore as summarised earlier in this judgment. 
     
      
    16 Ultimately the Judge concluded that a custodial sentence was called for. He stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “There is one fundamental rule of sentencing which applied just as much in 1982 as it does to this day. That is that the sentence imposed must reflect the objective gravity of the offender’s conduct. When I apply this rule to the offences bearing in mind the maximum penalty and the range of conduct covered by the statutory offence I am satisfied that in each case fulltime custody is required……….” 
        
       
      
    17 In my opinion, not only was it open to the Judge to make that finding, but it was the only appropriate finding to be made according to the approach accepted as correct in MJR. I believe that the offences warranted a sentence of full-time custody, whether considered by present sentencing standards or according to the standards in 1982, in order to denounce that type of conduct and for the purposes of general deterrence. The delay before the matters were finally reported to police was regrettable but understandable. It is one of the factors of this type of offending that the child is in the hands of others to take up his or her cause, to vindicate the child’s rights and to redress wrongs committed against the child. The effect of delay upon a particular offender is a relevant factor but it did not justify a non-custodial sentence being imposed upon the applicant. 
     
      
    18 Therefore, I do not believe that the first ground is made out. 
     
      
    19 The second ground of appeal is that the Judge failed to have sufficient regard to the applicant’s subjective case. Such a ground can usually only be determined by an assessment of the sentence imposed. Here it is argued that the Judge concentrated overly on negative aspects of the applicant’s conduct after the complaints were made to the mother and gave insufficient weight to the lack of further offending. 
     
      
    20 The Judge referred to the fact that the applicant was apparently untruthful to Dr Dignam because the applicant led him to believe that there was a single episode of offending 18 months earlier whereas the offending had ceased only two weeks before the applicant saw the psychiatrist. Mr Byrne accepted in this Court that the applicant had not been truthful but it was argued that this was irrelevant in light of the fact that the applicant did admit to offending, did seek treatment and did not re-offend. 
     
      
    21 With respect to the Judge, I do not believe that it was significantly relevant, if relevant at all, that the applicant had lied to the psychiatrist about the timing and nature of his offending in the circumstances of this particular case. The simple fact is that he did do something to address his misconduct and he did not re-offend thereafter. But I do not think that a fair reading of the remarks indicates that the Judge gave undue emphasis to this aspect of the applicant’s conduct in determining the appropriate sentence. The reference to the lies told to the psychiatrist seems largely to have been made as part of the Judge’s recitation of the facts, even though in my view it had no relevance. Later in his remarks the Judge gave due acknowledgment of the lack of further offending. He stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “It is significant that there was a period of ten years in which the complainant and the offender lived together without the offender committing further offences. The offender’s other wives I think have all had children and there is no suggestion that the offender has molested any of them in any way…..” 
        
       
       
      The Judge also referred to the offences as “isolated aberrations in the offender’s otherwise law abiding life”. He noted that the delay since the offences were committed “has enabled the offender to demonstrate rather than just promise rehabilitation”. 
       
      
    22 I do not find that anything in the remarks on sentence indicates that the Judge gave insufficient regard to the applicant’s conduct and rehabilitation after the complaints came to notice in 1982. Whether the sentence imposed reflects that such a deficiency must have occurred is a matter I will consider shortly. 
     
      
    23 The third ground is that the Judge had insufficient regard to the report of Dr Westmore. There is no reference at all in the sentencing remarks to that report or anything that it contained. However, in my opinion, there was little in that report of such importance that a failure to refer to it should be seen as an error in the exercise of the sentencing discretion. There was no suggestion that the applicant was a paedophile and, therefore, Dr Westmore’s finding in that regard was uncontroversial. As I have already noted, the Judge found the offending to be an aberration. Although Dr Westmore concluded that the applicant was depressed at the time of the offending, any weight to be given to that factor was countered by the reasons given by the applicant for committing the offences to Dr Dignam, which were, as the Judge found, matters of aggravation. In any event the offending took place over a considerable period of time and involved multiple acts of serious sexual activity with a young child. Those circumstances seem to indicate to me that less weight should be given to factors such as abuse of alcohol or “turmoil” in the applicant’s life as an explanation for repeated and long term offending. The Judge accepted that the applicant was unlikely to re-offend and that his prospects of rehabilitation were good and these findings were consistent with those made by Dr Westmore. 
     
      
    24 I do not consider that the failure to refer to Dr Westmore’s report, his findings or conclusions indicate that the sentencing discretion miscarried. 
     
      
    25 During submissions to this Court one matter was raised which ultimately resulted in a widening of the attack made upon the sentences imposed than was apparent in the three grounds filed prior to the hearing and which I have so far considered. The Judge had been asked to take into account that remissions would have been available to a person sentenced in 1982. The Judge refused to do so and, after noting that there was no authority on the question binding on him, said: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “If I was sentencing the offender in 1982 I would not take into account his entitlement for remissions. Why should I do so now? 
        
       
      
    26 There was no ground of appeal challenging this approach. However, in considering this issue other questions arose between the bench and counsel about how the Court goes about replicating the practice that existed in 1982 and, in particular, the fact that there is now a statutory regime governing the specification of the non-parole period which requires the finding of special circumstances to reduce a statutory proportionality between the non-parole period and the balance of the term that did not exist in 1982. As a consequence Mr Byrne sought, and was granted, leave to file further grounds of appeal and written submissions in support. 
     
      
    27 The first of the new grounds of appeal was that the sentence was manifestly excessive. It was unusual to say the least that no such ground had initially been relied upon. However that may be, both parties made further submissions to the Court after it reserved its decision. 
     
      
    28 The Judge indicated that he was giving a discount of 25 per cent for the utilitarian value of the plea. The fact that the overall sentence imposed is four years suggests that, without that discount, the overall sentence would have been 5 years and 4 months. Of course one curious result arising from the approach of dealing with the applicant according to sentencing practices that existed in 1982 is that he would not have under that practice received a discount of 25 per cent for his pleas. 
     
      
    29 However, it seems to me, notwithstanding due regard being paid to the discretion of the sentencing judge in a matter that presented no simple task, that such a starting point was manifestly excessive in what was an unusual case. It is not so much the fact that the offences occurred over 24 years ago that seems to place this case into a category of its own, because such delays while uncommon are not unknown, but rather the fact that, the offending having been brought to light, the applicant sought treatment and as a result and, most significantly, did not offend again. Over the period of time since offending the applicant had completely reformed and had moved onto other relationships without any suggestion of any similar conduct reoccurring. There is no error that I can discern in the sentencing remarks so far as the fixing of the overall head sentence is concerned. But it is one of those cases where my immediate reaction to the sentence was that it was too severe, given the delay and the applicant’s reform. Having considered the sentencing remarks in detail and the arguments of counsel before this Court, I am convinced that my immediate reaction was correct. 
     
      
    30 I think that what I said in Moon at [81] is perhaps even more appropriate in the somewhat unusual circumstances of this case: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “…………In a case such as this where there has been such a lengthy delay between offence and sentence and where the offender is rehabilitated, it is the fact of imprisonment rather than the length of the sentence which will be of greatest significance to punish the offender and denounce his conduct. Although general deterrence is important it can never be allowed to dictate a sentence which is not proportionate to the offence committed or appropriate to punish the particular offender before the court.” 
        
       
      
    31 In arguing that the sentence was excessive Mr Byrne raised the issue of whether this Court should take into account in determining what was the appropriate sentence to have been imposed in 1982 and the practices and principles that applied at that time the fact that remissions were then available to prisoners. There are many cases that indicate how the remission system operated and it is fair to say that, had the applicant been sentenced in 1982, he would, in all probability if not certainty, have received the benefit of a reduction of one third of his sentence. At this time remissions only applied to the head sentence and not to the non-parole period; see generally R v Maclay (1990) 19 NSWLR 112 as to the history and application of remissions. But I do not believe that it is appropriate for this Court to try to replicate, not only the sentencing practices of 1982, but also executive practices of that time in respect to the treatment of prisoners. I do not believe that this is what the decision in MJR requires. 
     
      
    32 I do not reach this conclusion for the same reason that the sentencing judge did. It is true that a sentencing court in 1982 did not take into account the existence of remissions, or ought not to have done so: R v O’Brien [1984] 2 NSWLR 449. But this was so that the sentence was not increased in order to counter the fact that remissions applied to it; R v Maclay at 121. Courts rarely take into account executive policy when imposing sentence because it may vary from time to time and the court has no control over it. For this reason a court does not take into account the likelihood that an offender might be deported at the end of the non-parole period. But the policy behind such an approach does not seem to me to be applicable in the situation of the applicant when what is being sought is a reduction in the actual sentence to be served on the basis of executive action that would have occurred had he been sentenced in 1982. However, I do not understand that this Court is required to ensure that the applicant would not have to serve any longer in prison for the offences than if he had been sentenced in 1982. 
     
      
    33 The applicant in Moon raised a similar submission as to the relevance of remissions. It was rejected relying upon what was said in Maclay and the legislative intention behind the Sentencing Act 1989 and the accompanying transitional provisions. In effect it was held that the legislature had made plain that prisoners were not to receive the benefit of remissions after a particular date regardless of when the offences had been committed. This aspect of the decision in Moon was not revisited in MJR. This Court should follow Moon but, in any event, I was a member of that Court and believed then, as I do now, that the reasons given for dismissing that ground of appeal by Whealy J were correct. Although the issue was raised again but not decided in R v Slater [2003] NSWCCA 178, the present facts do not appear to me sufficiently different from those in Moon to justify any different result. There is no decision, to which we were referred, where this Court had taken into account the existence of remissions at the time of the commission of the offences as a mitigating factor. 
     
      
    34 Two further grounds of appeal were raised after the Court reserved relating to the failure of the Judge to find special circumstances to reduce the non-parole period from the statutory norm provided in s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. The basis upon which it is now said that the Judge ought to have found special circumstances arose during argument before this Court and was not canvassed with his Honour. However, that does not mean that this Court should necessarily refuse to consider the argument as there is every likelihood that, had the Judge been given the opportunity to consider the submission, he would have found in favour of it. 
     
      
    35 The Judge applied s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, as he was obliged to do, and determined that there were no special circumstances calling for a reduction in the non-parole period. I am not satisfied that, had he been sentencing the applicant for more recent offences, he could not have come to that decision. Nor am I prepared to find that there were necessarily any special circumstances arising by reason of the subjective case of the applicant, although in R v EGC [2005] NSWCCA 392 this Court found special circumstances in the fact that a custodial sentence was being imposed 16 years after the offending. 
     
      
    36 However, in 1982 there was no provision, such as now exists in s 44, requiring that there be special circumstances before departing from a statutory relationship between the non-parole period and the balance of the term. In 1982 the Parole of Prisoners Act 1966, which was in operation at the relevant time, placed no such restriction on the setting of the non-parole period. The question then arises as to whether the Judge ought to have applied the practice as to the fixing of a non-parole period that was operating in 1982 and which was more liberal than that which exists under present legislation. Such an approach would be consistent with the policy expounded and applied in MJR. However, no consideration was given to this issue in that decision and Sully J, who gave the leading judgment on the disposition of the appeal, considered whether there were special circumstances in fixing the non-parole period and noted that the relationship between the overall sentence and the non-parole period was to be 77 per cent; see [180] point [6]. As I have already noted this Court in EGC also applied s 44 and considered whether there were any special circumstances arising from the subjective case of the applicant. 
     
      
    37 It seems to me that this Court should endeavour to apply the practice that existed in 1982 in specifying a non-parole period because that practice would favour the applicant. It can do so on the basis that special circumstances under s 44 are to be found in the fact that there was a different sentencing practice in relation to fixing a non-parole period in 1982 which did not require a finding of special circumstances in order to avoid a statutory relationship between the non-parole period and the balance of the term. In Tatana v R [2006] NSWCCA 398 it was held that special circumstances could be found in order to overcome unfair disparity between co-offenders that would arise from “a too literal application of conventional sentencing principles and the requirements of s 44”. It is consistent with that approach to find special circumstances in the present case in order to avoid unfairness that would arise by reason of the delay in the prosecution of the current charges as a result of a change in the law in relation to the determination of the appropriate non-parole period. 
     
      
    38 However to determine what the practice was can lead to the difficulties that were referred to by the Chief Justice in R v PLV (2001) 51 NSWLR 736. It is relatively simple to find the applicable statutory scheme that was in operation but it is more difficult to ascertain how it was applied. For example, there was a difference in approach to the Act identified by this Court in R v Portolesi [1972] 1 NSWLR 105 and the High Court in Power v The Queen (1974) 131 CLR 623 which overruled Portolesi. Power makes it clear that the non-parole period is the minimum period to be served by the offender having regard to all the purposes of punishment including deterrence. Power was approved in Deakin v The Queen (1984) 58 ALJR 367. 
     
      
    39 It seems that in 1982 a non-parole period was fixed at somewhere between a third and a half of the term of the sentence. Clearly one consideration in determining that non-parole period was the seriousness of the offence and the requirement of general deterrence. General deterrence was not a significant matter in the applicant’s case because in light of the very lengthy period that had transpired between the offences and the passing of sentence and his reform it was not appropriate to make an example of him to deter others from similar conduct. It seems to me that an appropriate non-parole period would be 18 months because that is in my view the least period that is required to reflect the objective criminality of the offences. 
     
      
    40 In my opinion the application for leave should be granted and the appeal allowed. I propose that the sentences imposed in the District Court be quashed. In lieu the following sentences be imposed: 
     
      
       
        
        (a) In respect of Counts 2 to 5 a sentence of imprisonment for 18 months to date from 9 March 2006 with a non-parole period of 9 months to expire on 8 December 2006. 
        
       
       
        
        (b) Count 1, and taking into account the matters on the form 1, a sentence of 2 years 3 months to date from 9 December 2006 with a non-parole period of 9 months to expire on 8 September 2007 the date upon which the applicant is to be released to parole. 
        
       
      
    41 PRICE J: I agree with Howie J.

    SENTENCE1 HIS HONOUR: I have for sentence before me to day two sisters, Nhu Thi Hong Ho and Thanh Nhu Ho, both of whom attempted to import into Australia a quantity of heroin in identical ways. They were on the same flight from Vietnam landing at Sydney Kingsford Smith International Airport. Both were wearing shoes which contained within them substantial quantities of heroin. Fortunately the drugs were discovered before they could be distributed. I say fortunately because the harm that such drugs cause is notorious, extending beyond the harm caused to users of the drugs, to all members of the community who are affected by crimes committed by those addicted to drugs such as heroin. The offenders both knew that they were bringing some form of drug into Australia. They decided to commit these offences knowing how serious their conduct was and knowing the harm that drugs cause in Australian society.2 The quantity of drug found in the shoes worn by Nhu Thi Hong Ho was 556 grams of heroin. It had a purity of 64.4 percent to 77.7 percent giving a net weight of heroin as 393 grams. In Thanh Nhu Ho’s case the quantity of drug was 596.5 grams with a purity of between 38.6 percent and 43.3 percent giving a net weight of 236 grams. Ms Cook who appeared for both offenders relied on the difference in purity and the slight differences in concealment techniques to indicate that I should accept her clients’ position which was that they did not know what their co-offender and sister was doing until each of them was arrested in Sydney. Upon reflection it is not really a matter I need to determine although it would be a remarkable situation if the version of events that is pressed upon me by Ms Cook were to be the case.3 In both cases the offenders say that they became involved in these offences because of a debt that they owed to a friend of theirs or I should more accurately say, an acquaintance. In one case the debt was $7,000 and in the other case it $7,900.4 Nhu Thinh Hong Ho says that she went to Vietnam to visit her father and once there got a telephone call from the person to whom she owed the debt telling her that the money had to be paid upon her return to Australia. When she said she could not meet that she was then asked to bring in the shoes. When she asked what was hidden in the shoes she was told it was none of her business. She says that she was in a difficult situation because she was pregnant with her child and she had received some threats as to what would happen if she did not bring the shoes back and that these persuaded her that she should do what was asked of her.5 Thanh Nhu Ho gave a slightly different version as to how she got involved. She said she had a gambling debt and when she was asked to repay it she was told that she should, in order to repay the debt, go to Vietnam and bring the shoes back. She did this knowing that there was something like drugs in them.6 Although the evidence is that one of the offenders knew before leaving Australia that she was going to bring heroin back and the other only discovered when she was in Vietnam that she was going to be asked to bring heroin back I do not consider that is a significant factor affecting their criminality. Ms Cook has submitted and the Crown seems to accept that the offenders were mere couriers. There is evidence that they had no ability to obtain supplies of heroin on their own initiative in Vietnam or had a means of distributing it when they got back to Australia.7 Both offenders declined an invitation to assist the authorities. I want to make it quite clear that they are not to be punished for that attitude. In some senses it might be inconsistent with their expressions of remorse at what they have done but they will not receive a longer sentence because they failed to identify the names of those who asked them to become drug importers.8 Both offenders were born in Vietnam and came to Australia some time ago. They were both married and both now have two children. As I indicated Nhu Thinh Hong Ho was pregnant at the time she brought the drugs into Australia. She has now given birth to that child, he is now three months of age. She gave birth to him whilst in custody, was able to spend but twenty-four hours with him before she was returned to custody and Eric was taken away and placed in the care of his father. Both offenders have two children and in both cases the children are in the care of their fathers. Quite understandably both offenders are significantly distressed at being separated from their children.9 Indeed in this afternoon’s hearing a great deal of emotion has been displayed. Diana Nguyen, Thanh Nhu Ho’s twelve year old daughter, gave evidence about her close relationship with her mother and the consequences upon her and her younger brother of being separated from her. Nhu Thinh Hong Ho’s husband gave evidence too about the effect on his children of being separated from their mother. Clearly both offenders will do their time in custody much harder because of the knowledge that through their wrong doing they have been separated from their children. They know their children will suffer, ultimately because they recognise that that is solely due to their misconduct.10 I mentioned that there was a great deal of emotion displayed this afternoon. One has to be careful not to be overwhelmed by it because one thing is undeniable, both offenders knew of the consequences which would befall them if they were detected as being drug importers. They must have known when they agreed to import drugs into Australia that separation from their children was a necessary consequence if they were detected. They nevertheless went ahead and took the risk that they would get away with it. Fortunately for the community they were not successful. The offenders pleaded guilty at an early stage. That indicates a willingness to facilitate the course of justice which will be reflected in a lower sentence than would otherwise be the case.11 Both offenders were of prior good character. Neither of them has any criminal history either in Vietnam or Australia. There are cases which say that less weight should be given to good character where drug couriers are involved because drug couriers are often chosen precisely because they have no prior convictions and are thus more likely to be successful in their endeavours. I interpret those decisions as meaning that one has to be careful when considering the sentences imposed on drug couriers because most of those will be sentences imposed on those with prior good character. I do not interpret those decision as suggesting that little weight should be given to a person’s absence of criminal history.12 Both offenders expressed remorse for what they had done. They both said that they were pleased that the drugs did not get distributed in the community, although it is not surprising that their remorse was almost overwhelmingly concerned with the consequences for their children and themselves at the enforced separation which must continue for some time.13 Both offenders said that they agreed to do what was asked of them because they owed debts. The monies involved were comparatively small although evidence concerning the attitude of those to whom the money was owed suggested that the offenders believed that a refusal to assist them in their importing endeavours would not be looked upon kindly. There were thus pressures on the offenders which may have reduced in probably a small way their ability to resist the requests that were made of them. Often people will get into financial difficulty to people who will ask them to do things to pay off the debt. Often that will involve criminal behaviour. Sentences need to thus contain a considerable deterrent aspect to reinforce the idea that people should not simply succumb to the easy way out when they get into debt because if they do so they will end up with a substantial and sometimes even harsh sentence being imposed upon them.14 Neither offender has any problems with drugs. This is not a case of an offender who needed to support his or her own habit. It is a case where what was sought was the forgiveness of a debt. In a sense therefore these were offences committed by both offenders which were done for money. 15 Ms Cook properly and quite fairly submitted that she could not say that the hardship to either offender’s family was exceptional. This means according to the Court of Criminal Appeal that there cannot be a substantial reduction in sentence because of such hardship. However I am able to take it into account as part of the general subjective facts. I think that that means that I can make an adjustment in the offenders’ favour but not a substantial one.16 I might be forgiven for digressing to say that this is a change in the law, but one which the Court of Criminal Appeal does not appear to have recognised as a change. Nevertheless as the Court of Criminal Appeal decisions currently stand the offender is entitled to a reduction, just not a substantial one because of the hardship to their family members. One of the ways which I will give effect to that is by varying the usual ratio of non-parole period to head sentence in federal matters from the sixty to the sixty-six percent range. The sentence I will impose in each case has a non-parole period which is half that of that of the head sentence. It seems to me that is a permissible way of approaching the idea of giving some leniency to an offender because of hardship while at the same time imposing a sentence which has a substantial head sentence. Ms Cook did not suggest that I should differentiate between either of her clients on sentence, accepting that overall when considering the objective and subjective circumstances of each offender, identical sentences were required.17 Both offenders have difficulties with English. That is another matter which will make their time in custody harder. They will have difficulty communicating with the prison authorities and with other prisoners. Mitigating that fact of course is the fact that they do have the support of each other. There are not too many offenders who have their sisters or a close relative with them in custody but nevertheless because of the language difficulties I accept that their time in custody will be harder and so will impose a lower sentence to reflect that circumstance.18 One matter that I must refer to concerns the prospects of rehabilitation of the offenders. I am satisfied that they are unlikely to commit further offences. Their time in custody will be a salutary lesson for them. They have, as I have mentioned before, no prior offences and I am satisfied that their prospects of rehabilitation are thus good. Both offenders were arrested on 29 September 2006 and so I will impose sentences to commence on that day. In each case I impose a head sentence of six years with a non-parole period of three years. The sentence will commence as I have said on 29 September 2006 and the non-parole period to expire on 28 September 2009.19 I need to explain to you both the sentence that I have just imposed. You will both be kept in custody until at least 28 September 2009. On that day you will be released to parole. When you are released to parole on that day or any day in the future you will still be serving your sentence in the community and you can be returned to custody if you do not comply with the conditions of your parole. You will then continue to serve your sentence until it expires on 28 September 2012.

    SENTENCE1 HIS HONOUR: Gavin McGaw appears for sentence today after having pleaded guilty to five very serious offences. When sentencing him for two of those, the fourth and fifth on the indictment, he asks that I take into account other matters on two separate Forms 1. I will take them into account as indicating a greater need for deterrence and retribution than would otherwise be the case. 2 The relevant events all occurred in the one episode of criminality. It was a period of disgraceful criminality. It involved the abuse of a young man for nothing more than the malicious, gratuitous and cruel enjoyment of a number of people. The young man was abused, and treated as inhuman, with no thought being given to his welfare by those involved, (with one qualification to which I will make reference later on). 3 On the evening of 2 August 2005 the offender was with a number of other young people, the oldest of whom was twenty and the youngest of whom was fourteen. The offender was eighteen himself and he was with his nineteen year old sister as well. 4 This group of people became friendly with a young man by the name of DS. He was only sixteen years of age. He was invited to go to a nearby unit with the group to drink some alcohol that they had agreed to purchase. Once there things were initially friendly and amicable between the group and DS. 5 However, without any apparent reason, a man by the name of Kenneth Dickson, he being the twenty year old, became aggressive. He approached DS and punched him to the face with a closed fist. He fell to the floor and when he tried to get up he was pushed down again. Mr Dickson continued to kick and punch into the complainant, including hitting him in the head. 6 This, not surprisingly, upset DS to the extent that he started to cry. Rather than creating any feelings of empathy on the part of anyone who was there, everyone seems to have almost delighted in the harm that was being caused to him. 7 The youngest of the group, a boy by the name of LK, joined in the assault on DS, punching and kicking him, including while he was on the ground. The offender was one of those who was present and watched what was going on. He watched the complainant cry. He watched the assault upon him but did nothing. 8 DS suffered a number of injuries as a result of this attack upon him. Photographs were tendered before me which show two black eyes, a cut to his eyebrow which required gluing and a number of lacerations as well as swelling. 9 After this assault was completed DS got back up and sat on a chair. He was told to keep his mouth shut and have a few drinks. He was given another drink, but a short time after that Mr Dickson again became aggressive. In fact he said to DS “I’m going to kill you”. 10 LK then told DS to get up and sit on a lounge chair. DS did what he was told but he asked to leave. Mr Dickson, LK and this offender would not allow this to happen. This was the beginning of a period of detention which resulted in the offender being charged with and pleading guilty to, an offence of detaining DS for the purposes of advantage, namely, sexual gratification, while in the company of Mr Dickson and LK immediately before that happening actual bodily harm being occasioned to DS. The injuries that I have referred to also amounted to a wounding but were not the subject of a separate charge. 11 After the detention of DS began LK armed himself with a blue plastic handled knife and fork and he began to stab DS to various parts of his body with these items. Mr Dickson stabbed DS in the head, the leg and the hands with a pair of black handled scissors. Mr Dickson also spat on DS, who put his hands up to defend himself suffering a stabbing to the palm and webbing of his hands as a consequence. 12 Those two attacks by LK and Mr Dickson with those weapons led to the offender being charged with and pleading guilty to an offence of malicious wounding of DS whilst in the company of Kenneth Dickson and LK on the basis that he was a participant in a joint enterprise with them, even though he himself did not actually use any of those weapons upon DS. 13 What was happening at the time that the unfortunate DS was being stabbed was that this offender, far from intervening, far from attempting to protect DS, watched and laughed as DS was repeatedly stabbed. DS constantly asked for the attacks upon him to stop but his requests were in vain. 14 It seems that the group were not satisfied with the indignity and terror they had inflicted upon DS because at this stage Mr Dickson said to LK that they were going to kill DS. LK said to DS “You’re going to be dead at the end of this night”. 15 The statement of facts records that upon hearing this DS became paralysed with fear, too scared to move. That response is entirely understandable. One can all too easily understand the terror that he must have felt upon hearing those words. He begged to be let go. He begged Mr Dickson. He begged LK and most relevantly for the purposes of sentencing Mr McGaw, he begged this offender also, but they all refused. 16 It is not quite accurate to say that they refused completely, because in response to the request to be let go, Mr Dickson said “Suck my penis and then we will let you go”. DS refused, but he was then made to lick and kiss the exposed penis and testicles, not only of Mr Dickson but also this offender. They took their clothing down to expose their genitals and forced the complainant to undergo the indignity of having to lick and kiss their genitals. If that was not bad enough, whilst he was being forced to do this both Mr Dickson and the accused spat on him, called him names and giggled. 17 The complainant was then made to kiss Jessica McGaw on the outside of her underpants in the vaginal area. Those three acts whereby DS was forced to lick and kiss the genitals of Mr Dickson and the offender, and to kiss the vaginal area of Ms McGaw, have led to the offender being charged with and pleading guilty to: inciting DS to commit an act of indecency upon Kenneth Dickson, DS being sixteen years of age; incite DS to commit an act of indecency upon the offender himself, DS being sixteen years of age; and also one of the Form 1 matters. 18 What I have recited is bad enough but it even gets worse. Although he had been told that he would be released if he performed the indignities I have described, of course he was not let go at all. He was made to remove his pants and underpants and to bend over a two seater lounge. Mr Dickson and LK seemed to be the prime motivators in doing what came next. LK obtained a wooden rolling pin. He obtained some sort of lubricant which he squirted into the hands of the complainant, DS, telling him to rub the cream between the cheeks of his bottom. 19 The complainant complied with these demands because he was told that if he did not do what was required of him he would have his throat slit with the scissors. DS did what he was told. LK hit DS on the head three times with the rolling pin. DS tried to see what was happening to him but every time he did he was hit again. The offender joined in by telling DS what it was that LK was using to hit him. 20 Then LK forced the rolling pin into the anus of DS. Not in a gentle manner but in a way that was seemingly designed to maximise the pain, suffering and injury that would result. He used the sole of his foot to force the rolling pin into DS’s anus, kicking it into him. He did this about three times. Of course this caused DS great pain and he begged LK to stop, screaming out in pain. 21 The offender aided and abetted what Mr Dickson and LK were doing and so he pleaded guilty to an offence of aiding and abetting the offences committed by Mr Dickson and LK that is whilst in the company of each other having sexual intercourse without DS knowing that he was not consenting. 22 Mr Dickson also took the rolling pin from LK and he began forcing the rolling pin into the anus of DS. That has led to the other matter on the Form 1. Again it seems far from doing anything to stop what happened the offender joined in, he assisted through his presence the commission of that offence. DS knew that the offender was nearby and he could hear laughter from other people while he was subject to this grave indignity. 23 Of course he asked for the assaults to stop and of course he asked to be allowed to leave, but of course his pleas were ignored. Eventually the assault with the rolling pin did stop. He turned around and saw that the rolling pin was on the ground covered with blood. The group simply sat around drinking. He was told not to pull his pants up and he was too scared to say or do anything. At this stage it appears that the offender did something that he should have done much earlier. He said to Mr Dickson who appears to have been with LK the leader of the group that they should let DS go. 24 Mr Dickson told the offender that if they did that then DS would go to the police and a fight between the offender and Mr Dickson arose. The offender was punched by Mr Dickson on more than one occasion. At about 2 o’clock in the morning LK took DS to the rear yard of the premises. DS, not surprisingly, thought that his life was about to end. When LK was distracted by urinating he jumped the fence and ran away. 25 He came across a stranger who saw that his face was covered in blood and asked if he was all right. She contacted 000. DS, in fear, ran away but he was located a short distance away trying to get help from local residents and was taken to Nepean Hospital where he was treated and admitted due to his injuries. He suffered a number of wounds and a number of other injuries. Photographs I have mentioned show the extent of some of those injuries. What is not described is any injuries to DS’s rectal area because an examination of that area was not conducted. He required stitches and treatment and dressing of other wounds.26 I have taken a lengthy time to set out the history of what the offender did. This would be one of the most serious examples of criminal activity. There was a sixteen year old held for the evil gratification of others who, as I mentioned earlier in these remarks on sentence, must have cared nothing for DS as a human being, but regarded him merely as a plaything to be tortured for their own pleasure. 27 The offender, I am satisfied, recognises now how wrong his conduct was. He read to me in evidence today a statement that he had written out. I am satisfied that he is remorseful for what he has done. It is consistent with his attitude that he displayed towards the end of the events of the evening I have described when he, and he alone it seems, made an effort to have DS released. This remorse however was belatedly arrived at, only after the offender had committed those serious offences which I have set out. 28 He is now nineteen years of age. He had what was described as a dysfunctional upbringing. It was certainly difficult. He was exposed as he grew up to drug use, to anti-social behaviour and a psychologist who provided a report suggested that in those circumstances he would have regarded such behaviour as the norm. However it has to be said that even a person brought up in the conditions that Mr McGaw was, would know, and know full well, just how wrong it was to treat DS as he was treated that evening. 29 The offender has a criminal history but this is his first time in gaol. He has committed no earlier offences remotely approaching the gravity of these present offences.30 Let me deal now with a specific issue. Count 5 on the indictment is, as I have said, an offence of aiding and abetting an aggravated sexual assault. I was told that that carried with it a standard non-parole period of ten years. I confess to having some doubts as to whether that is the case. The offence is described in the table to s 54D of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act as aggravated sexual assault. That may be a shorthand expression intended to cover aiding and abetting an aggravated sexual assault. However, I do note that it was the crown submission and Mr Hancock accepted, that the standard non-parole period would apply to an offence of aiding and abetting an aggravated sexual assault. However, of course, in this case the standard non-parole period is not of direct application because Mr McGaw pleaded guilty to count 5 on the indictment. The standard non-parole period nevertheless remains as a guide post to the appropriate non-parole period in the present case. Although the offence itself was an offence which I am satisfied was above the middle range in its objective gravity, the fact that the offender was an aider and abetter rather than a principal means that the objective gravity of the offender’s conduct was below the middle range of objective criminality of offences covered by the standard non-parole period. The offences are aggravated by the circumstance that they involve gratuitous cruelty. That includes those threats to DS in which he was told that he would be killed. They also include the way in which the sexual assault, the subject of count 5 was carried out. Although the penetration of DS’s anus with an object is an element of the offence, and thus it would be wrong for me to take that into account as a circumstance of aggravation, the particular manner in which the rolling pin was used, is such that I am satisfied that it did involve gratuitous cruelty and the particular manner of its use does thus amount to an aggravating circumstance which I will take into account. 31 I turn now to those matters of most assistance to the offender. It is to be noted that as far as I can determine, he was a follower rather than a leader this evening. As I have said, Mr Dickson and LK were the ones who seem to have decided what would happen to DS, and it was they who actually inflicted most of the harm upon DS.32 The offender has not only pleaded guilty but offered to assist the authorities. I have read material relating to that issue and I am satisfied that the offender’s assistance will be of considerable value. Already one of the others involved has pleaded guilty but three trials remain. The offender’s assistance extends to him undertaking to give evidence for the prosecution in those three trials. That evidence will provide valuable and substantial support for the evidence of DS. I assess the value of Mr McGaw’s assistance quite highly. His assistance will also have the consequence that there is at least a risk that he will do his time in custody harder because of his cooperation with the authorities. Nor is this a matter which will be capable of being kept quiet. The three offenders against whom this offender will be giving evidence will know very shortly, if they do not already, of the offender’s cooperation with the authorities. His assistance is also further evidence of his remorse and the extent of the remorse he feels for what he has done. It is one matter as the offender did, to come into the witness box and express his sorrow, but it is another matter, and a further step which the offender has taken, to demonstrate that remorse by offering to give assistance and by offering to give evidence against others involved in this disgraceful episode.33 I will not quantify the discount I have allowed for the plea of guilty separately from the discount I will allow for the combination of the assistance and the plea of guilty. I note that it was a late plea of guilty and so the discount I have allowed for assistance and the plea of guilty is forty percent.34 These offences all occurred over the one course of criminal conduct but that does not mean that the offender should receive no extra punishment for his separate and individual acts of criminality. I am satisfied that it would be quite wrong to ignore the fact that the offender committed multiple acts of criminality: Five separate offences on the indictment and two on separate Forms 1. The fact that the offender has performed separate acts of criminality will be reflected in the partial accumulation that I have allowed for all five offences. 35 The offender is but nineteen years of age. There are principles which I must follow if I were to be sentencing the offender as a seventeen year old. Those principles do not fall by the wayside as soon as the offender reaches his eighteenth birthday. The developing maturity of a human being is a continuum rather than a bright line, and so I will take into account in the offender’s favour that he was more easily led than he would have been at an older age, and there are good prospects of rehabilitation which effect the sentence I will shortly announce on the offender. It will be substantially less than it would have been if the offender were an older man.36 Mr Hancock asked me to find special circumstances in this case. I will do so. They relate to the offender’s youth, that this is his first time in custody, and that he has good prospects of rehabilitation. He will be assisted, and so the community will benefit, upon his release from custody for an extended period of supervision on parole. The sentences are as follows:37 Count 1 on the indictment I sentence the offender to a fixed term of one year to date from 12 August 2005.38 On count 3 on the indictment I sentence the offender to imprisonment for a fixed term of one year to date from 12 February 2006.39 On count 4 on the indictment the offender is sentenced to imprisonment for a fixed term of one year to date from 12 August 2006. Those are fixed terms because of other sentences I will shortly announce.40 On count 5 of the indictment I set a non-parole period of eighteen months with a head sentence of three years to date from 12 February 2007.41 On count 2 of the indictment I set a non-parole period of one year with a head sentence of three years to date from 12 August 2007.42 The non-parole periods of counts 5 and 2 will thus expire on 11 August 2008 on which day the offender is eligible to be released to parole. Those sentences on counts 4 and 5 are taking into account the matters on the Forms 1.

    2 SULLY J: I agree with Howie J. 
     
      
    3 HOWIE J: This is an appeal by the Crown pursuant to s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 in respect of sentences imposed by Sides DCJ (the Judge). The respondent was before the court having pleaded guilty to three offences arising from two separate incidents. The offences occurred in 1999 but the respondent absconded on bail and did not return to Australia until early 2006. The respondent pleaded guilty in May and June of that year and was sentenced on 24 July 2006. The Crown did not appeal until 29 September 2006 and an earlier letter advising that the Crown was considering an appeal was not delivered to the respondent in prison because of an administrative problem in the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions. 
     
      
    4 The first two offences to which the respondent pleaded guilty in the District Court occurred in February 1999. They involved a kidnapping contrary to s 90A of the Crimes Act (now repealed) and an offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. The kidnapping offence carried a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 20 years unless the court was satisfied that the victim was released without substantial injury, in which case the maximum penalty was imprisonment for 14 years. The assault offence carried a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 5 years. The third offence, to which the respondent pleaded guilty in the Local Court and was committed for sentence to the District Court, was an offence contrary to s 35 of the Crimes Act being maliciously inflict grievous bodily harm. That offence carried a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 7 years. 
     
      
    5 In respect of the s 35 offence the Judge sentenced the respondent to imprisonment for 16 months with a non-parole period of 8 months to date from 3 February 2006. For the kidnapping offence the Judge sentenced the respondent to imprisonment for 2 years 6 months with a non-parole period of 12 months to date from 3 August 2006. For the assault offence the Judge imposed a fixed term of 6 months to be served from 3 August 2006. The overall sentence imposed was, therefore, one of imprisonment for 3 years with a non-parole period of 18 months to expire on 2 August 2007, the date upon which the respondent is to be released to parole. 
     
      
       
        
        The facts 
        
       
      
    6 The Judge determined the facts of the offences occurring in February 1999 after a hearing in which the complainant, the respondent and his wife gave evidence. Although the respondent pleaded guilty to the kidnapping and the assault offences, he disputed much of the complainant’s allegations. The Judge decided the facts contrary to the evidence given by the respondent and his wife. The complainant was aged 14 years at the time of the offences and had run away from home. She met the co-offender, a juvenile named Khadour, and a man named Leon. Eventually she began working as a prostitute. Leon took her to premises in Greenacre where the respondent’s wife lived, the respondent residing with his parents a short distance away. The respondent permitted the complainant to live in a spare room of the Greenacre house on a few occasions. 
     
      
    7 On 13 February 1999 the complainant was plying her trade when police arrested her. She provided her residential address as that of the premises in Greenacre and the police took her to that address which they searched. She was granted bail to live with her grandmother, but left those premises. By chance she met the respondent and was taken to the Greenacre house. She was threatened with a flick knife and told to go to the rear yard where she was chained to a brick pier under the veranda and secured by a padlock. The respondent produced a rifle, loaded it and gave it to Khadour telling him to shoot her if she moved. When the respondent left to answer a mobile phone, Khadour obtained a baseball bat and struck the complainant to a shin and one of her elbows. 
     
      
    8 After a short time the respondent returned, undid the chain and dragged the victim a short distance onto some grass where he kicked and stomped on her head. She was then taken into a toilet in the house and punched to the face a few times causing her to bleed. She was then placed in a bedroom and directed to write down what she had told the police. Eventually the complaint made her escape from the house and went to a neighbour’s premises from where the police were summoned. As a result of the assaults the complainant suffered bruising to her right cheek, a black eye, tenderness over the nasal bridge, slight tenderness to the scalp, tenderness to her neck and bruising over her right tibia. 
     
      
    9 The respondent gave evidence at the sentencing hearing that he never padlocked the chain, never had a rifle and never assaulted the complainant after releasing her from the chain. The Judge disbelieved the evidence. He concluded that the complainant was detained for about 16 hours and that during this period she was in great fear of her safety. The Judge found that she did not suffer substantial injuries. 
     
      
    10 The infliction of grievous bodily harm offence occurred on 10 September 1999 while the respondent was on bail for the February offences. In brief an incident arose between the respondent, who was the driver of a motor vehicle, and the victim, who was a passenger in another vehicle. The respondent’s vehicle stopped diagonally across two lanes impeding the other vehicle. The driver of that vehicle, the victim’s wife, sounded her horn but the offender failed to move his vehicle. The victim, a man of sixty-six, got out and approached the front passenger’s door of the respondent’s vehicle. He asked the respondent’s wife to move the vehicle. When there was no response, he opened the door. The respondent had, however, alighted from the vehicle and advanced behind the victim. He struck him twice to the head with a hammer causing the victim to fall to the ground. The respondent continued to strike the victim. The respondent’s wife drove the vehicle around the corner where he entered it and they drove away. The victim suffered two lacerations to the scalp and a laceration to the forehead all of which required suturing. 
     
      
    11 Again the respondent disputed the facts of this offence and he and his wife gave evidence before the Judge. The victim could not be found but the Judge relied upon the statements of him and his wife. The respondent gave an account to the effect that he acted in self-defence after the victim attacked him by grabbing his throat. He gave evidence that, despite his plea of guilty, he felt he was justified in what he did. The Judge did not believe the account given by the respondent and his wife. 
     
      
       
        
        The respondent’s subjective case 
        
       
      
    12 The respondent was aged 21 at the time of the offences. The Judge in his sentencing remarks mistakenly stated that he was 18 at the date of the kidnapping offence. He was granted bail in respect of the s 35 offence and left the country with his wife in October 1999. He claimed that police were unfairly harassing him. He went to Lebanon and then in December 2000 travelled to New Zealand where he remained until returning to Australia in February 2006. He worked there as a law enforcement officer for a local council, then in the security industry and finally as a corrections officer. He intended to return to New Zealand and had taken 12 months leave from his work there. He had been married for about nine years and had two children aged three and six. 
     
      
    13 The respondent had a criminal record commencing in 1996 when he was fined for cultivation of a prohibited plant. He was placed on a community service order for receiving offences in October 1996 but breached the order and was sentenced to a term of periodic detention. At the time of the kidnap offence he was on bail for offences of resisting a police officer and using offensive language. He failed to appear at the hearing of those matters and they were dealt with ultimately in August 2006 after he had been sentenced for the present offences. 
     
      
    14 A pre-sentence report indicated that the respondent enjoyed a close and supportive relationship with his family. He had abused alcohol, cannabis and rohypnol during the period 1996 to 1999. He did not receive any professional help but went overseas for a “fresh start”. He maintained that he had not used any illegal drugs since 1999. He described his offending as “stupid” and said that at the time he was using drugs and mixing with a negative peer group. It was considered that the respondent had no issues that needed to be addressed by the Probation and Parole Service. 
     
      
       
        
        The Crown’s submissions 
        
       
      
    15 The Crown complains that the sentence for the kidnapping offence is manifestly inadequate particularly as the respondent was on bail when he committed that offence. It was argued in written submissions that the sentences would have been within range had the respondent pleaded guilty in the Local Court but the Crown withdrew that submission during oral argument. The Crown submitted that the Judge erred by determining that the sentence for the assault offence be served concurrently with the sentence for the kidnapping. 
     
      
    16 The Crown argued that the Judge erred in making the sentence for the inflict grievous bodily harm offence partially concurrent with the kidnapping offence in light of the fact that it was a completely separate offence of violence committed while the respondent was on bail for the earlier offences. 
     
      
    17 The Crown submitted that the Judge inappropriately dealt with the fact that the respondent had returned to Australia and handed himself into police. The Judge said: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “The Court extended leniency for the Offender’s co-operation with the authorities by voluntarily returning to Australia and surrendering. In doing so it took into account the matters set out in s 23 [of the  
        Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 
        ].” 
        
       
      
    18 It was the Crown’s contention that the Judge had placed too much weight on the respondent’s rehabilitation in light of the fact that it was achieved by fleeing the country in breach of bail and returning over six years later when it suited him. 
     
      
    19 The Crown submitted that the Judge erred in determining the overall non-parole period. The Judge found special circumstances by reason of the fact that he was accumulating the kidnapping and assault offence with the inflict grievous bodily harm offence by six months but then reduced the non-parole period by nine months from the period that would have applied by operation of the statutory proportion. In other words by extending the overall sentence by six months the Judge reduced the non-parole period by nine months. 
     
      
       
        
        The respondent’s submissions 
        
       
      
    20 Mr Dhanji, who appeared for the respondent, submitted that there was no error apparent in the sentencing remarks and that the sentences were determined in an appropriate exercise of the Judge’s discretion. It was argued that they could not individually or in the overall be said to be unreasonable or plainly unjust. The Court was reminded of the principles that govern the approach to Crown appeals both in determining whether a sentence was manifestly inadequate and in the exercise of the discretion whether to intervene. In written submissions he quoted from R v Wall [2002] NSWCCA 42 at [70] where those principles are gathered together. 
     
      
    21 He relied upon the principle of parity in relation to the sentence imposed for the kidnapping offence with the co-offender, Khadour, who had been dealt with according to law, notwithstanding that he was a juvenile, and sentenced by Judge Tupman to imprisonment for 2 years with a non-parole period of 9 months. Unfortunately the sentencing remarks are no longer available and, therefore, the facts upon which he was sentenced cannot be ascertained. The Judge in sentencing the respondent referred to the need to achieve parity with the co-offender notwithstanding clear differences between them including their ages and the differing subjective features. Mr Dhanji warned this Court against creating disparity by re-sentencing the respondent. 
     
      
    22 Mr Dhanji submitted that there was no error in the Judge taking into account the fact that the respondent returned to Australia and surrendered himself to police. In that regard he referred to the decision of the High Court in AB v The Queen (1999) 198 CLR 111 where it was held that the applicant was entitled to have taken into account that he had not opposed his extradition to Australia to face charges from which he had fled. 
     
      
    23 Finally the Court was asked to consider in the exercise of its discretion the delay in the lodging of the Crown appeal, a period of about two months, and the absence of any indication to the respondent that an appeal was being considered: see R v Bardo (NSWCCA, unreported, 14 July 1992) and R v Pham (1991) 55 A Crim R 128. In this regard reliance was placed upon an affidavit of the respondent where he states that he was surprised when he was notified of the appeal as he believed the proceedings were completed. 
     
      
       
        
        Did the Judge err? 
        
       
      
    24 An important consideration in sentencing the respondent was clearly the fact that he had absented himself for over 6 years before returning to Australia to face these charges. Such a situation leads to the difficulty that, on the one hand, the court was to sentence the respondent as he stood before it, a rehabilitated man, but, on the other hand, the court could not grant the respondent the full benefit of the advantages he had gained by absconding on bail. The court could not allow the public in general to understand that an offender can put himself in a more favourable position by breaching his bail than would have been the position had he complied with his bail undertaking and stood for sentence nearer the commission of the offence. 
     
      
    25 In such a situation as confronted the Judge, there are conflicting public policy considerations that can only be resolved on a case by case basis. But generally the balance must come down heavily in favour of the protection of the criminal justice system from manipulation by an offender such as the respondent. This is particularly so where the offence involves personal violence against an individual in the community who has a real interest in the matter being dealt with to completion as quickly as possible. In the present case the effects of the offence upon the victim of the kidnapping were aggravated by the respondent fleeing the jurisdiction and her being required to give evidence of the offence so many years after its commission. This is not to suggest that the respondent is to be punished for absconding on bail. There is an offence under the Bail Act with which the respondent could have been charged for failing to appear: see s 51. But he cannot receive the full measure of any advantages he may have gained by failing to comply with his bail undertakings. 
     
      
    26 Throughout the sentencing remarks there is not the slightest evidence of an appreciation of the fact that the weight to be given to subjective matters in the respondent’s case had to be substantially reduced by the fact that they had been earned by his absconding and remaining out of the jurisdiction for such a lengthy period. Rather there are examples of the respondent being rewarded for the results of his absconding on bail. 
     
      
    27 The most obvious example in this regard is to be seen in the Judge granting the respondent the benefit of leniency under s 23 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act; that is for assistance to the authorities. The Judge, for reasons that I do not understand, was chary of indicating any discounts given, even for the utilitarian value of the plea to the s 35 offence in the Local Court. So he did not indicate the degree to which leniency under s 23 figured in the process of deriving the sentences he imposed. But whatever it was, there was no justification for considering his surrender to police as a discrete factor warranting any reduction in the sentences. The use of the section was in my view completely inappropriate and counsel for the respondent did not seek to justify it before us. 
     
      
    28 As I have noted, the respondent relied upon AB v The Queen to support the proposition that the respondent was entitled to a significant degree of mitigation for returning to Australia and surrendering to police. But in AB the offender had fled before being charged. He was legally entitled to do so. There was no countervailing public policy in permitting him credit for not opposing his extradition to face the charges for which he was sentenced. That is not the situation here. I believe that the respondent’s surrender to police was relevant only to the extent that it might impact upon an assessment of his contrition. 
     
      
    29 In the present matter the Judge found that the respondent was contrite. That is a somewhat surprising finding in view of the fact that he challenged most of the facts of the kidnapping offence including his use of a knife and rifle, refused to acknowledge that he had injured the complainant and believed that he was fully entitled to strike a sixty-six year old unarmed man with a hammer to the head. The Judge found that he and his wife had lied to minimise the criminality of the offences, a finding inconsistent with the respondent being fully contrite for what he had done. In that regard the Judge said about the kidnapping offence: 
     
      
       
        
         
        The Court gained the distinct impression that the Offender was doing his best to minimise his involvement in these offences and falsely passed them off as a bit of juvenile horseplay. 
        
       
      
    30 In any event, contrition has little value by itself and does not alone justify leniency: see R v MAK and MSK [2006] NSWCCA 381. If the Judge had based his finding that the respondent was unlikely to offend on the basis of contrition alone such a finding would not have been open to him. In my view contrition had little role to play in this case. Favourable findings as to re-offending and reform arose chiefly from the fact that apparently the respondent had not committed any offences in the more than six years since the offending. 
     
      
    31 The Judge also erred in his approach to the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty to the kidnapping and assault offences. The Judge held that there was “some limited utility value” in the pleas of guilty to those offences. He then went on: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “In assessing the leniency, based on the utility, the Court took into account the age of the matter and the difficulties prosecuting authorities experience in presenting cases after such delay. However, the parties did not present any material from which the Court could assess the strength of the prosecution case.” 
        
       
      
    32 Two comments can be made about this passage. Firstly I have difficulty in understanding how an offender could receive any advantage from delay or the effects of it on the prosecution of the offence when he was responsible for bringing about that delay by fleeing the jurisdiction. The respondent was again being rewarded for his misconduct. Secondly, with respect, the Judge has completely misconceived what are relevant factors in assessing the utilitarian value of a plea. It has nothing to do with the ability of the prosecution to prove the charge. The error in the Judge’s approach is made obvious by the reference to the strength of the prosecution case, a matter that is irrelevant to a consideration of the utilitarian value of a plea: R v Sutton [2004] NSWCCA 225. The matters to which the Judge was referring might be relevant to contrition but provided the respondent no other advantage. The utilitarian value of the pleas in the kidnapping and assault offences in this case could only be the saving of time, effort and expense of a trial but that was offset by the fact that there was a two-day hearing of evidence on the plea. In my view the utilitarian value could not have exceeded 10 per cent. 
     
      
    33 The Judge clearly took into account to a very significant degree that the respondent had been fully rehabilitated in the period since the offence. That was a relevant matter but it could not be given the importance that it might have been accorded if the offender had not fled the jurisdiction and remained abroad for so long. In R v Thompson (1987) 37 A Crim R 97 Street CJ stated after referring to aspects of the respondent’s rehabilitation: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “The balance against those considerations is undoubtedly the circumstance that the respondent has now made an effort to rehabilitate himself, an effort that has been attended by some success. He cannot, however, claim the full benefit of this in as much as the freedom he used in order to rehabilitate himself was freedom that flowed from his having absconded from bail. It would be an undesirable precedent to encourage persons to abscond from bail and rehabilitate themselves and then come forward and seek to have that taken into account significantly when they stand for sentence. Rehabilitation already accomplished will, of course, always be taken into account however it may have arisen but, when it has arisen through self taken liberty by a bail absconder, it will be given less significance than if it has taken place simply in the ordinary passage of time."" 
        
       
       
      See also  
      R v Shore 
       (1992) 66 A Crim R 37. 
       
      
    34 Clearly the Judge was entitled to take into account that the offender had aged and presumably matured and that there was now no need for personal deterrence notwithstanding that the offences were committed while the respondent was on bail. He was also entitled to take into account that the respondent was no longer misusing drugs or alcohol. However, the Judge should have tempered the weight to be accorded to the respondent’s rehabilitation and neither the remarks or the sentences imposed reveals that he did. 
     
      
    35 The Judge made the sentence for the assault offence completely concurrent with the kidnapping offence. This was on the basis that “the assault offence was part of the detention and designed to heighten the victim’s state of fear”. He went on: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “Thus the requirement that the Court consider the two February offences separately involves a considerable degree of artificiality.” 
        
       
      
    36 With respect I do not understand that comment. The assault with the knife and the rifle certainly were part of the detaining and intended to frighten the respondent into making her more compliant. But it is one thing to detain a person and incidentally assault her in bringing about that detention, however it is quite another to intentionally beat the detainee in order to force her to carry out some task during the detention. The assaults to the victim, particularly in the house, were designed to obtain from her a written account of what she told the police. I doubt that it was open to the Judge to take into account the infliction of injuries to the victim as part of the kidnapping once he had found that she was released without being substantially injured. But in my opinion the Judge should have imposed an additional punishment for the infliction of injuries by the assaults over and above the punishment for the detention. 
     
      
    37 It was also, in my view, an error of principle for the Judge to determine to make the sentence for the s 35 offence partially accumulative with the kidnapping. The Judge acknowledged it was a separate act of criminality from the earlier offences: it was committed some six months after the kidnapping offence. The Judge had also noted that it was committed while the respondent was on bail for the earlier offences. In those circumstances I fail to understand how the principle of totality required only partial accumulation between the sentences and then by only six months. I can only suspect that the Judge took into account the delay in sentencing, but, if he did, this was an erroneous approach in the circumstances of this case. 
     
      
    38 Finally the Judge was in error in the method by which he determined the non-parole period. Having considered that there should be some accumulation between the kidnapping sentence and that for the s 35 offence, the Judge said: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “Because of the accumulation it is appropriate to find special circumstances” 
        
       
       
      As has already been noted, the consequence of the approach he took was that, by extending the overall head sentence by six months, he reduced the non-parole period by nine months. It can only be assumed that the Judge did not intend such a result. 
       
      
    39 The finding of special circumstances only because of the accumulation of sentences is made to ensure a proper relationship between the overall head sentence and the overall non-parole period: R v Simpson (1992) 61 A Crim R 58. The finding is normally made to ensure that the statutory proportion is retained. If some reduction is not made to the non-parole period of the last sentence imposed, the result will be that the overall non-parole period will approach too closely to the overall head sentence. I do not understand that there could be any other reason for finding special circumstances where accumulating sentences in the present case. The Probation and Parole Service did not believe that there was any issue that the Service needed to address or for which it could assist the respondent. The Judge in the present case reduced the non-parole period for both the kidnapping and the s 35 offences, yet there was no legitimate reason to do so. 
     
      
    40 In my opinion the discretion of the sentencing Judge clearly miscarried in a number of respects and the result was the imposition of sentences that were individually and in the overall manifestly inadequate to a very significant degree. I do not believe that there is any need to significantly moderate the kidnapping sentence in order to reflect parity with the co-offender because there were so many obvious differences between their respective criminality and subjective circumstances. The Crown conceded that the sentence for the s 35 offence was within the available range, but I do not believe that concession should have been made. A sentence of sixteen months for an assault of that nature by a person on bail for offences of violence was manifestly inadequate whatever was the discount given by the Judge for the plea. But in light of the Crown’s concession I would not interfere with that sentence as a matter of discretion. The Crown withdrew its concession that the sentence for the kidnapping would have been within range had there been a plea in the Local Court. With respect, that concession also should never have been made because even with a discount of 25 per cent the sentence was clearly manifestly inadequate to reflect the objective circumstances of the offence committed while the respondent was on bail. 
     
      
    41 It is unfortunate that the Crown did not notify the respondent that it was considering an appeal and it is quite unacceptable that such an important step should have failed because for some reason the relevant fax did not transmit to the prison. But the discretion is exercised not to punish the Crown but as a matter of fairness to the respondent. The consequence of a failure to notify the respondent that the Crown was considering an appeal and a delay of two months in filing the appeal will depend upon all the relevant circumstances including the nature of the sentence against which the appeal is lodged and the degree to which the sentence imposed is inadequate. It is more likely that the discretion to refuse the appeal will be exercised where the respondent has received a non-custodial or short custodial sentence, or where there has been significant prejudice caused to the respondent as a result of the delay. There is nothing in the affidavit of the respondent or in the circumstances of this particular matter that justifies the Court from refusing to interfere in sentences that are so inadequate. There can be less sympathy for the respondent in thinking that the proceedings had been concluded after sentence had been passed when he had delayed them for so long by his own actions. 
     
      
    42 According to the normal practice the sentences I propose are the least that could have been imposed by the Judge and they should not be taken as an indication of what the sentences ought to have been. In particular the failure of the Court to increase the sentence for the s 35 offence should be no indication that the sentence was appropriate. There are no special circumstances except to ensure that the overall minimum term accords with the statutory proportion. The respondent served about two months in custody before being released and it appears that the sentencing Judge overlooked this fact. The sentences have been backdated by two months for this reason. 
     
      
    43 I propose that the respondent be re-sentenced to a total sentence of 4 years and 3 months from 3 December 2005 with an overall non-parole period of 3 years and 1 month to expire on 2 January 2009. 
     
      
    44 In my opinion the following orders should be made: 
     
      
       
        
         
        1. The sentences imposed by Sides DCJ are quashed. 
         
         
        2. In lieu the following sentences are imposed: 
         
         
          
          (a) for the offence of inflict grievous bodily harm imprisonment for 16 months with a non-parole period of 12 months to date from 3 December 2005 with the non-parole period expiring on 2 December 2006. 
          
         
         
          
          (b) for the offences of assault occasioning actual bodily harm a fixed term of imprisonment for 5 months to date from 3 December 2006 and to expire on 2 May 2007 
          
         
         
          
          (c) for the offence of kidnapping imprisonment for 2 years and 9 months to date from 3 May 2007 to expire on 2 February 2010 with a non–parole period of 1 year and 8 months to expire 2 January 2009 the date upon which the respondent is to be released to parole.

      McClellan CJ at CL and Howie J:  
      The Court in this matter was constituted by Mr Justice Sully and ourselves. Mr Justice Sully has since retired from the Court. It has come to our attention that there is a discrepancy between the sentence which was intended to be imposed upon the respondent and the orders pronounced in respect of the offence of kidnapping. It was intended that there be an overall sentence of 4 years 3 months from 3 December 2005. That sentence would expire on 2 March 2010. The overall sentence according to the orders made is one of 4 years and 2 months expiring on 2 February 2010. In view of the difference of only a month in the overall term and it being in the respondent's favour, we do not intend to re-sentence the respondent.

    JUDGMENTSENTENCE - NON PUBLICATION ORDERHIS HONOUR: As to the sentencing of Adam Rawdon Carlton:1 The offender is Adam Rawdon Carlton. He was born on 4 October 1970. Accordingly, he was aged 34 years 10 months when, on 20 August 2005, he committed the subject offences, to which I will refer shortly, and he is aged 36 years four months now.2 The offender is the older of his parents’ two children. He has a sister. His parents separated when he was aged about four years. He has not had any contact with his father since he was aged either about four years or seven years.3 The offender’s mother remarried when he was aged about seven years. He has a half sister from his mother’s marriage to his stepfather. His mother and stepfather separated when he was aged about 13 years.4 The offender has a close relationship with his mother and half sister and a good relationship, albeit not a close one, with his sister.5 Notwithstanding the breakdown of his mother’s marriage to his father and her later marriage to his stepfather, the offender was raised, mainly by his mother, in a happy and supportive environment.6 The offender attended various primary and secondary schools due to his stepfather’s moves about the country as a member of the armed forces. He completed year 10 and obtained the School Certificate. He commenced but did not complete year 11. After leaving school, he attended a TAFE college for a few months but did not complete any course. 7 Notwithstanding that he has undergone appendectomy and tonsillectomy and that he suffered concussion as the result of a motor vehicle collision, there is nothing untoward with the offender’s physical health.8 The offender commenced to smoke cannabis in his mid teens. He progressed - if that be the correct word - to using other prohibited drugs including LSD, ecstasy, amphetamine, cocaine and heroin. His abuse of prohibited drugs caused his downward spiral into a life of crime.9 During some time between August 2001 and May 2002 the offender was treated with medication for a mental illness. In September 2002 he was diagnosed by Dr Robert Tym, psychiatrist, as suffering from schizophrenia, which may have been latent until unmasked by his abuse of prohibited drugs. He has failed to take the medication prescribed for him as and when required and, as it transpired, he was not taking his medication and he was using prohibited drugs at the time when he committed the subject offences.10 The offender has had a number of unskilled employments since leaving school but for most of the time since leaving school he has been unemployed and in receipt of unemployment benefits.11 The offender is single, never having married and he does not have anyone dependent upon him. Since he was aged about 18 years he has had a number of relationships which were short lived and one relationship, his last before his commission of the subject offences, which lasted about 18 months and which caused him depression upon the ending of the relationship.12 As indicated, the offender does not have an unblemished character. He has a criminal record in the Australian Capital Territory - see exhibit T1 - and in New South Wales - see exhibit T2. In the Australian Capital Territory he has been dealt with for 84 offences and in New South Wales he has been dealt with for two offences. I suspect, in the absence of being told to the contrary, that his offences, particularly those involving dishonesty, were related to his abuse of prohibited drugs.13 The offender was on conditional liberty at the time when he committed the subject offences. On 19 September 2003 he was sentenced to imprisonment for 18 months by a magistrate in the Australian Capital Territory Magistrates Court for an offence of burglary, with execution of the sentence being suspended on his entering into a bond to be of good behaviour for three years - that is, to 19 September 2006. His commission of the subject offences on 20 August 2005 amounted to a breach of the bond. This is an aggravating factor of the offences.14 As I have said already, on 20 August 2005 the offender committed the subject offences and on 21 August 2005 the offender was arrested, after which he was interviewed and then charged with, inter alia, the subject offences. He has been in custody, bail refused, since his arrest on 21 August 2005.15 On 24 July 2006 the offender appeared before me in the court at Bathurst to stand his trial. He was represented by Mr Walsh of counsel, instructed by Mr Rolfe, solicitor.16 On the offender being called for trial, Mr Walsh informed me that the offender objected to the Crown Prosecutor adducing evidence of the police search of the premises which had been occupied by the offender and in which the subject offences were alleged to have happened because the application, which had been made for the issue of the search warrant, had not been verified by oath or affirmation as required by s 11 of the Search Warrants Act.17 Accordingly, I conducted a voir dire as to the admissibility of the police search of the premises and as to what had happened during that search, during which voir dire I received documentary material from the Crown Prosecutor - exhibits A to H and J to M - and the offender’s counsel - exhibit 1 - and I heard evidence from Detective Senior Constable McKechnie, the author of exhibit F, and submissions from the Crown Prosecutor and Mr Walsh, after which I allowed the Crown Prosecutor to adduce evidence of the police search of the premises and of what happened during that search.18 My reasons for allowing the Crown Prosecutor to adduce evidence of the police search of the premises were that, as the application for the issue of the search warrant was an application made by telephone, as provided for by s 12 of the Search Warrants Act, the application was not required to be verified on oath or affirmation and that the requirements of s 12, as to the issue of the search warrant, had been met such that the search warrant was issued properly and was valid.19 I mention that during his submissions Mr Walsh commented - I think in passing - that the requirements of s 15A of the Search Warrants Act may not have been dealt with but the evidence satisfied me that those requirements had been met.20 Thus, on 25 July 2006 the offender appeared before me again to stand his trial. The Crown Prosecutor presented an indictment which charged the offender with six counts of aggravated sexual intercourse without consent, knowing the absence of consent - counts 1 to 4, 6 and 7 - one count of attempted aggravated sexual intercourse without consent, knowing the absence of consent - count 5 - and one count of aggravated indecent assault - count 8 - with, as to each count, the aggravating factor being that, at the time of the commission of the offence, the complainant was a child under the age of 16 years. Upon being arraigned the offender pleaded not guilty to each charge. A jury was empanelled. The jury heard evidence from 16 witnesses, all called by the Crown Prosecutor, and it received 18 exhibits, all presented by the Crown Prosecutor, over five days, 25th to 31 July 2006, counsel’s addresses over one day, 31 July 2006, and my summing up over one day, 1 August 2006. In the course of his submissions, the Crown Prosecutor informed the jury of the existence of an alternative charge to counts 1 to 7 of the indictment based upon a different aggravating factor, namely that, at the time of the commission of the offence, the complainant was under the authority of the offender rather than that, at the time of the commission of the offence, the complainant was a child under the age of 16 years.21 On 3 August 2006, after deliberating over three days, the jury returned its verdicts. The jury found the offender to be guilty of counts 1 to 4 and to be not guilty of counts 5 to 8 and of the alternative charges to counts 5 to 7. After taking the jury’s verdicts, I stood over the sentencing proceedings.22 The offences of which the jury found the offender to be guilty were: (1) Count 1 of the indictment, penetration of the complainant’s anus by one of the offender’s fingers; (2) Count 2 of the indictment, penetration of the complainant’s anus by the offender’s penis; (3) Count 3 of the indictment, penetration of the complainant’s anus by a dildo; and (4) Count 4 of the indictment, penetration of the complainant’s genitalia by the offender’s penis.23 These offences are offences contrary to s 61J(1) of the Crimes Act, for which the prescribed penalty is imprisonment for a maximum of 20 years. They are offences that cannot be dealt with summarily. They are offences which, if they fall within the middle range of objective seriousness for offences of their kind, carry a standard non parole period of 10 years.24 The circumstances in which the offender committed the offences are these: The offender had met the complainant once or twice before 20 August 2005. The first meeting was a few weeks before 20 August 2005. At about lunchtime on 20 August 2005 the offender came to the complainant’s father’s home. The complainant asked the defendant whether he would take her to a property outside town so she could visit her friend Bianca. Notwithstanding that he knew that the only car available to him was unusable because the car’s windscreen was broken, the offender asked the complainant’s father whether it would be all right for him to take the complainant to visit Bianca. the complainant’s father said that it would be all right. The offender and the complainant left the complainant’s father’s home and walked to 68 Ferguson Street, at where the offender obtained a pornographic DVD. Then, en route to 48A Gaskill Street, he telephoned Bianca’s mother to ask whether it was all right to bring out the complainant to play with Bianca and he was told that Bianca was not at home but was at a sleepover. However, rather than taking the complainant back to her father’s home, the offender took the complainant to 48A Gaskill Street, at where the offender was staying while the occupier was away. While they were at 48A Gaskill Street, the offender injected himself with something, which he told the complainant was “speed”, into his left arm and he watched the pornographic DVD, forcing the complainant to watch it. Then he pulled down the complainant’s pants and he penetrated the complainant’s anus with one of his fingers, then he penetrated her anus with his penis, then he penetrated her anus with a dildo and finally, after using vegetable oil to lubricate his penis, he penetrated her genitalia with his penis, after which he withdrew and ejaculated onto a pillow slip covering a pillow. The offender returned the complainant to her father’s home at about 7pm, at where he was confronted by the complainant’s father who was concerned for the complainant because, at about 6pm, he had spoken by telephone with Bianca’s mother and was told by her that the complainant had not visited Bianca that day. After arriving home, the complainant told her father and then her next door neighbour and then police what had happened during the time when she was with the offender at 48A Gaskill Street. 25 The offender’s counsel Mr Doyle, who appeared on the sentencing proceedings, submitted that the offences were unplanned, being rather spur of the moment and opportunistic. I do not agree. The conduct of the offender before the commission of the offences showed his intention to do what he did and his planning to achieve his intention. 26 The offender’s counsel submitted that the offences were not accompanied with the use of violence. I accept that the offender did not use any violence upon the complainant, albeit that he held her hand as they walked to 48A Gaskill Street. However, he led her to believe that she could not leave the premises because the front door was locked and he threatened her when telling her not to tell anybody about what had happened.27 The offender’s counsel submitted that the complainant had not suffered any injury as a result of the offences and that, if she had suffered an injury, the injury was not substantial. Although I accept that the complainant did not suffer any physical injury, I do not agree that she did not suffer any injury. I consider that, notwithstanding that I have not been provided with any victim impact statement related to the effect of the offences upon the complainant, the likelihood is that the offences will have an adverse effect upon the sexual and emotional development of the complainant, although the adverse effect is not likely to manifest itself until she is in her late teenage years. Only time will tell whether the emotional harm will be substantial or insubstantial.28 The offender’s counsel submitted that the offender’s mental illness and his failure to take the medication prescribed for his illness contributed towards his commission of the offences in the sense that he was not thinking clearly or rationally, resulting in his acting inappropriately. I accept, notwithstanding the opinion of Professor Greenberg, that the offender has a mental illness and that, at the time when he committed the offences, he was not taking the prescribed medication for his illness and I consider that, as he had not previously committed any offence of a sexual kind, his untreated mental illness played a part in his commission of the offences and that, therefore, his moral responsibility for the offences is reduced.29 In determining appropriate sentences to impose upon the offender for the offences I must recognise the purposes of sentencing stated in s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and I must take into account such of the aggravating factors referred to in s 21A(2) of the Act as are present and such of the mitigating factors referred to in subs (3) of that section as are present and any other relevant factor.30 I consider that, having regard to what I have said about the offences and the offender, the aggravating factors present are those lettered (b) because of the threatened use of violence; (j) because the offender was subject to the bond to be of good behaviour when he committed the offences; (k) because the offender had assumed responsibility for the complainant while she was in his care; (l) because the age of the complainant, then only 10 years six months, made her vulnerable; and (n) because the offences were planned, albeit not without much sophistication, in s 21A(2) of the Act and that none of the mitigating factors lettered in subs (3) of the section is present.31 The offender’s counsel submitted that, as the subject offences are the only offences of a sexual kind committed by the offender, as the offender’s mother will support him on his release from prison and if the offender takes the medication prescribed for his mental illness as and when required, there is a reasonable chance that the offender will be rehabilitated and will not re-offend. Although the evidence as to the offender’s rehabilitation is meagre and although the offender’s past does not instil confidence in me that he will be rehabilitated and will not re-offend, I accept that, if he accepts and complies with treatment for his mental illness, there is a reasonable chance that the offender will be rehabilitated and will not re-offend.32 One factor not mentioned in s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act is deterrence. I accept that, in view of the offender’s mental illness, deterrence, both personal and general, is not as important in this case as it might be in another case.33 What, then, is an appropriate sentence to impose upon the offender for each offence?34 The offender’s counsel submitted that the offences fell toward the bottom of the middle of the range of objective seriousness for offences of their kind and he conceded that the applicable standard non parole period was the starting point, albeit that he submitted that, in view of the offender’s mental illness, the non parole period that should be fixed should be less than the standard non parole period. The Crown Prosecutor submitted that the offences fell in the high end of the range of objective seriousness for offences of their kind. It is difficult to say in any given case where a particular offence falls within the range from high to low of objective seriousness for offences of the kind but I consider, having regard to the circumstance in which the offences were committed and to the factors to which I have referred, that the offences fall within the middle of the range of objective seriousness and that, therefore, the standard non parole period is the starting point for the determination of appropriate sentences.35 I have determined that, balancing everything that I have said about the offences and the offender, that the standard non parole period of 10 years is the appropriate starting point for the sentences, so that the appropriate sentence for each offence is imprisonment for 13 years four months.36 As to whether the sentences should be served concurrently or consecutively or partly concurrently and partly consecutively, the offender’s counsel has submitted that, as the offences were committed by the one offender upon the one complainant over a relatively short period of time, the offences should be served concurrently and the Crown Prosecutor submitted that, to punish properly the offender for having committed four separate and distinct offences upon the one complainant, the offences should be served partly concurrently and partly consecutively. I consider that for the reasons given by the offender’s counsel, and notwithstanding the force of the Crown Prosecutor’s submission, the sentences should be served concurrently.37 As to special circumstances, the offender’s counsel submitted that the offender’s need for appropriate long term treatment for his mental illness and his classification as a “non association” prisoner are special circumstances which justify a reduction in the non parole period with a corresponding increase in the parole period. Although I do not accept that the offender’s need for treatment for his mental illness is a special circumstance, particularly as the parole period would be three years four months if the non parole period were ten years, I accept that his classification as a “non association” prisoner will make prison life more onerous than it should be and I consider this to be a special circumstance to reduce the non parole period to eight years six months and to increase the parole period to four years 10 months. 38 Accordingly, Adam Rawdon Carlton, for each of the four offences of aggravated sexual intercourse upon a child under the age of 16 years, of which the jury has found you to be guilty, you are convicted. For each offence I sentence you to imprisonment for 13 years four months. I fix a non parole period of eight years six months, to commence from 21 August 2005 and to expire on 20 February 2014, on which date you are to be eligible to be released on parole, and a parole period of four years 10 months, to commence on 21 February 2014 and to expire on 20 December 2018. I order that each sentence be served concurrently. I order that you be subject to supervision by the New South Wales Parole Service whilst on parole during the parole period.  *******************

      SENTENCE 
       
      
    1 JOHNSON J: On 1 September 2006, the Offender, KT, appeared before Whealy J and pleaded not guilty to an indictment alleging that, on 4 February 2006, at Auburn in the State of New South Wales, he did murder Kuol Agang. However, the Offender pleaded guilty to manslaughter, charged in the alternative in the indictment, and the Crown accepted that plea in full satisfaction of the indictment. 
     
      
    2 In due course, the sentencing hearing proceeded before me on 1 February 2007, following which I remanded the Offender in custody for sentence today.  
     
      
       
      The Offence 
       
      
    3 The following account is drawn from the Agreed Statement of Facts and other material, admitted into evidence at the sentencing hearing. 
     
      
    4 On the evening of Tuesday 31 January 2006, SG (then 17 years of age) drove his green Ford Laser sedan to Auburn, where he collected the Offender (then 16 years of age - 17 on 5 February 2006). SG also collected another friend. 
     
      
    5 After picking up KT and the other person, SG then drove to McDonalds at Parramatta. KT, SG and the other person then went to the cinema at Auburn. 
     
      
    6 Later in the evening, at about 11.30 pm, KT, SG and the other person commenced driving the streets of Auburn. 
     
      
    7 The driver of the vehicle was SG, with KT in the front passenger's seat and the other person in the rear seat. 
     
      
    8 At this time, KT, SG and the other person had in their possession 12 eggs which they had purchased at a store. Their intention in purchasing and having eggs in their possession was to seek out members of the public and throw eggs at them from the moving vehicle whilst it was being driven by SG, a practice described as “egging”. 
     
      
    9 After most of the eggs had been thrown at various members of the public, they then came upon Kuol Agang (the deceased) in Harrow Road, Auburn. Mr Agang was 28 years old. He was born in Sudan and had come to Australia on 8 September 2005 as a refugee with his wife and four children (then aged nine, seven, four and one) and Mr Agang’s brothers (then aged 15, 14 and 13 years). Mr Agang’s family had fled Sudan and had spent one year and nine months as refugees in Egypt before coming to Australia. 
     
      
    10 At this time, Mr Agang was walking home to Granville after visiting friends in Auburn with his wife. He had been assisting in the preparation of a meal for newly arrived refugees. His wife was still assisting this preparation when Mr Agang left to walk home as he was attending English classes early the following morning. 
     
      
    11 KT, SG and the other person came across Mr Agang walking north along the footpath in Harrow Road, Auburn. When the vehicle was near Mr Agang, KT threw an egg at him. The egg missed Mr Agang. Mr Agang retaliated by throwing either a can or a plastic bottle at the vehicle, striking the vehicle behind the back window. The evidence does not suggest that SG’s vehicle was damaged by this act. A witness, Ngliep Tuan Lai, who was observing the incident from his home nearby in Harrow Road, observed Mr Agang to chase after the vehicle along Harrow Road. 
     
      
    12 SG continued driving down Harrow Road until he came to a roundabout. At the roundabout, SG turned his vehicle around and travelled back along Harrow Road. When the vehicle was opposite to Mr Agang, SG did a u-turn and stopped on the side of the road near the footpath where Mr Agang was. 
     
      
    13 The witness, Mr Lai, observed Mr Agang walking in the direction of the vehicle. Soon after, Mr Agang was standing near a fence outside the Omar Mosque. He was held back from approaching KT, SG and the other person by two persons. It is apparent that Mr Agang had become somewhat agitated as a result of KT throwing the egg at him. 
     
      
    14 KT and SG then got out of the vehicle and ran towards Mr Agang. As KT and SG approached, the witness, Mr Lai, observed that the two persons who had been holding back Mr Agang let him go. 
     
      
    15 After KT and SG had reached Mr Agang, words were spoken and KT said to Mr Agang ""let's fight"". Mr Agang had limited knowledge and ability to speak the English language. 
     
      
    16 KT, who was much larger then Mr Agang, then punched Mr Agang to the jaw. Although both KT and Mr Agang were about 180 cm tall, KT was thick set in build whilst Mr Agang was slim and weighed only 60 kgs. 
     
      
    17 The force of the punch by KT caused Mr Agang to fall to the ground. When he did, he struck his head on the ground. 
     
      
    18 When this occurred there was a noise, like a loud crack. The witness, Mr Lai, observing from his home some distance away, heard “a large noise” which he described as being “like a loud crack”. This was the sound of Mr Agang’s head hitting the ground.  
     
      
    19 KT then warned Mr Agang, saying, “You want more? I’ll be back”. At this time, Mr Agang remained lying on the ground. The witness, Mr Lai, heard KT say these words. 
     
      
    20 KT and SG then ran back to SG's vehicle. SG got back into the driver's seat and KT into the passenger's seat. The vehicle then sped off down Harrow Road. 
     
      
    21 SG then drove KT and the other person home before driving home to North Parramatta. 
     
      
    22 Shortly after the incident, police and ambulance were summoned by eyewitnesses. They arrived shortly after, at about 11.48 pm. At that time, Mr Agang was lying on the footpath unconscious with his pupils fixed and non-responsive. He had a haematoma and mass to the back of the head with a small amount of blood. He was taken to Auburn Hospital and then transferred to Westmead Hospital where he was operated upon for a subdural haematoma on 1 February 2006. On 4 February 2006, a CT scan was performed which showed loss of grey white differentiation suggesting brain infarction. A subsequent nuclear medicine brain scan showed there was no blood flow to the brain, confirming the patient had died. 
     
      
    23 A post mortem examination was conducted upon Mr Agang by Doctor Little on 7 February 2006. She found, on examination, that the major external injuries to Mr Agang were: 
     
      
       
      (a) a fracture of the skull from the base to middle of the head, estimated to be 10 cm in length; 
       
       
      (b) bruising to the left chin and cheek area; 
       
       
      (c) abrasion to the rear of the skull. 
       
      
    24 The summary of the major internal injuries was ""Massive injuries to brain. Brain was deformed and swollen, signs of significant trauma"". 
     
      
    25 Police obtained registration details in relation to SG’s green Ford Laser sedan and a search warrant was obtained for SG’s premises at North Parramatta. SG was spoken to by police and admitted driving the vehicle about the time of the incident. He was arrested and taken to Parramatta Police Station where an ERISP was conducted with him, commencing at 7.30 am on 1 February 2006. He admitted ownership of the vehicle, driving the vehicle and that eggs were thrown from his vehicle, including the egg thrown at Mr Agang. He said that KT jumped out of the vehicle (Q.191) and said “let's fight” (Q.215) and straight away threw a punch at Mr Agang (Q.221). He said that it was a hard punch (Q.469-470) and, when Mr Agang was hit he fell straight to the ground (Q.239). SG heard a “boom” noise when Mr Agang fell down (Q.248,249). 
     
      
    26 At 9.25 pm on 1 February 2006, police executed a search warrant at KT’s home, but KT was not at home at the time. 
     
      
    27 AT 9.30 am on 3 February 2006, KT attended Auburn Police Station with his father and a solicitor and was placed under arrest. An ERISP was conducted with him. KT said that eggs had been obtained for “egging”  to “have some fun” (Q.46, 117). He said that an egg had been thrown at a guy (Q.46) and missed (Q.188-194) and that he had thrown the egg. KT said that the person started running after the vehicle and threw a can of coke at it. He said that he was telling the person ""why did you do that for?” (Q.248). He said that this person was short (Q.287) and was not a large person (Q.288). The man was smaller than KT (Q.283). KT agreed that he was solid and the other person was thin (Q.587-589). KT said that he hit the person pretty hard (Q.323), like a normal punch (Q.324), and he went down (Q.330) and hit his head (Q.332). KT said that he never thought this would happen (Q.345). KT thought the punch would hurt him (Q.396). After Mr Agang was hit, KT believed he had probably been hurt (Q400-401). KT said that he was going to speak to Mr Agang “cause he canned the car” (Q.603). KT was asked (Q.604-605): 
     
      
       
        
        “Q604 But as you’ve stated yourself you’ve, you’ve threw an egg at him to start with? 
         
         
        A That’s no damage. This is damage, money, man. 
         
         
        Q605 So were you angry at Mr Kuol for throwing a can at the car? 
         
         
        A Yeah, I was pretty angry but I didn’t do nothing, went to talk to him.” 
        
       
      
    28 On 7 February 2006, KT was arrested and charged with the murder of Mr Agang. He has remained in custody since that time. 
     
      
       
      Manslaughter by Unlawful and Dangerous Act 
       
      
    29 It is common ground that the plea of guilty of KT to manslaughter was entered on the basis of the commission of an unlawful and dangerous act, being the assault upon Mr Agang which caused him to fall and strike his head heavily to the ground, thereby sustaining fatal injuries. 
     
      
    30 Manslaughter by an unlawful and dangerous act, carrying with it an appreciable risk of serious injury, is a category of involuntary manslaughter. Involuntary manslaughter is so called because, unlike murder, it involves neither intent to cause death or grievous bodily harm to the victim, nor the other mental elements necessary for murder: The Queen v Lavender (2005) 222 CLR 67 at 70 [2]. This form of manslaughter exists because of the importance which the law attaches to human life: The Queen v Lavender at 82-83 [40]. 
     
      
    31 The physical element is the unlawful and dangerous act which causes the death. The mental element required relates to the unlawful and dangerous act; that act must be willed and not accidental: Wilson v The Queen (1991-1992) 174 CLR 313 at 328. The only relevant intent of the accused is an intent to do the act that was unlawful and dangerous and that inadvertently caused death: The Queen v Lavender at 82-83 [40]. For a person to be guilty of manslaughter by an unlawful and dangerous act, the circumstances must be such that a reasonable person in the position of the accused would have realised that he or she was exposing another or others to an appreciable risk of serious injury. It is not sufficient that there was a risk of some harm resulting, albeit not serious harm: Wilson v The Queen at 332-334.  
     
      
    32 It is appropriate to bear these principles in mind in approaching the question of sentence in the present case. The Offender’s plea of guilty constitutes an admission of all the essential elements of the crime of manslaughter: Maxwell v The Queen (1995-1996) 184 CLR 501 at 510. Those elements are as set out above. In due course, I will consider and make findings with respect to the objective seriousness of this particular offence, taking as a starting point the elements of the crime admitted by the Offender’s plea of guilty. 
     
      
       
      Sentencing for Manslaughter 
       
      
    33 The maximum penalty prescribed for the offence of manslaughter is imprisonment for 25 years: s.24 Crimes Act 1900.  
     
      
    34 The offence of manslaughter involves the unlawful taking of a human life, and as such it has long been recognised as one of the most dreadful crimes in the criminal calendar: R v Hill (1981) 3 A Crim R 397 at 402. In R v MacDonald (Court of Criminal Appeal, 12 December 1995, BC9501664), the Court (Gleeson CJ, Kirby P and Hunt CJ at CL) said at page 8: 
     
      
       
        
        “Manslaughter involves the felonious taking of human life. This may involve a wide variety of circumstances, calling for a wide variety of penal consequences. Even so, unlawful homicide, whatever form it takes, has always been recognised by the law as a most serious crime. (See  
        R v Hill 
         (1981) 3 A Crim R 397 at 402.) The protection of human life and personal safety is a primary objective of the system of criminal justice. The value which the community places upon human life is reflected in its expectations of that system.” 
        
       
      
    35 In R v Blacklidge (Court of Criminal Appeal, 12 December 1995, BC9501665), Gleeson CJ (Grove and Ireland JJ agreeing) said at page 4: 
     
      
       
        
        “It has long been recognised that the circumstances which may give rise to a conviction for manslaughter are so various, and the range of degrees of culpability is so wide, that it is not possible to point to any established sentencing tariff which can be applied to such cases. Of all crimes, manslaughter throws up the greatest variety of circumstances affecting culpability.” 
        
       
      
    36 Manslaughter is almost unique in its protean character as an offence: R v Forbes [2005] NSWCCA 377 at [133]-[134]. 
     
      
    37 The importance of denunciation in sentencing for manslaughter has been stressed: R v MacDonald, above, at page 9. Little assistance is to be gained by reference to sentencing statistics which encompass all forms of manslaughter, save so far as they disclose a broad range within which sentences have been passed since their compilation began: R v Mohamad Ali [2005] NSWSC 334 at [61].  
     
      
       
      KT’s Subjective Circumstances 
       
      
    38 There is a substantial body of evidence before the Court concerning KT’s background and subjective circumstances. This evidence is contained in the background report dated 18 January 2007 prepared by officers of the Department of Juvenile Justice for the purpose of s.25 Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987, a report dated 1 November 2006 of Mr Peter Champion, clinical psychologist, tendered in the defence case, and the oral evidence of KT’s mother and Esam Issa, KT’s employer at the time of his entering custody on 7 February 2006. 
     
      
    39 KT did not give evidence in the sentencing proceedings. 
     
      
       
      Family Background 
        
       
      
    40 KT was born on 5 February 1989 in Australia. He is the second eldest of five children in the family. KT’s parents are of Lebanese descent, but married in Australia and all the children were born in Australia. KT’s eldest sibling is married and resides independently with her husband whilst his younger siblings live with their parents in the Auburn area. 
     
      
       
      Criminal History 
       
      
    41 KT has no prior criminal history. 
     
      
       
      Educational and Employment History 
       
      
    42 KT was educated at schools in the Auburn and Granville areas and completed Years 7 to 10 and obtained his School Certificate. It appears that KT was suspended on two occasions in Year 8 for fighting with peers and was struggling to an extent with studies. He started truanting which escalated by Year 10. Nevertheless, he obtained his School Certificate. 
     
      
    43 Following his departure from school, KT enrolled in a sheet metal work/boiler-making course at a TAFE college, where he attended full time for six months. KT stated that he was not successful in finding employment in this area and ceased attending the course in order to commence full-time employment. Since leaving his TAFE studies, KT has worked as an apprentice plumber, and then as a tiler, for short periods before eventually securing full-time employment as a cabinet maker with a firm in Yennora, where he had been working for six months prior to his arrest.  
     
      
    44 According to the background report, KT stated that he enjoyed cabinet making and was planning a return to TAFE studies just prior to his incarceration, so that he could obtain an apprenticeship and receive qualifications to become a certified cabinet maker/carpenter. 
     
      
    45 The oral and documentary evidence confirmed that KT was a punctual, well-mannered and respected worker, whose work was said to be “quite good”. Mr Issa stated that, upon KT’s release from custody, he would provide employment for him once again in the cabinet-making business (T20, 1 February 2007). 
     
      
       
      Drug and Alcohol Use and Associates  
       
      
    46 According to the background report, KT did not present as a young man with a history of problematic drug or alcohol use. He admitted to experimenting with cannabis on one occasion when he was 15 years of age, however stated that he did not enjoy the experience and believed it was a waste of money. Similarly, KT stated that he had tried alcohol on one occasion when he was 16 years of age, but that he did not enjoy the taste and could not finish his drink. There is no suggestion that alcohol or drug use by KT played any part in the commission of the present offence. 
     
      
    47 According to the background report, KT socialises primarily with his younger brother and with close friends whom he met at school. He stated that their activities are typical of most adolescents and generally involves spending time in each other’s homes, listening to music, watching television, going to the beach and occasionally playing football. KT stated that he did not associate with peers who are involved in anti-social activities or who have involvement with the legal system. KT’s mother reported that she did not hold any concerns regarding her son’s peer associates and that she is familiar and accepting of those peers who visit her home. 
     
      
    48 A number of character references tendered in the defence case speak highly of KT and his family. The authors of the references describe KT as a person not given to violence. 
     
      
       
      Conduct in Custody 
       
      
    49 KT was admitted to Cobham Juvenile Justice Centre on 8 February 2006 and was subsequently transferred to Kariong Juvenile Justice Centre on 14 February 2006, where he has remained until the present time. According to the background report, KT initially experienced some difficulty settling into the institutional routine, primarily resulting from the stress of being incarcerated and being separated from his family. After this initial period, KT’s behaviour has reportedly been of a high standard and he has progressed onto the highest unit in the Centre. KT has taken on the position of the Centre sweeper under the supervision of the maintenance overseer. According to the welfare officer, this position is a privileged appointment and involves cleaning the administration office, clinic and other parts of the building. Centre staff reported that KT appears to be a mature, co-operative and hard-working young man with a polite manner.  
     
      
    50 KT has been involved in one violent incident only since being admitted to Kariong, being a fight with another inmate on 28 May 2006. According to the background report, perusal of staff reports and consultation with the welfare officer indicates that the other inmate instigated the assault on KT which resulted in KT’s jaw being fractured. KT was hospitalised and underwent an operation to repair the injury on 2 June 2006.  
     
      
    51 The background report concluded that KT presents as a mature and friendly young man who appears to experience a close relationship with his parents and siblings. He appears to be capitalising on the opportunities presented to him in the custodial setting and continues to receive strong family support.  
     
      
       
      Psychological Report Concerning KT 
        
       
      
    52 A clinical psychologist, Mr Champion, administered to KT the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS-III) test, which is a standard test of ability for those aged 16 years and over. The results obtained by Mr Champion were the subject of a number of specific submissions by Ms Yehia, counsel for the Offender. It is appropriate to refer to a number of Mr Champion’s findings.  
     
      
    53 On the WAIS-III, KT achieved an overall score (or Full Scale IQ) at the top of the borderline disabled range (eighth percentile). The Verbal Scale IQ (low average, 12th percentile) and Performance Scale IQ (borderline disabled, eighth percentile) did not vary to a statistically significant degree. Mr Champion observed (paragraph 12): 
     
      
       
        
        “The picture is one of a reasonably global limitation of intelligence (as reflected in the grosser measures or IQ scores), but not to a level where a formal diagnosis of developmental disability could or would be considered.” 
        
       
      
    54 Mr Champion expressed the following conclusions concerning KT’s intellectual status (paragraphs 16-18): 
     
      
       
        
        “[16] He is perhaps best seen as a very unsophisticated and intellectually limited individual, with poor reasoning skills and a markedly under-developed level of language based skills. 
         
         
        [17] As indicated, while KT demonstrates significant cognitive deficits in many areas, his scores are above the level where a formal diagnosis of developmental disability as per the DSM-IV criteria would be contemplated; and his scores are above the level where IM placement at school would have been a normal consequence.  
         
         
        … 
         
         
        [18] I think that these test results have some significance in terms of the issue of mitigation, given that his language based skills and reasoning abilities are not particularly well formed, and hence foresight and judgment could be expected to be impacted.” 
        
       
      
    55 KT has no history of psychiatric illness or disorder. Mr Champion concluded (paragraph 27): 
     
      
       
        
        “[27] In sum KT does not present with obvious signs of a major form of mental illness, psychological disturbance, neurological impairment or problematic AOD  
        [alcohol or drug]  
        history. The significant feature of his presentation continues to be his intellectual limitations and lack of sophistication. There are no obvious indicators for formal psychotherapy, or the consideration of psychotropic medication.” 
        
       
      
    56 With respect to KT’s involvement in the present offence and the issue of future dangerousness, Mr Champion concluded (paragraph 42): 
     
      
       
        
        “[42] In sum, on the basis of this single assessment, and the history as I know it, ones thinks that the ‘risk’ of future violence (of a criminal type) should probably be rated as low. The general impression is of a pointless form of adolescent bravado or perhaps more correctly machismo (in a group situation, ie. with associates being there or there about), demonstrated by an intellectually limited and naive young man who was 16 at the time of the offence.” 
        
       
      
    57 Mr Champion recommended that consideration be given to KT serving any sentence in juvenile detention, given his age and limitations, rather than in the adult prison system. I will return to submissions concerning this issue, and s.19 (3) Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987, later in these reasons.  
     
      
       
      Victim Impact Statement 
       
      
    58 A victim impact statement of Ms Nyanner Agouk, the widow of Mr Agang, was read to the Court by her solicitor. I acknowledge receipt of the victim impact statement and make a number of comments on it which I consider to be appropriate: s.29(3) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.  
     
      
    59 That statement revealed the profound consequences upon Ms Agouk, her children and her brothers-in-law resulting from the death of Mr Agang. She has lost her husband, her children have lost their father and her brothers-in-law have lost their eldest brother and mentor. As Ms Agouk stated with eloquence and dignity, the family had escaped persecution and the risk of death only to be met, within months, with the sudden and senseless death of Mr Agang. I express the sympathy of the Court and the community to Ms Agouk and her family for this great tragedy. 
     
      
    60 In R v MacDonald, referred to earlier in this judgment, Gleeson CJ, Kirby P and Hunt CJ at CL emphasised the protection of human life and personal safety as a primary objective of the system of criminal justice. Their Honours said (at page 8): 
     
      
       
        
        “Sometimes, as in the present case, the personal qualities of a victim of unlawful homicide will serve to focus attention upon this important aspect of sentencing law. This is not because the punishment for homicide varies according to the personal qualities and characteristics of the victim. Rather, the qualities of a particular victim may serve as a useful reminder of the quality of human life itself, and of all that is involved in taking it away.” 
        
       
       
      This observation is appropriate to the present case. 
       
      
    61 One of the purposes of reading the victim impact statement publicly in the sentencing proceedings is to bring home to the Offender, and others who might act in a similar way, the appalling consequences of the Offender’s actions, extending beyond the death of Mr Agang, which have resulted from a senseless act of violence committed upon a stranger in a public place. The profound and calamitous consequences upon Mr Agang’s family will be entirely clear to the Offender. As the Crown accepts, the law of this State makes clear that a greater sentence cannot be passed because of the impact of the crime on the victim’s family: R v Previtera (1997) 94 A Crim R 76 at 84-87; R v FD and JD (2006) 160 A Crim R 392 at 415-416 [103]-[105], 428 [170]-[171].  
     
      
       
      Objective Seriousness of Offence 
       
      
    62 A central issue in the determination of sentence is an assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence. As the authorities referred to earlier in these reasons make clear, a wide range of criminal conduct is encompassed in the crime of manslaughter. It is necessary to consider the particular circumstances of the present case, by reference to relevant statutory and common law criteria, to form a conclusion concerning this question.  
     
      
    63 I will consider a number of submissions advanced with respect to discrete topics, before turning to the ultimate question relating to objective seriousness. 
     
      
       
      Was the Offence Committed in Company 
      ? 
       
      
    64 The Crown submitted that KT’s offence was committed in company and that this was an aggravating factor within s.21A(2)(e) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. Ms Yehia submitted that the Court should not be satisfied that KT’s offence was committed in company.  
     
      
    65 The evidence reveals that, after KT threw the egg at Mr Agang, who responded by throwing a can or plastic bottle at the vehicle, SG drove up the street, but then turned at a roundabout and drove to the vicinity where Mr Agang was standing. Both KT and SG alighted from the vehicle and ran towards Mr Agang. After they reached Mr Agang, KT said “let’s fight” to Mr Agang and then struck him with one powerful blow to the jaw, felling Mr Agang. SG was at the scene of the assault, having accompanied KT from the vehicle. There is no evidence that SG did or said anything prior to the blow being struck by KT. It would have been apparent to Mr Agang that two persons approached him from the vehicle, although only KT spoke and then struck Mr Agang.  
     
      
    66 The meaning of the term “in company” in provisions of the Crimes Act 1900 has arisen for consideration in a number of cases, some of which were referred to in submissions. In R v Leoni [1999] NSWCCA 14, the Court considered the elements of the offence of robbery in company in s.97(1) Crimes Act 1900. Adams J (Abadee and Barr JJ agreeing) said at [16]: 
     
      
       
        
        “The crucial question arising for decision in this case, is what is meant by the phrase ‘being in company’. In  
        R v Brougham 
         (1986) 43 SASR 187, King CJ said (at 191) - 
         
         
          
          A person commits a robbery, or an assault with ‘intent, in company, where that person participates in the robbery or assault together with another or others in the sense that the victim is confronted by the combined force or strength of two or more persons or that the forces of two or more persons are deployed against the victim. It is not necessary that more than one participant actually strike or rob the victim; it is sufficient that the accused and one or more other participants be physically present for the common purpose of robbing, or assaulting with intent, and of physically participating if required’.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    67 In R v Villar and Zugecic [2004] NSWCCA 302, the Court considered the meaning of the term “in company” for the purpose of the offence of aggravated sexual assault under s.61J Crimes Act 1900. Grove J (Simpson and Howie JJ agreeing) at [68], applying R v Leoni, observed that “where a victim is confronted by the combined force or strength of two or more persons, that will be sufficient (to fulfil a circumstance of aggravation) ‘even if the offender did not, as it happens, intend to physically participate if required’”. 
     
      
    68 In R v Button and Griffen (2002) 54 NSWLR 455, the Court of Criminal Appeal considered the term “in company” for the purpose of the offence of aggravated sexual assault in s.61J Crimes Act 1900. Kirby J (Heydon JA agreeing) considered a number of authorities in R v Brougham (1986) 43 SASR 187 and R v Leoni and said at [120]: 
     
      
       
        
        “What emerges from these cases? A number of propositions can be stated: 
         
         
        · First, the statutory definition (s61J(2)(c)) requires that the offender be ‘in the company of another person or person’. 
         
         
        · Secondly, the accused and such person, or persons, must share a common purpose (either to rob, or as here, sexually assault). 
         
         
        · Thirdly, the cases appear to assume that each participant is physically present. 
         
         
        · Fourthly, participation in the common purpose without being physically present (for example, as a look-out or as an accessory before the fact) is not enough. 
         
         
        · Fifthly, the perspective of the victim (being confronted by the combined force or strength or two or more persons) is relevant, although not determinative. If two or more persons are present, and share the same purpose, they will be ‘in company’, even if the victim was unaware of the other person.” 
        
       
      
    69 In the present case, Ms Yehia emphasises the fact that the Crown has indicated a preparedness to accept a plea of guilty from SG to a charge of being an accessory after the fact to assault occasioning actual bodily harm of Mr Agang (T5.43, 1 February 2007). This has come to pass with SG before me today following his plea of guilty to an indictment containing that sole count. She submits that such an approach by the Crown reflects an acceptance that SG’s criminality arises from his conduct after KT struck Mr Agang, and not before. In these circumstances, in particular, Ms Yehia submits that the Court cannot be satisfied that KT’s offence “was committed in company” for the purpose of s.21A(2)(e).  
     
      
    70 More than physical presence of another person is required for an offence to be committed “in company”. Although SG accompanied KT from the vehicle and was present when KT struck Mr Agang, I am not satisfied that these facts give rise to a finding that KT’s offence was “committed in company” within the meaning of s.21A(2)(e). I am not satisfied that the aggravating factor in s.21A(2)(e) is demonstrated in this case.  
     
      
       
      Was KT’s Offence Part of a Planned or Organised Criminal Activity 
      ? 
       
      
    71 The Crown submits that KT’s offence was part of “a planned … criminal activity” so as to be a factor in aggravation by reference to s.21A(2)(n) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. Ms Yehia submits that the Court ought not be satisfied that this aggravating factor exists in this case. 
     
      
    72 The Crown submits that KT, SG and the other person embarked upon planned criminal activity, involving travelling around the suburb of Auburn in a vehicle for the purpose of throwing eggs at citizens in the street. It was submitted that the propulsion of eggs at individuals in the street constituted an assault on each person treated in that way. The Crown submits that it was clear to KT and his companions that persons at whom eggs were thrown in a public street for no apparent reason would, whether the egg struck or not, become upset, fearful or agitated as a result. It was submitted that the reaction of Mr Agang was entirely predictable and that KT demonstrated, by his actions, a willingness to engage in a violent confrontation as part of the planned criminal activity of assaulting persons by propelling eggs at them.  
     
      
    73 The wording of s.21A(2)(n) conveys more than simply that the offence was planned: Fahs v R [2007] NSWCCA 26 at [21]. 
     
      
    74 I accept that the throwing of an egg at a person is capable of constituting an assault, whether or not the egg strikes the person. I accept that KT planned to engage in that activity. However, the offence here involved the striking of a blow to Mr Agang at a time when both persons were standing in the street, some time after the egg was thrown.  
     
      
    75 Although the throwing of the egg was the first act in a series of events which led to the death of the victim, I am not satisfied that the offence of manslaughter was part of planned criminal activity, in the sense envisaged in s.21A(2)(n) of the Act. I am not satisfied that this particular statutory aggravating factor is made out in this case. 
     
      
    76 However, the course of conduct engaged in by KT over a period of time before the confrontation with Mr Agang is relevant to a determination of the objective seriousness of the offence. I will return to this factor later in these reasons.  
     
      
    77 Ms Yehia submits that the Court should find, as a mitigating factor for the purpose of s.21A(3)(b), that the offence was not part of a planned or organised criminal activity. It was submitted that the Offender’s conduct in throwing the egg at the deceased ought be considered as remote from the Offender’s subsequent conduct in striking Mr Agang to the face, and that the striking of the blow was “impulsive in nature”. I am not satisfied that this is an appropriate characterisation of the Offender’s conduct. The fact that an aggravating factor in s.21A(2)(n) is not established does not lead to the obverse finding that the mitigating factor under s.21A(3)(b) is necessarily proved. I do not accept Ms Yehia’s submission that the mitigating factor in s.21A(3)(b) is demonstrated in this case.  
     
      
       
      Was the Offender Not Fully Aware of the Consequences of his Actions Because of his Age or any Disability 
      ? 
       
      
    78 Ms Yehia submits that a finding ought be made, as a mitigating factor, that the Offender was “not fully aware of the consequences of his actions … because of [his] age or any disability”: s.21A(3)(j) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. The foundation for the submission concerning disability is Mr Champion’s report referred to earlier in these reasons. The Crown submits that the evidence does not support a finding that this mitigating factor is available in this case. 
     
      
    79 It is appropriate to take into account the age of the Offender in imposing sentence. I will return to that issue later in this judgment.  
     
      
    80 The issue raised by s.21A(3)(j), however, is whether the Court is satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that the Offender was not fully aware of the consequences of his actions because of his age or any disability.  
     
      
    81 It does not seem to me that Mr Champion’s report supports a finding that the Offender was not fully aware of the consequences of his actions because of any disability. Mr Champion’s report does not demonstrate the existence of any mental illness, psychological disturbance, mental abnormality or developmental disability. Mr Champion described the Offender as “a very unsophisticated and intellectually limited individual”. The Offender had engaged in a course of conduct, involving a type of nuisance activity over a period of time. The egg throwing was certainly immature. It was intended, at the least, to upset strangers walking in the street late at night. The conduct was undertaken for the amusement of KT and his companions.  
     
      
    82 The Offender was prepared to elevate the conduct to direct physical confrontation with a willingness, which he acted upon, to use substantial violence upon a stranger in the street.  
     
      
    83 The Offender was employed and appears to have functioned at a reasonable level in both his work and social life.  
     
      
    84 I am not satisfied that the mitigating factor contained in s.21A(3)(j) has been established in this case. 
     
      
       
      Assessing the Objective Seriousness of the Offence 
       
      
    85 The Crown submits that the facts disclose a very serious course of criminality in this case. It was submitted that the Offender intentionally obtained objects, namely eggs, to assault fellow citizens late at night in the street. After seeking out the victim and throwing an egg at him from a moving vehicle, the Offender returned to the victim to physically assault him. The Offender ran from the vehicle towards the victim. The Crown emphasised that KT was physically much larger than the victim. KT punched Mr Agang, causing him to fall to the footpath. From the blow and its effect, the victim was rendered unconscious. Thereafter, whilst the victim lay on the ground, KT threatened him with a further assault. KT then ran back to the vehicle and drove from the area without ever considering the welfare of the victim or rendering any assistance to him at all. 
     
      
    86 The Crown submitted that a civilised society cannot tolerate the behaviour exhibited by the Offender, where a citizen cannot walk the streets at night without being assaulted by projectiles thrown from a moving vehicle, and then being further assaulted and left on the footpath.  
     
      
    87 Ms Yehia submits that the egg-throwing conduct of KT and his companions ought be understood, using Mr Champion’s words, as a pointless form of adolescent bravado or machismo which escalated, impulsively and quickly, into an incident where a single forceful blow was struck by KT to Mr Agang which, tragically, caused him to strike his head forcefully on the ground, thereby sustaining fatal injuries. Without seeking to in any way blame Mr Agang for what occurred, Ms Yehia submits that Mr Agang’s act of throwing the can or bottle, and thereafter being agitated, had escalated the incident in a manner which was relevant to an assessment of KT’s criminal culpability. Taking into account the single punch, the impulsive nature of the act and the absence of a follow-up assault, it was submitted that the offence lay at the lower end of the range of objective seriousness for the offence of manslaughter.  
     
      
    88 I have given careful consideration to the submissions advanced on this question. In assessing the objective seriousness of the crime, it is necessary to place the fatal blow in its broader factual context.  
     
      
    89 KT was travelling in a vehicle late at night in a suburb of Sydney, having determined to act in a way designed, at least, to frighten and upset strangers in the street. The activity was being undertaken for the enjoyment of KT and his companions, at the expense of the strangers subjected to “egging”.  
     
      
    90 The Crown submitted this was a form of gang activity. I do not accept this submission. However, it is appropriate to characterise it as hoodlum behaviour. It was entirely predictable that a person subjected to this activity would react in an angry fashion. The sudden reaction of Mr Agang to throw his can or bottle of drink at SG’s vehicle, and to remain agitated, was both predictable and, viewed in context, understandable. That act, however, did not injure any person in the vehicle or threaten to injure any person. Nor, as it happened, did it damage the vehicle.  
     
      
    91 KT and his companions did not simply drive away, leaving an upset Mr Agang in the street. The vehicle travelled to a roundabout and returned in the direction of Mr Agang and was parked near him. Mr Agang remained upset. He was restrained by other persons in the street and posed no threat to KT. Nevertheless, KT left the vehicle and moved quickly to the spot where Mr Agang stood.  
     
      
    92 KT, although 16 almost 17 years of age, was physically much larger than the slender and light Mr Agang. A photograph of KT, taken on 3 February 2006, depicts a tall young man of solid build, with a goatee beard and a mohawk haircut.  
     
      
    93 KT immediately invited confrontation with the words “let’s fight” directed to Mr Agang. At that time, Mr Agang did not represent an actual threat to KT. 
     
      
    94 KT struck a very forceful blow to Mr Agang’s head, causing him to fall to the ground. KT did not pull his punch. The punch was intended to hurt Mr Agang, although KT did not intend to kill him or cause him grievous bodily harm. KT’s punch was intended to punish Mr Agang for his audacity in reacting to the “egging” in the way in which he did. 
     
      
    95 A loud crack resulted from Mr Agang’s head hitting the ground. The sound was obvious to all around, including a witness to the event some distance away. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the sound was heard by the Offender. He realised that Mr Agang had been injured. Rather than offering assistance to Mr Agang, KT said loudly “You want more? I’ll be back.” KT and SG then departed quickly by vehicle, leaving Mr Agang lying on the footpath. 
     
      
    96 I accept that KT was not aware of the full extent of injuries suffered by Mr Agang at the time when he departed. In the records of interview of KT and SG, it is stated that the victim’s eyes were open and that he appeared to be conscious. However, KT had heard the loud crack as the victim’s head hit the footpath. Mr Agang was not immediately returning to his feet. At the time when KT determined to quickly leave the scene, he was in no position to conclude that Mr Agang was in a fit state. Rather than offer any assistance, KT made a further threat of violence directed to the victim and then departed. 
     
      
    97 The violence of the Offender was perpetrated in a public street where persons were present, and where it would be a particular affront to civil peace to have a man killed in this way: R v Inzitari (Court of Criminal Appeal, 28 March 1985, unreported). This was a brutal and cowardly act directed to a stranger in the street: R v MD (2005) 156 A Crim R 372 at 379 [24]. 
     
      
    98 KT was not affected by alcohol or drugs at the time of the offence. He did not suffer from any mental illness or disorder or mental disability. I do not consider that Mr Champion’s assessment that the Offender was an unsophisticated and intellectually limited individual bears in any significant way upon an assessment of the objective seriousness of this offence. 
     
      
    99 I have regard to the fact that a single punch was thrown and that no weapon was used. I have regard to the fact that it was the striking of Mr Agang’s head on the ground which produced the fatal injuries. Nevertheless, having regard to the wider context surrounding the offence, I am satisfied that the present offence is an objectively serious one. The objective seriousness exceeds the level submitted by counsel for the Offender. 
     
      
      The Offender’s Plea of Guilty 
       
      
    100 It was submitted for the Offender that a discount of 25% ought be allowed by reference to the Offender’s plea of guilty: s.21A(3)(k), s.22 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999; R v Thomson and Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383. The Crown accepted that this was an early plea, but did not concede that it was entered at the earliest opportunity.  
     
      
    101 The Offender was charged with murder on 7 February 2006. Evidence was given by Ms Joanne Harris of the Legal Aid Commission that she had come into the matter on 18 April 2006. The final parts of the Crown brief, including the post mortem report and record of interview with SG, were served on 7 June 2006. On 8 June 2006, Ms Harris appeared for KT before the Lidcombe Children’s Court. The matter was adjourned to 19 July 2006 to permit submissions to be made to the Director of Public Prosecutions indicating a willingness on KT’s part to plead guilty to manslaughter. For reasons explained by Ms Harris in her evidence relating to illness of counsel, the submission was not made to the Director of Public Prosecutions prior to 19 July 2006, on which date KT was committed for trial on the charge of murder. By letter dated 15 August 2006, Ms Harris submitted to the Director of Public Prosecutions that KT was prepared to plead guilty to manslaughter and requested that the Crown accept that plea in full satisfaction of the indictment. As I have mentioned, when KT was arraigned before Whealy J on 1 September 2006, the Crown took that course. 
     
      
    102 I am not at all sure that evidence which explains the reasons for a delay in plea is relevant to an assessment of discount to be given by reference to the principles in R v Thomson and Houlton: R v Stambolis (2006) 160 A Crim R 510 at 513-515 [8]-[14]. 
     
      
    103 Nevertheless, I accept that active steps were contemplated on KT’s behalf before committal for trial to offer a plea of guilty to manslaughter. A submission to that effect was not made before committal in circumstances beyond the control of KT. Soon after committal, KT offered such a plea which was accepted by the Crown on his first appearance in this Court. In these circumstances, I am prepared to allow a discount of 25% for the Offender’s plea of guilty by reference to the principles in R v Thomson and Houlton. 
     
      
       
      Remorse 
       
      
    104 Counsel for the Offender submits that KT has demonstrated remorse which ought be taken into account under s.21A(3)(i) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. It was submitted that the Offender had expressed regret for his actions to the officers who prepared the background report and to Mr Champion. Further, the Offender wrote a letter dated 6 September 2006 to the victim’s widow apologising for his actions. The letter (Exhibit 2) was provided to the Crown’s instructing solicitor, but the view was taken by the Crown that it should not be forwarded on to Ms Agouk. Nevertheless, Ms Yehia submits that the writing of the letter demonstrated remorse on the Offender’s part. In addition, it was submitted that the Offender’s early plea of guilty indicated genuine remorse and contrition on is part.  
     
      
    105 The Crown submits that there are certain impediments to a finding in the Offender’s favour with respect to remorse. Reference was made to KT’s departure from the scene immediately after striking Mr Agang, without any concern for his then state of health, and with threatening words being directed to him by KT. The Crown submits that, although KT was aware from the evening of 1 February 2006 that police wished to speak to him concerning the incident, he did not present himself until the morning of 3 February 2006 for interview. The Crown submits that the contents of the record of interview with KT did not provide support for a finding of contrition and remorse, although it was apparent to KT, at that time, that Mr Agang was seriously injured. 
     
      
    106 There are features in this case which operate for and against the Offender with respect to remorse. His departure from the scene, accompanied by a verbal threat to Mr Agang, is inconsistent with any remorse or contrition on his part at that time for the consequences of his blow to Mr Agang. There was no offer of assistance. Indeed, the contrary occurred with KT directing intimidating words to the victim. 
     
      
    107 I do not consider that any delay between the evening of 1 February and the morning of 3 February 2006 in KT’s attendance upon the police operates adversely to him on this issue. It is the fact that he did present himself, together with his father and a solicitor, on the morning of 3 February 2006 and agreed to provide a lengthy interview with the police. 
     
      
    108 In my view, the contents of the record of interview do not provide particular assistance to the Offender on the issue of remorse. A number of admissions are made, but there are other areas where answers are given which do not support the then existence of remorse. 
     
      
    109 I accept that the Offender’s expressions of remorse, directed to officers of the Department of Juvenile Justice and to Mr Champion, are genuine. The observations and assessment of his conduct in custody in the past year provide some support for the genuineness of this remorse. Undoubtedly, he has had an opportunity to consider the consequences of his actions. 
     
      
    110 In my view, there was a very strong Crown case against the Offender with respect to the crime of manslaughter. This factor is relevant to the assessment of remorse by way of entry of the plea of guilty to that charge. 
     
      
    111 In summary, I am satisfied that the conduct of the Offender immediately after striking the victim, and in subsequent days, did not demonstrate remorse on his part. However, in the period during which he has been in custody, he has developed genuine remorse for his crime. I will take this into account in his favour in determining sentence. It is relevant to an assessment of his prospects of rehabilitation and the likelihood of him committing further offences in the future: R v MAK and MSK [2006] NSWCCA 381 at [41]. 
     
      
       
      The Offender’s Youth 
       
      
    112 The Offender has pleaded guilty to a serious children’s indictable offence and must be dealt with according to law: s.17 Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987. 
     
      
    113 Section 6 Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 provides as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        Principles relating to the exercise of criminal jurisdiction 
         
         
        A court, in exercising criminal jurisdiction with respect to children, shall have regard to the following principles: 
         
         
        (a) that children have rights and freedoms before the law equal to those enjoyed by adults and, in particular, a right to be heard, and a right to participate, in the processes that lead to decisions that affect them, 
         
         
        (b) that children who commit offences bear responsibility for their actions but, because of their state of dependency and immaturity, require guidance and assistance, 
         
         
        (c) that it is desirable, wherever possible, to allow the education or employment of a child to proceed without interruption, 
         
         
        (d) that it is desirable, wherever possible, to allow a child to reside in his or her own home, 
         
         
        (e) that the penalty imposed on a child for an offence should be no greater than that imposed on an adult who commits an offence of the same kind.” 
        
       
      
    114 Ms Yehia placed particular reliance upon s.6(b), (c) and (d) in her submissions on sentence. Reliance was placed on the principle that, when sentencing young offenders, considerations of punishment and general deterrence should generally be regarded as subordinate to the need to foster rehabilitation: R v GDP (1991) 53 A Crim R 112. Ms Yehia acknowledged that this principle has been qualified in later cases, particularly where the offending behaviour has demonstrated that the young offender has conducted himself in a way that an adult does: R v Tran [1999] NSWCCA 109 at [9].  
     
      
    115 It was submitted, however, that the present case called for application of the general principle with respect to sentencing a young offender. It was submitted that the Offender was not conducting himself as an adult. It was submitted that he was behaving in a childish and immature manner in throwing eggs at persons, and had reacted impulsively to the victim hitting the car with an object. He struck one blow to the deceased and then walked away. 
     
      
    116 The Crown acknowledges that the age of an offender can mitigate an appropriate sentence. However, the Crown submits that these considerations have very much less weight when an offender has behaved with extreme violence or has acted as an adult: R v Tran at [9]; R v Hoang [2003] NSWCCA 380 at [44]. Further, the Crown submits that the weight to be given to these considerations diminishes the closer the offender approaches the age of maturity: R v Hoang at [45]. Reliance was placed upon the remarks of Lee CJ at CL in R v Pham and Ly (1991) 55 A Crim R 128 at 135 concerning offences of violence committed by young persons. Reliance was placed upon R v DSW [2003] NSWCCA 322, where Barr J (Studdert and Whealy JJ agreeing) said at [24]: 
     
      
       
        
        “The Crown acknowledged that general deterrence is generally not as important in fashioning sentences to be imposed upon young offenders and that consideration of rehabilitation is correspondingly more important. Reference was been made to  
        R v GDP 
         (1991) 53 A Crim R 112. The Crown also correctly submitted, by reference to cases like  
        R v Pham 
         (1991) 55 A Crim R 128,  
        R v Hawkins 
         (1993) 67 A Crim R 64 and  
        R v Gordon 
         (1994) 71 A Crim R 459, that the need to protect the community requires that deterrence and retribution remain significant elements even in sentencing youthful offenders.” 
        
       
      
    117 I have given careful consideration to these submissions. The Offender was 16, almost 17, years of age at the time of the offence. His initial conduct, involving the throwing of eggs at persons in the street, has an element of immaturity about it. However, his conduct in returning to the place where Mr Agang stood for the purpose of engaging in a violent confrontation, which led to the infliction of a very powerful blow by him which felled Mr Agang, was not juvenile behaviour. The Offender was powerfully built with the appearance of a young man, and not a child. He had left school and was in employment and was living a life closer to that of an adult than a child. He was out with friends late in the evening. 
     
      
    118 In my view, the factors of punishment and deterrence are significant factors on sentence in this case. General deterrence is an important factor in this case. Young persons must be made aware that the vulnerability of human beings requires restraint by others and a rejection of unprovoked violent assaults: R v MD at 389 [73]. Specific deterrence is less important, as the Offender has developed some insight into his offence and now has become contrite. However, this was an objectively serious offence committed by a young man living in an adult world. Although the provisions of s.6 Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 and sentencing principles with respect to young offenders remain relevant, it is appropriate in this case to reflect on sentence the elements of punishment and deterrence which must not be subsidiary to the rehabilitation of the Offender. 
     
      
       
      The Appropriate Sentence 
       
      
    119 I have had regard to the objective seriousness of the offence to which reference has been made earlier in this judgment. I have had regard to the Offender’s plea of guilty, remorse (to the extent outlined earlier), prior good character, age, good prospects of rehabilitation and the matters contained in the background report and the report of Mr Champion. 
     
      
    120 At the heart of the offence of manslaughter is the taking of a human life. The infliction of violence upon a stranger in a public street is always serious. Where the act of violence causes the death of a person, the Courts must denounce such conduct by imposition of appropriate sentences. A significant sentence of imprisonment is required in this case to punish and deter the Offender and to deter others who may engage in similar conduct. 
     
      
    121 Having regard to all the factors to which I have adverted, I am satisfied that the appropriate head sentence in this case is imprisonment for six years. 
     
      
    122 Counsel for the Offender has submitted that a finding of “special circumstances” should be made. Reliance is placed upon the Offender’s youth and good prospects of rehabilitation, his prior good character and the availability of employment upon release together with the fact that this is the first time that the Offender has been incarcerated. I am satisfied that special circumstances have been demonstrated in this case. I propose to fix a non-parole period of four years. 
     
      
    123 It is appropriate that the sentence commence on the date when the Offender entered custody, 7 February 2006. 
     
      
    124 KT attained the age of 18 years on 5 February 2007. Accordingly, unless an order is made under s.19(3) Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987, KT is not eligible to serve a sentence of imprisonment as a juvenile offender. Section 19 is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        Court may direct imprisonment to be served as a juvenile offender 
         
         
        (1) If a court sentences a person under 21 years of age to whom this Division applies to imprisonment in respect of an indictable offence, the court may, subject to this section, make an order directing that the whole or any part of the term of the sentence of imprisonment be served as a juvenile offender. 
         
         
          
          Note. The effect of such an order is that the person to whom the order relates will be committed to a detention centre (see subsection (6)). There he or she will be detained as specified in the order. In certain circumstances, he or she may subsequently be transferred to a correctional centre pursuant to an order under section 28 of the Children (Detention Centres) Act 1987. 
          
         
         
        (2) A person is not eligible to serve a sentence of imprisonment as a juvenile offender after the person has attained the age of 21 years, unless: 
         
         
          
          (a) in the case of a sentence for which a non-parole period has been set—the non-parole period will end within 6 months after the person has attained that age, or 
           
           
          (b) in the case of a sentence for which a non-parole period has not been set—the term of the sentence of imprisonment will end within 6 months after the person has attained that age. 
          
         
         
        (3) A person who is sentenced to imprisonment in respect of a serious children’s indictable offence is not eligible to serve a sentence of imprisonment as a juvenile offender after the person has attained the age of 18 years, unless: 
         
         
          
          (a) the sentencing court is satisfied that there are special circumstances justifying detention of the person as a juvenile offender after that age, or 
           
           
          (b) in the case of a sentence for which a non-parole period has been set—the non-parole period will end within 6 months after the person has attained that age, or 
           
           
          (c) in the case of a sentence for which a non-parole period has not been set—the term of the sentence of imprisonment will end within 6 months after the person has attained that age. 
          
         
         
          
          This subsection is subject to subsection (2). 
          
         
         
        (4) In determining whether there are special circumstances for the purposes of subsection (3), the court may have regard to the following matters: 
         
         
          
          (a) the degree of vulnerability of the person, 
           
           
          (b) the availability of appropriate services or programs at the place the person will serve the sentence of imprisonment, 
           
           
          (c) any other matter that the court thinks fit. 
          
         
         
        (5) A person who is subject to an order under this section that ceases or ceased to apply on the person attaining the age of 18 years may apply to the sentencing court for a further order under this section. Any such application requires the leave of the court. 
         
         
        (6) The warrant of commitment that is issued under section 62 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 in relation to a sentence of imprisonment the subject of an order under this section: 
         
         
          
          (a) must indicate that the sentence is the subject of such an order, and 
           
           
          (b) must specify how much of the sentence is to be served as a juvenile offender, and 
           
           
          (c) must, despite the provisions of that section, commit the person to whom it relates to a detention centre. 
          
         
         
        (7) Nothing in this section, or in any order under this section, limits the operation of section 28 of the Children (Detention Centres) Act 1987.” 
        
       
      
    125 Counsel for the Offender submits that the Court should be satisfied that there are special circumstances, justifying detention of KT as a juvenile offender after the age of 18 years, for the purposes of s.19(3)(a) of the Act. It is submitted that KT is vulnerable (s.19(4)(a)) and reliance is placed upon the recommendation of Mr Champion with respect to detention as a juvenile offender. 
     
      
    126 Counsel for the Offender submits that the following factors support a finding of special circumstances for the purpose of s.19(3)(a) of the Act: 
     
      
       
      (a) this is the first contact which the Offender has had with the criminal justice system and the first time he has been incarcerated - he has already suffered a serious assault whilst in custody and is a vulnerable person; 
       
       
      (b) all indications are that the Offender is progressing well whilst he has been in custody and is now working as a sweeper, a position of trust; 
       
       
      (c) although now 18 years old, his limited cognitive abilities would place him in a vulnerable position in the prison system; 
       
       
      (d) the Offender’s rehabilitation will be substantially enhanced by his continued detention as a juvenile offender:  
      R v VDN  
      [2004] NSWSC 426 at [57]. 
       
      
    127 The Crown submits that the Offender is a well-developed young male who would not be any more vulnerable than any other prisoner in gaol. The Crown submits further that the Offender would have available to him the appropriate services and programs to further his education and trade skills in an adult prison. 
     
      
    128 I have given careful consideration to the submissions advanced on this issue. The background report prepared by officers of the Department of Juvenile Justice, and the report of Mr Champion, provide substantial support for the finding of special circumstances advanced by counsel for the Offender. I accept that the Offender would be vulnerable in the adult prison system. Despite his physical size, he is not a threat to any person at the detention centre, staff or inmates. As Whealy J found in R v VDN, I am satisfied that the Offender’s rehabilitation will be substantially enhanced by his continued detention in a juvenile detention centre. It is in the particular need of the Offender to maintain relationships with staff and others involved in his rehabilitation in the juvenile detention centre, that special circumstances may be found in this case: R v MB [2006] NSWSC 1164 at [36]. The assessment of Mr Champion concerning his intellectual ability is pertinent to this as well: DAC v R [2006] NSWCCA 265 at [23]. Accordingly, for the purposes of s.19(3) Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987, I find that there are special circumstances justifying the detention of the Offender in a detention centre. 
     
      
    129 KT, for the crime of manslaughter to which you have pleaded guilty, I sentence you to a non-parole period of four years to date from 7 February 2006 and to expire on 6 February 2010, with a balance of term of two years to commence on 7 February 2010 and to expire on 6 February 2012. I find that there are special circumstances under s.19(3) Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987. I direct that the Offender serve his sentence prior to release to parole as a juvenile offender. The Offender will be eligible to be released to parole on 6 February 2010.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 SIMPSON J: Pursuant to s5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 the Crown appeals against a sentence imposed upon the respondent in the District Court on 6 November 2006, following his plea of guilty to a single count of driving in a manner dangerous and causing grievous bodily harm. The charge was brought under s52A(3)(c) of the Crimes Act 1900, and carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for seven years. The sentence imposed was of a non-parole period of nine months and an additional term of nine months, dating from 6 November 2006, to be served by way of periodic detention. Pursuant to s166 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986, three additional offences (one count of driving under the influence of alcohol, one count of driving whilst unlicensed, and one count of driving an unregistered vehicle) were transferred to, and dealt with in, the District Court. In respect of each of these offences a fine of $200 was imposed. 
     
      
    2 The offence occurred in the early hours of 9 January 2005, a Sunday. On the previous evening the respondent and two friends (Andrew McGlone and Aiden Mason) attended a party in Wilberforce. They had previously purchased two cartons of small bottles of beer. Aiden Mason drove Mr McGlone and the respondent to the party. At the party, the three men between them drank one carton of beer. The respondent and Mr McGlone then drank some more from the second carton. 
     
      
    3 Between 1.30 a.m. and 2.00 a.m. another (female) friend drove the respondent and Mr McGlone to the respondent’s home in Windsor. The respondent was then considering returning to the party, riding his motorcycle. The female friend urged him not to do so. 
     
      
    4 The respondent then obtained the keys to his mother’s car, a Holden Kingswood. This vehicle was not registered. The respondent did not hold a driver’s licence. With Mr McGlone as passenger, he drove the Kingswood towards Ebenezer, on the Sackville Road. There, on a straight stretch of road, he lost control of the vehicle, which collided with a tree. 
     
      
    5 Mr McGlone sustained significant facial fractures, including a right orbital complex fracture. He underwent reconstructive surgery. There were also indications that he may have suffered some mild traumatic brain injury, but this assessment was guarded, being complicated by his alcohol consumption on the night of these events, and an apparently heavy alcohol consumption in previous times, as well as a history as a boxer: this left open the possibility of a cumulative effect causing the apparent brain injury. In any event, when assessed, in July and October 2006, he displayed severe levels of stress, and low levels of complex verbal memory, complex visual memory, and executive function. Not all of these symptoms could confidently be attributed to the consequences of the collision. 
     
      
    6 Shortly after the collision Mr McGlone was observed, wandering on the roadway with blood on his face, by a passing motorist who called police. This witness also saw another man, no doubt the respondent. The respondent was no longer present when police arrived. The next morning (Monday) he was not at home. He gave evidence in the sentencing proceedings to the effect that he had assisted Mr McGlone by carrying him, intending to take him to the nearest house, but gave up this attempt when he heard sirens, which signified the arrival of police. 
     
      
    7 Later on the same day the respondent told another friend that his father had reported the Kingswood stolen and that he was going to deny everything. He said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I was just thrashing it and I lost it.” 
        
       
      
    8 The respondent was arrested on 19 May 2005. He denied having been the driver of the car at the time of the collision. He said that, having been driven home earlier in the morning, he had remained at home. He concocted a false account of his movements after having been driven home on the evening of the crash. On 16 March 2006 the respondent entered a plea of not guilty to a charge of dangerous driving under the influence of intoxicating liquor. On 4 September 2006 he entered a plea of guilty to the present charge. 
     
      
       
      Subjective circumstances  
       
      
    9 Before the sentencing judge was a pre-sentence report, dated 6 November 2006. From this, together with other material, the following emerged. The respondent was born on 14 December 1982. He was therefore just 22 years of age at the time of the offence. He had no prior convictions. He was, however, at the time, facing a charge of assault occasioning actual bodily harm (of which the victim was his father) and was on bail in respect of that charge. 
     
      
    10 According to the pre-sentence report the respondent had a conventional childhood in a close family of three children, of whom he is the eldest. During adolescence his behaviour deteriorated and he became associated with a peer group who exerted a negative influence upon him. This was current at the time of the offence. He abused alcohol. Relations with his parents were poor. His behaviour changed after the offence and by the time the pre-sentence report was written, harmonious relations had been restored. 
     
      
    11 He has had unskilled employment, at the time of the report working as a labourer in a printing works. He was well regarded, as reliable and hardworking, in his employment. 
     
      
    12 He is in a de facto partnership, with a four-month old (at the time of sentencing) son, to whom he is said to be a caring and responsible father.  
     
      
    13 The author of the pre-sentence report considered him to be unsuitable to serve a sentence by way of periodic detention, but only because of perceived conflict between his hours of employment and the hours required for attendance at a periodic detention centre. 
     
      
    14 The respondent gave evidence in the sentencing proceedings. He said that if it were only his work commitments that stood in the way of an order that any sentence be served by way of periodic detention, he would give up that employment. He was confident that he could obtain alternative employment. 
     
      
    15 He said that he had ceased alcohol consumption. As a result he had been abandoned and ostracised by his former friends. 
     
      
       
      Victim Impact Statement 
       
      
    16 I have already referred to the medical evidence concerning the physical consequences of the collision for Mr McGlone. Mr McGlone also provided a Primary Victim Impact Statement. He said that his life had been “on hold” since the accident, that he continued to have double vision, and that, as a result, he had not been able to obtain a driver’s licence. He said he suffered severe headaches and tired very easily. The headaches occurred about three times a week, lasted for hours and made him feel sick. He was unable to concentrate, was unable to hold a job; he suffered from nightmares and, initially, from insomnia. He had tried alcohol as sleep medication but found that his tolerance was reduced and alcohol consumption caused him to become aggressive. 
     
      
       
      The remarks on sentence  
       
      
    17 The sentencing judge noted the facts and circumstances of the offence, and the subjective circumstances to which I have referred. He noted that the respondent was an unlicensed driver and driving an unregistered vehicle and that he was on conditional liberty at the time. He did not explicitly treat these as aggravating features (which they are, both individually and in combination). Immediately after this reference, he expressly noted a submission made on behalf of the Crown that, as a consequence of the combination of these circumstances, the level of moral culpability in the respondent was high. He said that he was not convinced that that was so. 
     
      
    18 He then proceeded to refer to the decisions of this Court in R v Jurisic (1998) 45 NSWLR 209 and R v Whyte [2002] NSWCCA 343; 55 NSWLR 252. He made express reference to the features, itemised in Whyte as “frequently recurring” features of offences against s52A. 
     
      
    19 In this context, his Honour then made a number of findings of fact, or reached relevant conclusions. The following findings, conclusions and observations may be extracted from this part of the remarks on sentence:· that the injuries sustained by Mr McGlone were “not the worst case of grievous bodily harm”;· that Mr McGlone was the only person put at risk by the respondent’s conduct in driving the vehicle;· that there was no evidence of the extent to which the respondent was affected by liquor;· that there was no evidence that the respondent was driving aggressively, competitively, or showing off;· that the respondent had driven about two kilometres before the collision. 
     
      
    20 Having considered all of these matters, his Honour repeated that he was not satisfied that there was a high degree of moral culpability on the part of the respondent. 
     
      
    21 He apparently rejected a submission put on behalf of the respondent to the effect that Mr McGlone carried some degree of responsibility, having voluntarily entered the car with knowledge of the respondent’s alcohol consumption. 
     
      
    22 He then turned to the subjective features. It is unnecessary to repeat these. He noted a concession made on the part of the Crown that the plea of guilty, although entered at a relatively late stage, had a high degree of utilitarian value. 
     
      
    23 He concluded that the respondent had commenced his own rehabilitation; he noted he had given up alcohol and ceased association with his former peer group, was a good worker and displayed an attitude of responsibility. 
     
      
    24 He therefore proceeded to determine that special circumstances pursuant to s44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 existed, justifying departure from the ratio between the non-parole period and the total term there specified. He then imposed the sentence to which I have already referred, specifying that it be served by way of periodic detention. 
     
      
       
      The Crown appeal 
       
      
    25 The ground of appeal specified is that the sentence is manifestly inadequate. 
     
      
    26 Three specific matters were advanced in support of the ground. These were expressed as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “1. The sentencing judge erred in finding that the respondent’s moral culpability was not high; 
         
        2. full-time imprisonment was the appropriate sentence, not periodic detention; 
         
        3. his Honour did not specify any discount for the utilitarian value of the plea.” 
        
       
       
      1. Moral culpability: 
       
      
    27 Reference was made to the decision of this Court in R v Gardiner [2004] NSWCCA 365 in which it was said that all the circumstances are relevant to the assessment of the degree of moral culpability; and that a combination of circumstances might lead to a conclusion of a high (or, presumably, low) level of moral culpability. 
     
      
    28 On behalf of the Crown three relevant circumstances were identified: 
     
      
    · that the respondent was an unlicensed driver; · that he was driving an unregistered vehicle; and · that he was on conditional liberty at the time.  
     
      
     Reference was also made to the fact that he fled the scene of the accident leaving his injured friend.29 These circumstances in combination, the Crown argued, pointed to a finding that the respondent’s level of moral culpability was high. The Crown also challenged the view expressed by his Honour that only Mr McGlone was put at risk by the respondent’s driving; it pointed out that the respondent was driving on a public road; that the immediate cause of the collision was the crossing of the vehicle to the oncoming side of the road; and that while the collision might have occurred a relatively short distance from the beginning of the journey at the respondent’s home, the respondent was in fact intending to drive approximately 10 – 15 kilometres. 
     
      
    30 The Crown next challenged his Honour’s finding concerning the extent to which the respondent was affected by alcohol, pointing out that, on the agreed facts, it was obvious that a considerable quantity had been consumed and that the respondent later admitted “thrashing the vehicle”. 
     
      
    31 Next, the Crown challenged the finding that the injuries suffered by Mr McGlone were not in the worst case of grievous bodily harm. 
     
      
    32 Accordingly, the Crown argued that the respondent’s offence may be worse than that committed by the “typical” Whyte offender. 
     
      
    33 There is considerable substance in a great deal of what the Crown has put. I find it difficult to accept that the respondent’s degree of moral culpability was anything other than high; in addition to the matters cited by the Crown, it is of some significance that he had been urged, by his female friend, not to ride his motorcycle, but drove the car nevertheless. 
     
      
    34 I have concluded that the Crown is correct in challenging that ultimate conclusion. I am also satisfied that it was wrong to find that the number of persons put at risk was limited to the passenger in the respondent’s vehicle: on a public road, any number of people are potential victims. It is also difficult to sustain the view concerning the effect of the consumption of alcohol on the respondent’s driving. In this respect his own assessment – that he had been “thrashing” the vehicle – must be given some weight. The urging of his friend that he not ride his motorcycle can only reasonably be attributed to her perception of his state of intoxication. 
     
      
    35 It is correct, but perhaps unhelpful, to find that Mr McGlone’s injuries were not the worst case of grievous bodily harm; in the scale of cases seen in these courts, so much is obviously true. However, the injuries are far from minor, far from at the low end of the range of injuries amounting to grievous bodily harm and are, no doubt, of considerable significance to Mr McGlone. 
     
      
    36 I am therefore satisfied that there was error in the assessment of the respondent’s level of moral culpability, in the finding concerning the number of persons put at risk, in the undervalue ascribed to the respondent’s level of intoxication, and in the downplaying of the gravity of Mr McGlone’s injuries. 
     
      
       
      2. Full-time imprisonment? 
       
      
    37 It is well recognised that the imposition of a sentence to be served by way of periodic detention carries with it a significant element of leniency: 
     
      
    38 In R v Jurisic this Court promulgated as a guideline the following: 
     
      
       
        
        “(a) with a plea of guilty, wherever there is present to a material degree any aggravating factor involving the conduct of the offender, a custodial sentence (minimum plus additional or fixed term) of … less than two years (in the case of dangerous driving causing grievous bodily harm) should be exceptional; 
         
         
        (b) a non-custodial sentence should be exceptional and almost invariably confined to cases involving momentary inattention or mis-judgment.  
         
         
        (8) Once the threshold of abandoning responsibility has been reached the period of two … years imprisonment is a starting point. The presence of additional aggravating factors or their increased intensity will determine the actual sentence.” 
        
       
      
    39 It is not necessary to repeat the aggravating factors; they are set out above. They bring the respondent squarely within paragraph (a) of the guideline. It is also difficult to escape the conclusion that, in all of the circumstances, the respondent did abandon responsibility for his conduct –driving whilst unlicensed, driving an unregistered vehicle, doing so whilst on bail for another offence, together with the consumption of alcohol, are all indicators to that effect. In this respect his subsequent conduct (leaving the scene) is also relevant, indicating, even some time after the event, a failure or refusal to accept responsibility for his conduct. 
     
      
    40 There were, of course, features of the respondent’s case pointing in favour of some leniency. He was relatively young – just 22 years of age – at the time of the offence; although he faced a charge of assault, he had never previously been convicted; he had achieved significant rehabilitation of his own volition, having given up alcohol and his unsavoury associates; he was in steady employment and in a supportive and stabilising relationship with responsibility for a young child. 
     
      
    41 Guideline judgments were never intended as a straitjacket for sentencing judges; the sentencing discretion remains important, to enable judges to take account of the specific features of an individual case, and to ensure that a fitting sentence, in all the circumstances, is imposed: see Jurisic pp. 220 D – 221 E; Whyte, paragraph [78] – paragraph [116]. 
     
      
    42 In my opinion, it was certainly open to the judge to take a view of the respondent’s rehabilitation that justified the grant of leniency. The question is whether, in taking the course he did, he went too far. In almost two years between the date of the offence and the date of sentencing, the respondent transformed his life. It was appropriate and necessary to recognise this in the sentencing decision. 
     
      
    43 A lengthy period between offence and sentence can be relevant in a number of ways. In this case, as it sometimes does in others, it has worked to the respondent’s benefit. That is because he has taken full advantage of it to achieve reformation. For a sentencing judge, however, that combination of circumstances is apt to complicate the sentence exercise: it creates an almost irreconcilable conflict between, on the one hand, the demands of adequate retribution and denunciation, and, on the other, recognition of successful efforts towards rehabilitation. Particularly given the respondent’s youth and prior good character, I do not think it was wrong for the sentencing judge to place considerable emphasis upon his established rehabilitation. 
     
      
       
      3. The plea of guilty: 
       
      
    44 The final matter raised on behalf of the Crown concerned the discount allowed to the respondent by reason of his plea of guilty. It is not clear to me how Crown asserts that failure to specify the extent of the discount is somehow indicative of error. The discount was never precisely quantified, but it may be accepted that his Honour allowed the maximum available under the decision in R v Thomson; R v Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309; 49 NSWLR 383. On that assumption it may be taken that the starting point for the total term of the sentence was imprisonment for two years. (I recognise that the Jurisic guideline is expressly stated to be applicable to cases where there has been a plea of guilty.) The sentence imposed was therefore well below – by 25% - what Jurisic contemplates. The Crown having conceded that the plea had significant utilitarian value, despite its timing, there cannot be (and was not) any real complaint that the discount allowed was too great. If the Crown is entitled to any complaint her, it is that the discount was applied to a sentence that was impermissibly low. 
     
      
    45 On the hearing of the appeal this Court was presented with some additional material, tendered on the conventional basis that it was available to be used either if the court proposed to proceed to re-sentence, or in the event that the court were to consider the exercise of the residual discretion to decline to intervene in a Crown appeal which would otherwise have been made good. 
     
      
    46 There were two documents. One was a handwritten note, agreed to be from the respondent’s periodic detention supervisor. This gentleman spoke extremely highly of the respondent’s work during his periodic detention – he said that the respondent had worked “exceptionally well” and that: 
     
      
       
        
        “His ethics and work ability have been proven over and over in very difficult conditions.” 
        
       
      
    47 The second document presented some greater difficulties. It was a report of a medical practitioner who works exclusively in psychological medicine and counselling. What is difficult about this report is that it covers both material legitimately available for the two purposes mentioned, but also material which plainly was, or could have been, available to the sentencing judge and which is, therefore, strictly inadmissible in these proceedings. It is almost impossible to separate the properly available material from that which is unavailable. For example, the doctor said: 
     
      
       
        
        “As a result of this incident [the collision and offence] [the respondent] has developed a 
         major anxiety and depression disorder 
        .  
        It is now evident that [the respondent] suffered with both these conditions extensively prior to the charged incident 
        .” (bold in original; italics added) 
        
       
      
    48 Further, the doctor offered an account of the respondent’s childhood, adolescence and home life dramatically different from the “conventional upbringing” described in the pre-sentence report. 
     
      
    49 No reason was advanced to this Court why this material, which could and should have been available at sentencing, should now be taken into account. Although it is difficult to unravel, I am of the view that that material in the report which relates to matters occurring or existing up to the time of sentence should be discarded from consideration. 
     
      
    50 Nevertheless, there is material in the report which is properly available. For example, the doctor wrote: 
     
      
       
        
        “During his current weekend detention programme [the respondent] experiences major emotional distress at the commencement of each detention period. This is compounded by [the respondent’s] experience of the very harsh physical conditions of his weekend imprisonment.” 
        
       
      
    51 What follows is, presumably, intended to support the description of “very harsh physical conditions”; senior counsel who appeared for the respondent accepted that that description was, in light of the particularisation, somewhat overstated. However, the doctor went on to write: 
     
      
       
        
        “In speaking with [the respondent] it is evident that he experiences weekend detention as both emotionally and physically extremely punitive. On these occasions his anxiety disorder escalates to a ‘ 
        panic state 
        ’. A custodial sentence would have a profoundly adverse effect on his existing  
        anxiety and depression 
        .” (bold in original) 
        
       
      
    52 Traditionally, this Court exercises restraint in the determination of Crown appeals against sentence. Even where it decides to intervene and increase the sentence, it imposes a sentence at the bottom of the range of sentences that ought, at first instance, to have been imposed. 
     
      
    53 I am not persuaded that, in all of the circumstances, the sentence imposed was outside the range legitimately available to the sentencing judge; more confidently, I am satisfied that, if this Court were to intervene, the sentence it would impose contains so slight an increase upon that imposed at first instance, that the discretion to decline to intervene ought to be exercised. 
     
      
    54 I, accordingly, propose that the Crown appeal be dismissed. 
     
      
    55 HOWIE and BUDDIN JJ: We have had the benefit of reading in draft form the judgment of Simpson J. We agree with the order which her Honour proposes. However we have done so for somewhat different reasons. We agree with Simpson J, for the reasons which her Honour expresses, that the sentencing judge fell into error in his assessment of the respondent’s level of moral culpability. 
     
      
    56 Notwithstanding the favourable subjective features upon which the respondent was entitled to rely, this was a case which ought clearly, in our view, to have attracted a full-time custodial sentence at first instance. Accordingly, we have concluded that the Crown has made good its submission that the sentence imposed by the sentencing judge was manifestly inadequate. 
     
      
    57 Nonetheless, in our view this Court ought to exercise its discretion not to intervene. We have arrived at this conclusion having had regard to the additional material which has been placed before the Court, and also because of the various considerations referred to by Simpson J at pars 52-53 of her Honour’s judgment.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ AT CL: I agree with Howie J. 
     
      
    2 SIMPSON J: I have read in draft the judgment of Howie J and, subject to what follows, agree with the orders proposed and his Honour’s reasons. 
     
      
    3 I am, however, unable to subscribe to the description, contained in paragraph 8 of the draft, that the error in sentencing the applicant, in respect of two offences, to terms of imprisonment that exceeded the statutory maximum, was “technical”. To my mind such an error is fundamental. I do agree with the view that such an error, committed in the context of sentencing for multiple offences, does not necessarily infect the overall sentencing discretion, or the sentences imposed in respect of other offences. 
     
      
    4 HOWIE J: The applicant pleaded guilty before a magistrate to three offences of aggravated break, enter and commit a serious indictable offence contrary to s 112(2) of the Crimes Act and two offences of larceny. He was committed for sentence to the District Court where he adhered to his pleas of guilty to the five counts. The offences in Counts 1, 2, and 5 were the s 112(2) offences and Counts 3 and 4 were the larcenies. The applicant asked that on each of Counts 2, 3 and 4 the court take into account on a Form 1 an offence of take and drive a motor vehicle and on Count 2 a further offence of drive in a manner dangerous to the public. 
     
      
    5 The maximum penalty for each of the s 112(2) offences was imprisonment for 20 years. There was also an applicable standard non-parole period of imprisonment for 5 years. The maximum penalty for each of the larceny offences was imprisonment for 5 years; see s 117 of the Crimes Act. 
     
      
    6 On 21 April 2006 Maguire DCJ (the Judge) sentenced the applicant as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Count 1: a minimum term of 18 months imprisonment with a balance of term of 6 months. 
         
         
        Count 2: a minimum term of 18 months imprisonment with a balance of term of 6 months. 
         
         
        Count 3: a minimum term of 4 years with a balance of term of 16 months. 
         
         
        Count 4: a minimum term of 4 years with a balance of term of 16 months. 
         
         
        Count 5: a minimum term of 5 years with a balance of term of 20 months. 
         
        
       
      
    7 Each of the sentences was to commence on 15 June 2005 and, therefore, the overall sentence is one of 6 years 8 months with an overall non-parole period of 5 years to expire on 14 June 2010, the date upon which the applicant is eligible to be released to parole. The date of 15 June 2005 was the date of the expiration of a sentence that the applicant had been serving, being the balance of parole on an earlier sentence. 
     
      
    8 It should be noted immediately that the sentence imposed on each of Counts 3 and 4 exceeded the maximum penalty prescribed for the offence of larceny. There is a ground of appeal raising this complaint and it must of course succeed. In some circumstances the fact that one or more of a number of sentences for various offences passed on an offender exceed the applicable maximum penalty may not result in a conclusion that the sentencing discretion completely miscarried because that error could not have influenced the sentences in respect of the other offences or the overall sentence imposed. To that extent the error may be considered as technical: see R v Tadrosse [2005] NSWCCA 145. Whether in this case the error in exceeding the maximum penalty for two of the offences indicates that the discretion of the Judge has generally miscarried will be considered shortly. 
     
      
       
        
        The facts 
        
       
      
    9 The facts were not in dispute. They were summarised by the Judge in his sentencing remarks as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Count one: 
         
         
        On 15 December the offender broke into the home of Rochelle Haywood while she and members of her family were asleep. He stole various valuable items to the value in excess of four and a half thousand dollars. 
         
         
        Count two: 
         
         
        Before 5am on 20 January the offender arrived at the home of Martin Brala. He was driving a stolen car. He broke into the home and stole valuable electronic equipment. Mr Brala disturbed him and when the offender drove off Mr Brala jumped onto the bonnet of the car. The offender continued to drive and the victim was dislodged and fell to the driveway. 
         
         
        Count three: 
         
         
        In the early afternoon of 2 February 2005 the offender was in a supermarket at Green Valley when the victim opened the cash register to lodge two dollars paid for an item purchased by the offender he grabbed money from the drawer. He drove away in a car previously stolen. 
         
         
        Count four: 
         
         
        On the following afternoon the offender, in the presence of a shop assistant dislodged a till from the counter in a video sore at Mt Pritchard. The till burst open and the offender grabbed two $50 dollar notes and ran away. 
         
        
       
       
        
         
        Count five: 
         
         
        Later the same day the offender broke into the home of fifty-six year old Miss Simmonds. He demanded money of which she had none available. He then took certain electronic equipment and other property to the value of more than $10,000. Thereafter at knifepoint he forced her out of her home. She managed to break free and the offender drove off in the victim’s car. He was arrested the following day. 
         
        
       
      
    10 It is worth making some observations on the nature of the charges. The serious indictable offence in each of the s 112(2) offences was stealing. The matter of aggravation relied upon in Counts 1 and 2 was that the applicant knew that persons were present in the premises where the offences were committed; see s 105A(1)(f) of the Crimes Act. In respect of Count 5 the matter of aggravation charged was that the applicant deprived Ms Simmonds of her liberty: see s 105A(e). However, the Crown made it clear on sentencing that it was also relying in respect of Count 5 upon the presence of two other aggravating features, although not charged, being that the applicant knew that there was a person present in the premises and that he was armed with an offensive weapon: see s 105A(a). It has been held that the Crown is entitled to rely upon other factors in aggravation in addition to that charged: R v Li (NSWCCA, unreported, 9 July 1997). 
     
      
    11 The short summary of facts given by the Judge in respect of Count 5 hardly discloses the extent of the applicant’s criminality and it needs some expansion. As she was preparing to go to bed and had just put out her light, the victim became aware that there was someone inside the house. She went to the bedroom door where the applicant confronted her while holding a torch that he shone in her face. He told the victim to get on her bed and place her hands behind her back. He demanded money and, when she said she had none, accused her of lying. He said, “I am already upset. I have been chased by the police. I need money”. The applicant searched the bedroom and took items of jewellery. 
     
      
    12 When he was finished, he shone the torch in her face, placed his hand at the back of her neck and guided her to her daughter’s room. He again told her to sit on the bed and put her hands behind her back. He put items of property in the room, including DVDs, into a suitcase. They then went to the lounge room where the applicant disconnected a DVD player and put it into the case. He then told the victim that they were going to the bank and that he would leave her car in Miller, a nearby suburb. The applicant threatened the victim with a kitchen knife and said, “Don’t make me do what I don’t want to do”. 
     
      
    13 The applicant forced the victim to leave the premises and was in possession of her car keys. He pushed her outside the house toward the garage by holding the back of her neck. She said to the applicant, “You don’t need to do this”. The applicant replied, “I told you I’d do this mum”. They went to the garage door and, when the applicant bent down to unlock it, the victim made her escape. She ran into the street. She saw the applicant run from her property but shortly he returned saying that he was taking her car. He opened the garage door and drove away in the victim’s vehicle. The property stolen from inside the house was valued at over $10,000. 
     
      
       
        
        The subjective case 
        
       
      
    14 The applicant was born on 10 May 1982 and aged 24 at the time of sentence. He had a record for offences of dishonesty since 1999 including numerous offences of taking motor vehicles and driving offences including negligent and furious driving. On 26 July 2002 he was dealt with in the District Court for offences of robbery while armed with a dangerous weapon. He was sentenced to imprisonment for 3 years with a non-parole period of 1 year 9 months. He also received a sentence of imprisonment for driving in a manner dangerous. While serving the sentence for the armed robberies he was sentenced to imprisonment in the Local Court for an offence of break, enter and steal. 
     
      
    15 On 28 September 2003 he was sentenced to imprisonment for a number of offences including break, enter and steal, and taking a motor vehicle. The longest sentence imposed was imprisonment for 20 months with a non-parole period of 15 months. The applicant was released to parole from that sentence on 12 November 2004. The first of the current offences was committed on 15 December 2004. His parole was revoked on 21 January 2005 and from 1 February 2005 until 14 June 2005 he was serving the balance of parole. 
     
      
    16 The applicant had been subject at various times to good behaviour bonds, community service orders, and parole with supervision. A pre-sentence report in evidence before the Judge stated that the applicant responded poorly to his latest period of supervision and was breached for further offences and “poor reporting”. He had experienced a “disturbed upbringing” because of his parents’ separation when he was aged 10. His father was a drug addict who spent time in custody. In his teens the applicant began abusing drugs and committing offences. He received only a basic education and had rarely worked. The applicant reported that he had been in the community for a total of three years since the age of 15. He had abused both heroin and cocaine. He said that he committed the present offences as “a means of supporting his drug habit and for basic survival as he had no income”. The officer preparing the report was of the view that his “pattern of antisocial behaviour” was entrenched. 
     
      
    17 There was in evidence a report from a psychologist. It contains considerable detail as to the applicant’s upbringing, which was described as being one of “dysfunction, abuse, neglect and instability”. His upbringing left the applicant “highly vulnerable to the development of emotional, social and behavioural difficulties”. The applicant reported that he was diagnosed with ADHD at the age of 13 or 14 and received medication to treat it. The applicant, however, told the psychologist that he did not believe that he suffered from that disorder and stopped taking medication when he left school. He gave a history of what the psychologist described as “significant substance abuse and dependence”. He expressed motivation to abstain from drugs but had no interest in counselling, as he believed he was the only one who could stop himself from using drugs. The psychologist described this attitude as “somewhat naive and unrealistic”. 
     
      
    18 The psychologist was of the opinion that the applicant “will benefit from intervention and support in a variety of areas in order to assist him in addressing his crimogenic needs”. Notwithstanding the applicant’s attitude to drug counselling, the psychologist believed that he would benefit from “counselling intervention designed to assist him in developing relapse prevention skills so that he might have a better chance of maintaining abstinence in the community”. 
     
      
    19 The applicant gave evidence before the Judge. In effect he confirmed much of what was contained in the reports as to his background. He stated that his father introduced him to armed robberies and selling and using drugs from about the age of 15. He said that he was no longer using heroin or cocaine. He gave evidence as to the circumstances of the offences. He said that he went into Ms Simmonds’s premises as he was trying to hide. He did not intend to hurt her but to make his escape and get money to support his addiction. He said that he was committed to change and had undertaken inquiries about getting assistance from counselling while in custody. 
     
      
       
        
        The sentencing remarks 
        
       
      
    20 The sentencing remarks were very brief comprising mainly the summary of the facts set out above and a large quotation from the pre-sentence report as to the applicant’s background. The Judge acknowledged that the applicant had given expressions of genuine contrition but doubted “his ability to deliver on rehabilitation”. The Judge then said: 
     
      
       
        
         
        His guilty plea is taken into account on sentence. It serves to achieve a lesser non-parole period than that provided for by law in some of these cases and in that regard I allow a twenty per cent discount. However in respect of the fifth count that consideration is overridden by my view that he demonstrates a level of criminality above the middle of the range. The terror that he inflicted on the aging female victim in that case deserves to be marked with a severe sentence. The sentences demanded here should act as a deterrent to this offender and others. 
         
         
        Having regard to the varying degrees of severity of the sentences I propose I see no call for accumulation 
         
         
        I see no special circumstances for the purposes of s 44(2) of the  
        Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. 
         
         
        I have examined these sentences carefully and regard them as properly reflecting the totality of the offender’s criminality. 
        
       
      
    21 This passage is the sum total of any attempt by the Judge to analyse what was not an uncomplicated sentencing exercise and to explain how he was deriving both the individual sentences and the total period of custody that he imposed upon the applicant. There is no attempt by his Honour to justify any of the sentences apart from that for Count 5. 
     
      
    22 When the sentences for Counts 1 to 4 are examined against one another, they are seen to be illogical having regard to the individual facts of each matter. They pay only lip service, if that, to the requirement that a court consider the appropriate sentence for each particular offence before considering the totality of the criminality for which the offender is to be punished. For example, it is impossible to comprehend how the Judge could conclude that a sentence for an impulsive act of stealing $100 from retail premises (Count 4) could warrant a sentence of almost three times the length of that imposed for breaking into a home, knowing that a person or persons were present and stealing property worth thousands of dollars (Count 1). And this is even without having regard to the maximum penalties prescribed for the offences, or the fact that the maximum penalty for the offence in Count 1 was four times that prescribed for Count 4. 
     
      
    23 There is no attempt by the Judge to explain, in respect of Counts 1 and 2, why he was reducing the non-parole period below the standard non-period applicable for those offences, other than by reason of the 20 per cent discount for the plea. This was notwithstanding s 54B(3) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act that mandates that the court “identify in the record of its reasons each factor that it took into account”. It has been held by this Court on more than one occasion that the fact of a plea of guilty does not relieve the judge from complying fully with that section: see for example R v Zegura [2006] NSWCCA 230. 
     
      
    24 There is no attempt by the Judge, in accordance with decisions of this Court, to hypothesise what is an offence in the middle of the range of seriousness for an offence falling within s 112(2) of the Crimes Act in order to determine where in the range of seriousness the particular matters before the court fell: R v Way (2004) NSWLR 168 at [74]-[77]; R v AJP (2004) 150 A Crim R 575. 
     
      
    25 There is no reference to s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act or the relevant factors that needed to be considered in determining the seriousness of the offences and whether, and to what degree, they should lead to a departure from the standard non-parole period. Section 54(3) of the Act provides: 
     
      
       
        
         
        The reasons for which the court may set a non-parole period that is longer or shorter than the standard non-parole period are only those referred to in section 21A. 
        
       
      
    26 But even without a consideration of either s 54B(3) or s 21A the Judge ought to have made some reference to factors that were of significance in determining the sentence to be imposed upon the applicant. For example, there is not even a passing reference to the fact that the applicant was on parole at the time of the offences, an aggravating factor of particular significance both at common law and under s 21A(2)(j). 
     
      
    27 The Judge’s decision to make all sentences concurrent is illogical and erroneous in principle. His Honour stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Having regard to the varying degrees of severity of the sentences I propose I see no call for accumulation. 
        
       
       
      I accept that the decision whether to make sentences concurrent or cumulative, and to what degree, is discretionary:  
      R v Hammoud 
       (2000) 118 A Crim R 66. But generally speaking that discretion is informed by the principle of totality:  
      R v MMK 
       [2006] NSWCCA 272. The fact that the offences have common factors or may be seen as part of the one course of criminal conduct is not decisive. In  
      Cahyadi v R 
       [2007] NSWCCA 1 the exercise of the discretion was explained as follows: 
       
        
         
        27 ….. there is no general rule that determines whether sentences ought to be imposed concurrently or consecutively. The issue is determined by the application of the principle of totality of criminality: can the sentence for one offence comprehend and reflect the criminality for the other offence? If it can, the sentences ought to be concurrent otherwise there is a risk that the combined sentences will exceed that which is warranted to reflect the total criminality of the two offences. If not, the sentences should be at least partly cumulative otherwise there is a risk that the total sentence will fail to reflect the total criminality of the two offences. This is so regardless of whether the two offences represent two discrete acts of criminality or can be regarded as part of a single episode of criminality. Of course it is more likely that, where the offences are discrete and independent criminal acts, the sentence for one offence cannot comprehend the criminality of the other. Similarly, where they are part of a single episode of criminality with common factors, it is more likely that the sentence for one of the offences will reflect the criminality of both. 
         
        
       
       
      The discretion is not properly exercised by making the sentences for all offences concurrent but increasing the severity of the sentences progressively until a sentence is reached that will encompass the total criminality for all of the offences for which sentence is being passed. Yet this is what the Judge appears to have done. 
       
      
    28 In any event it was an error for the Judge to impose “varying degrees of severity” of the sentences if what he meant was that the sentences imposed for the offences would increase progressively regardless of whether any individual sentence reflected the criminality of the particular offence. As has already been noted, there was no justification in sentencing practice or theory for the sentences for Counts 3 and 4 to be more severe than the sentences for Counts 1 and 2. Quite the contrary there was every reason for the sentences for the larceny offences to be considerably less than those imposed for the s 112(2) offences simply because the criminality of the larcenies was nowhere near as serious as the break and enter offences. 
     
      
       
        
        The discount for the plea of guilty 
        
       
      
    29 The applicant complains that the Judge erred in failing to give him the benefit of a discount for the utilitarian benefit of the plea of guilty on Count 5. This complaint is based upon the passage quoted from the sentencing remarks above where the Judge, having indicated that a discount of 20 per cent would apply “to achieve a lesser sentence than that required by law in some of these case”, went on to state that “in respect of the fifth count that consideration is overridden by my view that he demonstrates a level of criminality above the middle range”. 
     
      
    30 It must be acknowledged that it is not easy to understand the relevant passage in the remarks. However, I do not believe that this complaint is justified. It seems to me that the Judge was intending in that passage to convey the following line of reasoning. In “some of these cases” (presumably Counts 1 and 2) the discount for the plea of guilty would result in a non-parole period less than “that provided for by the law” (that is the relevant standard non-parole period applicable to those counts). But in respect of Count 5, “that consideration” (that is the reduction of the standard non-parole period by reason of the discount for the guilty plea) was “overridden” by the seriousness of the offence. Therefore, in respect of Count 5 the discount for the plea would not result in a non-parole period less than the standard non-parole period because the criminality involved in that offence was greater than the mid-range of seriousness for a s 112(2) offence. So that had it not been for the plea of guilty, the non-parole period would have been greater than the standard non-parole period. The effect of the discount for the plea, however, was to reduce the otherwise appropriate non-parole period to the applicable standard non-parole. 
     
      
    31 If this was not what the Judge was attempting to convey by the passage, and I accept that there is room for argument about what was meant, I do not understand why the Judge imposed the standard non-parole period for Count 5 notwithstanding that he found that the offence was above the mid-range of seriousness. 
     
      
       
        
        Was the sentence manifestly excessive? 
        
       
      
    32 Although I would not uphold the complaint about the failure to take into account the discount for the plea of guilty, it does not follow that the attack upon the sentence for Count 5 necessarily fails. The applicant also complains that the sentence is manifestly excessive. It is argued that the offence in Count 5 did not warrant a sentence of 6 years 8 months having regard to the range of seriousness of offences that could be committed in breach of s 112(2) and in light of the statistical information available for sentences imposed for this type of offence. 
     
      
    33 For my part I find statistical information of less significance when dealing with standard non-parole period cases than might otherwise be the case. If the offence is one of mid-range seriousness, then, subject to any reasons for departing from that sentence in the particular case before the court, the appropriate sentence to impose is the standard non-parole period regardless of what the statistical information discloses. In the present case the statistical information presented to the Court reveals that the highest non-parole period imposed for a s 112(2) offence was 4 years and 6 months for all offenders, presumably including those who were convicted after trial. That means that no person was sentenced to a standard non-parole period even where prima facie it applied. I find it somewhat surprising that, in the more than four years during which the standard non-parole regime has applied, no one has committed an offence under s 112(2) of such seriousness that a sentence equal to, or greater than, the standard non-parole period was warranted. 
     
      
       
       
       
        
        Offence of mid-range of seriousness under s 112(2) 
        
       
      
    34 However, it is not an easy task to make sense of, and apply, the standard non-parole period provisions in relation to s 112(2) offences. Firstly, the standard non-parole period is 5 years as against a head sentence of 20 years. One would expect as a matter of logic and the application of ordinary sentencing principles that, if an offence was hypothetically of the mid-range of seriousness, it would carry a sentence of half the maximum penalty, that is a total term of ten years and, according to the statutory proportion under s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, a non-parole period of seven and a half years. What then is to be made of the fact that the standard non-parole period is only 5 years? Does this disclose the intention of Parliament that the courts should take a more benign view of an offence under s 112(2) than the maximum penalty would seem to suggest? How does a court determine the sentence where the seriousness of the offence is somewhere above the mid-range of seriousness but below the most serious category of an offence under the section: by having more regard to the standard non-parole period or to the maximum penalty? 
     
      
    35 Secondly, the section can cover a very diverse range of offending. It is an element of the offence that a “serious indictable offence” is committed. But that category of offence includes any offence that is punishable by life or for a term of 5 years or more; see s 4 of the Crimes Act. Larceny is punishable by a term of five years and, therefore, is, on its face, at the lower end of seriousness for the type of offences that would fall within s 112(2). This might suggest that any offence under s 112(2), where the serious indictable offence is stealing, cannot be within the midrange of seriousness because there are many more serous offences that may give rise to a s 112(2) offence. For example, the offence committed in the premises might be a sexual assault committed on a child or an armed robbery. 
     
      
    36 This problem was considered in R v Huynh [2005] NSWCCA 220. Simpson J, with whom the other members of the Court agreed, stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        [27]………..The assessment of where the offence lies in the range of offences of its type is to be made by reference to all of the facts and circumstances of the offence, and to the range of offences of its kind which come before the court. One circumstance which is here of relevance in that assessment is the quantity and value of the property stolen. It is not to the point that the property was recovered. It was, in fact, stolen, before being recovered. The fact that the maximum penalty for stealing barely takes that offence into s112(2) does not of itself determine where the offence lies in the scale of gravity of offences against s112(2). Certainly, one might ordinarily expect that offences involving violence would be regarded as more serious than stealing. But that does not preclude a finding that an offence under s112(2), where the “serious indictable offence” is larceny, being classified as in the middle of the range. 
        
       
      
    37 Therefore, in determining whether the offence falls within the mid-range of seriousness, the court has to have regard to the nature of the offence committed in the premises, including its seriousness as against offences of its type generally. Where that offence is larceny, the guideline judgement in R v Ponfield (1999) 48 NSWLR 327 might assist in determining the relevant factors to be considered in the evaluation of the seriousness of the offence. So the type of premises entered, the nature and value of the property taken, and whether there is substantial damage to, or ransacking of, the contents of the premises will be relevant considerations. 
     
      
    38 It is also necessary for the court to consider the element of aggravation charged, both as to its nature and what was actually done that gave rise to the aggravating factor. The number of aggravating factors present and the severity of them individually and in combination will also be relevant matters. Not all aggravating factors are of the same seriousness generally speaking. For example, the infliction of actual bodily harm might not be as serious as the fact that the offender is armed with an offensive weapon. The nature of the weapon and the actual threats made with it will be of significance. However, when consideration is given to any injury inflicted on the victim it will be relevant to take into account whether it was caused intentionally or recklessly. The extent of the injury will be significant but it should be noted that the malicious infliction of grievous bodily harm or a wounding leads to a more serious offence under s 112(3). 
     
      
    39 As to the aggravating feature of knowing that a person or person is present in the premises, matters of relevance will be the type of person present in the premises, for example whether there was a child or some other vulnerable person present, and whether the offender knew that the person or persons in the premises were particularly vulnerable. The time of day will be relevant so that if it is late at night, when the persons in the premises are likely to be asleep, this might indicate that the offence is more serious because the persons are for that reason more vulnerable. 
     
      
    40 In relation to the aggravating factor that the offender deprives a person of his or her liberty, the nature and period of the confinement will obviously be relevant. It will clearly be particularly aggravating where the person is taken hostage or removed by force or threats from the premises for some purpose of the offender, as it will be if the person is bound or gagged. 
     
      
       
        
        Was Count 5 above the mid-range of seriousness? 
        
       
      
    41 The Judge found that this offence was above the mid-range of serious for this offence but without explaining why he came to the assessment. Although this Court will not normally interfere with such a finding; Mulato v R [2006] NSWCCA 282, it is more likely to do so where no, or insufficient, reasons are given to justify it: Dang v R [2005] NSWCCA 430. Having regard to the range of offences that can arise under the section, I do not believe that it was open to the Judge to come to that conclusion. In my opinion the offence was one of mid-range of seriousness. 
     
      
    42 Although the offence committed in the premises was larceny, and not a particularly serious example of that offence, there were three aggravating features, two of them of particular seriousness. The use of the knife and the particular threat, “don’t make me do what I don’t want to do” were intended to terrify the victim. On one view the use of the knife converted the larceny into an armed robbery. But it was more significant than that because the use of the knife was intended to make the victim compliant in leaving the house with him for the purposes of obtaining money from her bank account. The aggravating feature of depriving the victim of her liberty was potentially a serious example of its kind because the victim was to be forced to accompany him out of her house so that she would be constantly under threat of the knife until the applicant’s purpose was achieved. But as it happened the victim was able to escape shortly after leaving the house and so the aggravating feature lost much of its force. 
     
      
    43 As has been noted, the applicant was on parole for similar offences. In my opinion that was an aggravating feature that in combination with an objective evaluation of the offence as being of mid-range of seriousness pushed the appropriate non-parole period above five years. There was no reason to find special circumstances having regard to the numerous opportunities the applicant had been given to address his drug problem in the past. The Judge was correct to have doubts about his prospects for rehabilitation. However, there should be a 20 per cent discount for the plea. 
     
      
       
        
        Should the Court intervene? 
        
       
      
    44 In my opinion the Judge’s sentencing discretion miscarried in a number of ways. It is not simply the case that I believe that the sentence for Count 5 is excessive and based upon an erroneous assessment of the seriousness of the offence for the purposes of applying the standard non-parole provisions. In my opinion the structure of the sentences generally was based upon errors as to the appropriate sentences for the larceny offences and the manner in which the issue of totality could be resolved. Therefore, it falls to this Court to exercise the discretion afresh within the confines of the power of this Court on an offender’s appeal. 
     
      
    45 In doing so the Court is to take into account an affidavit filed on behalf of the applicant for the purposes of re-sentencing him. That affidavit annexed a number of certificates and other gaol documents, including a letter from the applicant to his solicitor, relevant to the applicant’s endeavours at rehabilitation since being returned to custody. However, I do not believe that the material in the affidavit significantly impacts upon the overall sentence to be imposed upon the applicant. Notwithstanding the rehabilitative steps he has taken since he was returned to custody, in light of the fact that he was on parole at the time of the commission of these offences and the other opportunities he has been given to overcome his drug addiction, a sentence should be imposed that reflects both general and specific deterrence. 
     
      
    46 In my opinion the sentences imposed on Counts 1 and 2 were lenient, in light of the fact that the applicant was on parole for similar offending and having regard to the applicable standard non-parole period. The sentence for Count 5 was excessive and should be reduced. However, in my opinion there should have been partial accumulation between each of the sentences for the three s 112(2) offences. But this Court is effectively limited to the sentence imposed by the Judge, there being no Crown appeal, and an appropriate degree of accumulation would lead to a sentence in excess of that imposed upon the applicant. I do not believe that the criminality involved in the larceny offences when compared with that in Count 5 requires that the sentences for those offences be made cumulative between themselves or with Count 5. 
     
      
    47 Although the sentences imposed by the Judge for counts 3, 4 and 5 must be quashed and the applicant re-sentenced, in my opinion no lesser non-parole period than that imposed by the Judge is warranted having regard to the totality of the criminality of the offences for which the applicant was sentenced. There are to be fixed terms for each of the larceny offences by reason of the fact that those sentences are to be served concurrently with the sentence imposed for Count 5. Although the parole period is less than a third of the non-parole period for Count 5 this is because in my view the applicant should serve no lesser minimum period of custody than 5 years and the Court cannot increase the overall sentence to give the applicant the advantage of a longer period on parole. 
     
      
       
       
      
    48 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      1. Leave to appeal is granted and the appeal is allowed in respect of the sentences imposed for Counts 3, 4, and 5. 
       
       
      2. The sentences for Counts 3, 4 and 5 are quashed and on those Counts the applicant is sentenced as follows: 
       
        
         
        (a) On Counts 3 and 4 the applicant is sentenced to a fixed term of two years to commence on 15 December 2005 and expire on 14 December 2007. 
         
         
        (b) On Count 5 the applicant is sentenced to a non-parole period of 4 years and 6 months to date from 15 December 2005 and to expire on 14 June 2008, the date upon which the applicant is eligible to be released to parole. There is a balance of term of 14 months to commence on 15 June 2008. 
         
        
       
      
     15 March 2007 
      
     49. 
      THE COURT: 
      Since judgment in this matter was published it has been brought to the Court's attention that there is an inconsistency between the term of sentence imposed for count 5 and the dates specified for the expiration of the balance of term and the non-parole period. As would be clear from the reasons for judgment, it was the intention of the Court that the term of sentence to be imposed was as pronounced but the dates need to be corrected. Therefore, the sentence for count 5 should read: 
      
      
     On Count 5 the applicant is sentenced to a non-parole period of 4 years and 6 months to date from 15 December 2005 and to expire on 14 June 2010, the date upon which the applicant is eligible to be released to parole. There is a balance of term of 14 months to commence on 15 June 2010.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 SIMPSON J: I agree with Howie J. 
     
      
    2 HOWIE J: The applicant pleaded guilty to four offences relating to the supply of prohibited drugs. There were two offences contrary to s 25A of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act of on-going supply, and two offences contrary to s 25(2) of that Act, one offence of supplying not less than a large commercial quantity and an offence of supplying not less than a commercial quantity. The offences under s 25A carried relevantly a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 20 years. The offence in respect of the large commercial quantity carried a maximum penalty of life imprisonment with a standard non-parole of 15 years and that in relation to a commercial quantity imprisonment for 20 years with a standard non-parole period of 10 years. There were also matters dealt with under s 166 of the Criminal Procedure Act including an offence of supply and five offences of drive while disqualified. 
     
      
    3 On 29 March 2006 Judge Sorby (the Judge) sentenced the applicant to an overall sentence of 9 years and 6 months with an overall non-parole period of 7 years to date from 21 April 2005. The applicant is eligible to be released to parole on 20 October 2014. The longest sentence was that imposed for the offence of supplying a large commercial quantity being a non-parole period of five years from 21 April 2007 with a balance of term of 2 years and 6 months. The other sentences were varying periods of imprisonment to be served by fixed terms. There was an accumulation between the sentences of 2 years resulting in the overall sentence indicated above. 
     
      
    4 The applicant relies upon the following grounds of appeal: 
     
      
       
        
         
        1. In all the circumstances of the case the sentence imposed is manifestly excessive. 
         
         
        2. In imposing the sentence that he did the sentencing Judge gave insufficient weight to the appellant’s subjective circumstances. 
         
         
        3. The learned sentencing judge, while properly finding special circumstances, erred in law by failing to properly reflect that finding in the actual sentence imposed.  
         
         
        4. The learned sentencing judge erred in law when finding that “a level of planning in the offences on the part of the offender” was an aggravating circumstance. 
         
         
        5. The learned sentencing judge erred in law when finding that the appellant’s prior record was an aggravating circumstance. 
         
         
        6. The learned sentencing judge erred in law in imposing an overall head sentence of 9.5 years with a non-parole period of 7 years. 
         
        
       
      
    5 The first offence of on-going supply related to a period between 23 December 2004 and 21 January 2005. During that period the applicant supplied various drugs including cocaine and amphetamine to an undercover police officer. On 24 December the officer and the applicant met and, although he could not supply the drugs sought, the applicant told the officer that he had some “caps” in which he had placed speed. He sold four for $100. The applicant told the officer that he “could get anything you want, Goey, Coke”. The drug supplied on this occasion was 2.34 grams of Ketamine. This is the equivalent of a small quantity prescribed for that drug. 
     
      
    6 There was a further supply to the officer on 30 December when the officer was sold five pills (including one extra for the officer’s inconvenience in having to wait for the drugs) and a quantity of what was said to be cocaine. The officer paid $200. The tablets had no prohibited drug in them and the powder was .18 grams of methylamphetamine. They met again on 10 January 2005 and the officer was supplied with a bag with four pills and some white powder for $200. The pills were said to be a gift. The tablets were .61 grams of ecstasy and the powder 0.42 grams of cocaine. On 12 January the officer bought three pills for $100 and was given an extra blue one for free. The three tablets amounted to .9 grams of ecstasy and the blue tablet contained no drug. 
     
      
    7 During their conversations the applicant told the officer that he could obtain various types of drugs and on one occasion said that he could get “anything you want as many as you want”. 
     
      
    8 The second on-going supply offence took place over the period 3 March 2005 and 1 April 2005. Ketamine, ecstasy and cocaine were supplied to another undercover operative. On 11 March 2005 the applicant met the undercover officer to whom he had sold drugs in the first offence and was introduced to the second officer. He purchased five tablets for $150 and enquired as to the price for a thousand. The applicant said it would be “15, 16” but said that he had mates that bought them for $10,000. He said, “When I deliver 10,000 I get a few hundred free for myself”. They discussed the supply of “ice” a sample of which was given to the officer. Of the five tablets, four were 1.03 grams of ecstasy and the fifth was Ketamine. There were no drugs present in the sample. 
     
      
    9 The officer met the applicant on 24 March and purchased 50 tablets for $1240 being 24.5 grams of ecstasy. They spoke on 30 March to discuss prices and quantities for imported pills. On 31 March they met and discussed the price of 2,000 pills, the applicant saying that he would need a couple of days to organise a bulk quantity. The officer then paid $3,000 and was supplied with 37.4 grams of ecstasy. It should be noted that a traffickable quantity of ecstasy is 1.25 grams. 
     
      
    10 The offence of supplying a large commercial quantity related to an attempt by the applicant to supply the second officer with ecstasy between 30 March 2005 and 13 April 2005. On 3 April the applicant contacted the officer and there was a discussion about the price for “1 triple 0” of ecstasy. The applicant said that his supplier was a cousin in Canberra. The officer said he wanted 3,000 pills. The applicant rang him on 6 April to say that he preferred to supply 1000 and then 2000 and they discussed how the money would be paid. On 8 April the applicant confirmed that the officer wanted 3,000 tablets as he did not want to get left with any. On 12 April there were unsuccessful attempts to organise the handover of the tablets and the applicant told the officer he should consider that the price had already dropped to $15.50 per tablet. On 14 April the applicant apologised that the sale could not proceed. There was further contact between the two culminating in the applicant arranging to meet the officer on 21 April. A large commercial quantity is 500 grams. 3,000 tablets would have weighed over 600 grams. 
     
      
    11 The offence of supplying not less than a commercial quantity related to a sale of 1002 tablets to the second officer on 21 April. The tablets contained 211.21 grams of ecstasy. A commercial quantity is 125 grams. The applicant was arrested after the supply took place. 
     
      
    12 The applicant was born on 19 May 1983 and hence was aged 22 at the time of sentence. He was born in Lebanon but came to Australia with his mother and siblings when aged 3 years. In 1999 he was the victim of a serious assault from which he sustained head and other injuries including a permanent brain injury resulting in impairment to his memory and concentration. He also suffers from anxiety and depression. He normally lives with his mother and would do so when released from custody. 
     
      
    13 He had a record of offences dating back to 2002. On 4 April 2002 he was placed on a two year bond for a charge of supply and other drugs offences. On 26 September 2002 he received a six month suspended sentence for offences of taking a conveyance and goods in custody. On 2 October 2003 he received a suspended sentence of six months for an offence of supply, for three charges of possession and a charge of driving while disqualified. 
     
      
    14 A pre-sentence report disclosed that the applicant had been under supervision in 2002 but was withdrawn from an alcohol and drug course because of his inability “to cope in a group environment” because of his brain injury. Apparently, also as a result of this condition, he missed appointments and otherwise failed to comply with the requirements of supervision so that he was relieved of those obligations. The principal issues to have been addressed by supervision was substance abuse. The officer preparing the report indicated that the applicant had received psychological counselling while in custody and appeared to be coping satisfactorily with imprisonment. At the time of sentencing he was awaiting surgery for a hernia. 
     
      
    15 The report states that, following the assault upon him, the applicant developed a dependency on illegal drugs including amphetamine and cocaine. He often took near fatal doses of amphetamine. He had participated in individual counselling sessions while in custody and completed a drug awareness programme. However, it was considered that he would require close supervision and support in order to maintain drug abstinence while in the community. There was also some material that suggested that the applicant had a gambling problem and some of the money he obtained from offending was used to discharge gambling debts. The applicant told the officer preparing the pre-sentence report that he sold drugs to support his own addiction. 
     
      
    16 There was in evidence a report from a psychiatrist, Dr Roberts. He diagnosed the applicant as suffering from a “substance abuse disorder” for which he would need psychiatric assistance and regular monitoring of his drug usage. After interviewing the applicant’s sister, the psychiatrist formed the view that, based upon the applicant’s history of substance abuse and his limited intelligence, “he would not be likely to have the capacity to be the principal in the organisation of a business”. 
     
      
    17 One of the applicant’s five siblings, a sister, gave evidence before the Judge. She told of a “dramatic change” that she had observed in the applicant since he had been placed in custody as a result of his abstinence from prohibited drugs. She thought that his attitude was more mature. He had expressed regrets for his offences. There was evidence that the applicant would have work available to him when released. 
     
      
    18 The Judge gave the applicant the benefit of a 25 per cent reduction in the sentences by reason of his pleas of guilty on the basis that they were given at the first reasonable opportunity. He said this about the seriousness of the offences and the application of the standard non-parole provisions: 
     
      
       
        
         
        In my opinion but for the offender’s pleas to the section 25(2) charges the offences would be clearly within mid range, but because of the pleas they fall below it. The facts of these two offences reveal a person who held himself out as being able to access, at short notice, a substantial amount of drugs. 
         
         
        In relation to the second section 25(2) offence the amount of tablets supplied was 1002 containing 10.5 to 11 percent MDMA. 
         
         
        On the facts he was obviously dealing in drugs in a predetermined way for profit. It is noted that in relation to the offence of offer to supply there is less criminality than in actual supply although the penalty is the same for both. In this offence no drug was actually supplied. 
         
        
       
      
    19 Under a heading “Factors under s 21A” the Judge stated as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        I have already dealt with factors in mitigation including the prisoner’s plea and his rehabilitation prospects and his remorse. 
         
         
        In aggravation there was a level of planning in the offences on the part of the offender and the offender has a record involving drug offences. 
        
       
      
    20 This passage gives rise to two grounds of appeal, grounds four and five, asserting that the Judge erred in taking into account two aggravating factors under s 21A(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act being that there was “a level of planning in the offence”, s 21A(2)(n), and that the applicant had a criminal record, s 21A(2)(d). 
     
      
    21 The aggravating factor under s 21A(2)(n) is that “the offence was part of a planned or organised criminal activity”. The wording of this provision seems to me to convey more than simply that the offence was planned. The fact that there was a “level of planning in the offences” as found by the Judge does not necessarily give rise to the aggravating factor in s 21A(2)(n). In R v Wickham [2004] NSWCCA 193 the Court stressed the importance of making findings under s 21A in accordance with the words of the provision.  
     
      
    22 Had the only relevant factor been the existence of planning in the commission of the offence, there might have been a valid argument that planning was an inherent characteristic of every offence involving on-going or commercial drug trafficking: see Elyard v R [2006] NSWCCA 43. But it is not an inherent characteristic of supplying drugs that it is “part of a planned or organized criminal activity” in the sense that those words convey. For example, I do not believe those words apply to the normal street dealer who purchases drugs from various sources simply to obtain the wherewithal to purchase drugs for his own use. Therefore, in an appropriate case this aggravating factor can be taken into account when sentencing for drug trafficking offences. In this case it would have been open to the Judge to find that such a factor existed in respect of each of the offences because it was clear that the applicant was committing the crimes as part of a drug trafficking organisation capable of supplying large amounts of different types of drugs to order. 
     
      
    23 As to the relevance of the applicant’s criminal record, it was argued that it was not of such seriousness that it could give rise to the consideration discussed in R v McNaughton [2006] NSWCCA 242: that more emphasis should be placed on retribution, personal deterrence and the protection of the community. The Judge did not indicate how it was that the record amounted to an aggravating factor. But the applicant’s record, consisting as it did of offences of supplying drugs for which the applicant was granted a bond on one occasion and a suspended sentence on another, did indicate that personal deterrence was at least relevant to the sentencing of the applicant. This was not simply a case where the record denied him leniency and so it seems to me that the Judge was entitled to take it into account as an aggravating factor. 
     
      
    24 The principal submission argued orally before this Court was that the Judge had not provided for the operation of special circumstances even though he had made a finding that they existed. It may well be the case that, having made some sentences cumulative, the Judge overlooked the effect of accumulation on the proportion between the overall non-parole period and the overall term of the sentence. The non-parole period is 74 per cent of the overall term. The argument was that, having found special circumstances, the Judge should have varied the statutory proportion, and, as he did not do so, this Court should put that finding into effect even if it resulted in a reduction in the non-parole by as little as 5 per cent. 
     
      
    25 In Nguyen v R [2007] NSWCCA 14 this Court refused to interfere to reduce a non-parole period notwithstanding an apparent error by the Judge in accumulating sentences in order to produce a result whereby, for an overall sentence of 12 years, an overall non-parole period of 10 years was specified notwithstanding a finding of special circumstances. The Court came to the view that so serious were the offences committed by the applicant that no lesser sentence than a minimum period of custody of 10 years would be adequate to reflect the objective seriousness of the totality of the applicant’s offending and the other purposes of punishment. In order to give effect to the finding of special circumstances the Court would have been required to increase the parole period, a course it could not adopt on an offender’s appeal. 
     
      
    26 In my opinion the same situation pertains here. An overall total non-parole period of 7 years barely reflects the total criminality involved in the offences for which the Judge was sentencing the applicant particularly having regard to the need for both specific and general deterrence. The second offence under s 25A was a serious example of its type having regard to the amount of drugs involved. The on-going supply to the undercover officer was an aspect of a commercial business for the distribution of drugs into the community. The offer of a large commercial amount of drug was also serious notwithstanding that the supply did not take place for reasons apparently unconnected with the desire of the applicant to commit the offence. The supply of the commercial quantity of drugs involved twice the commercial quantity prescribed for ecstasy. 
     
      
    27 The applicant’s position in the organisation is evidenced by his ability to negotiate with the officer and to offer incentives and reductions to encourage the officer to deal with him. When problems occurred in the supply of the commercial quantity the applicant reduced the price of the drugs as compensation. It is clear that, despite the applicant’s mental disabilities, he was quite capable of carrying out his role in the business of supplying drugs. The psychiatrist’s view to the contrary was not borne out by the evidence. It may not have been the most sophisticated business but it was adequate to achieve its purpose. 
     
      
    28 With respect, some of the Judge’s reasoning in determining the sentences he imposed do not bear scrutiny and to that extent favoured the applicant. For example, having found that the s 25(2) offences were of mid range in seriousness, the applicable standard non-parole periods were reduced from 10 years to 4 years and from 15 years to 5 years respectively apparently only because of the pleas of guilty. The Judge failed to comply with s 54B(4) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act which states: 
     
      
       
        
         
        The court must make a record of its reasons for increasing or reducing the standard non-parole period. The court must identify in the record of its reasons each factor that it took into account. 
        
       
      
    29 Although the Judge warned himself against paying mere lip service to the appropriate standard non-parole periods, it is difficult to see how he did not do so having regard to the very significant disparity between the sentences imposed and the standard non-parole periods prescribed. The Judge quoted a passage from a decision of this Court emphasising the need to give reasons for departing from the standard non-parole period notwithstanding a plea of guilty, yet no reasons were given for the departure other than the discount resulting from the plea. The Judge also gave no reasons for his findings that the offences were in the mid-range of seriousness. However, I would express my view that the fact that the large commercial quantity of the drug was not actually supplied to anybody would indicate that in this case the offence fell below the mid-range of seriousness. 
     
      
    30 It should be apparent that I do not believe that the sentences imposed were manifestly excessive notwithstanding the applicant’s subjective circumstances as a result of his brain injury or otherwise. There was none of the sentencing considerations that can arise from an offender’s mental disabilities present to a significant degree: there was little reason to moderate the need for general deterrence in this case given the conduct was a continuing involvement in serious drug trafficking; the brain injury did not reduce the applicant’s moral culpability for his offending; and the evidence was that the applicant was adapting well to gaol life: cf R v Israil [2002] NSWCCA 255. Given the difficulties that the applicant had experienced in receiving counselling to address his drug problems while under the supervision of the probation and parole service, his rehabilitation was not a forgone conclusion. 
     
      
    31 Notwithstanding the apparent inconsistency in the finding of special circumstances, on the one hand, and the proportion between the overall non-parole period and the total sentence, on the other, in my view this Court should not interfere to reduce the non-parole period. 
     
      
    32 I propose that the application for leave to appeal be granted, but that the appeal be dismissed. 
     
      
    33 BUDDIN J: I agree with Howie J.

      2002/93 Regina v Nikytas Nicholas Petroulias (No. 8) 
       
       
       
      JUDGMENT (objection under s.138  
      Evidence Act 1995  
      to admissibility of evidence obtained pursuant to search warrants and telephone intercept warrant upon the ground that evidence was improperly obtained) 
       
      
    1 JOHNSON J: The Accused, Nikytas Nicholas Petroulias, objects to the tender of two classes of evidence upon the grounds that evidence was improperly obtained within the meaning of s.138 Evidence Act 1995. 
     
      
    2 The first class of evidence comprises six telephone conversations between the Accused and other persons between 3 September and 4 October 1999, all of which were recorded pursuant to warrant issued on 27 July 1999. I have already rejected a challenge to that warrant upon the basis that it is bad on its face: R v Petroulias (No. 5) [2006] NSWSC 1155. I have ruled that each of the six conversations are relevant and admissible and ought not be rejected under s.135(a) Evidence Act 1995: R v Petroulias (No. 7) [2007] NSWSC 16. The contents of each of the six conversations are set out in that judgment. 
     
      
    3 The second class of evidence comprises a range of documents and other material obtained as a result of execution of search warrants on 24 March 2000. Of particular significance to the Crown case is a range of documents and other materials obtained from a storage facility in Fitzroy, Melbourne, leased by the Accused in the name of Christopher Marriott (Exhibit VR7).  
     
      
       
      Application for Voir Dire 
       
      
    4 The Accused sought a voir dire with respect to this objection. The Crown did not contend that this was an inappropriate matter for a voir dire. Submissions were made with respect to the nature and form of evidence to be received on the voir dire, given that a voir dire had been conducted, in aid of a similar objection, before Sully J in March 2005 in advance of the first trial. The principal witness called on the voir dire before Sully J was Mr Michael O’Neill, an Assistant Commissioner of Taxation. Mr Sutherland SC, for the Accused, submitted that the appropriate course was for the Court to receive the transcript of Mr O’Neill’s earlier evidence and to allow further limited cross-examination of Mr O’Neill. I acceded to this application: R v Petroulias (No. 6) [2006] NSWSC 1422. 
     
      
    5 In addition to the evidence of Mr O’Neill on the voir dire before Sully J and again before me, additional evidence was adduced by the parties which bears upon the present objection. There is some overlap with evidence adduced with respect to a separate objection under s.138 Evidence Act 1995 to the admissibility of the whole of the evidence of a Crown witness, Richard Llewellyn Morgan. This objection is addressed in a separate judgment to be delivered today: R v Petroulias (No. 9) [2007] NSWSC 84. The scope of evidence to be adduced on the voir dire with respect to that objection was also considered in R v Petroulias (No. 6). 
     
      
       
      Ruling of Sully J on 29 March 2005 
       
      
    6 As mentioned earlier, the Accused made a similar objection under s.138 with respect to the admissibility of evidence obtained by execution of the warrants referred to. 
     
      
    7 I am not bound by the decision of 29 March 2005 of Sully J concerning this objection in advance of the first trial. In considering the objection, in due course, I will consider the evidence and submissions and make my own independent assessment for the purpose of ruling on the application. I will, however, have regard to the decisions of Sully J in my own process of decision making: R v Petroulias (No. 1) [2006] NSWSC 788 at [51]-[54].  
     
      
    8 There is a feature of the judgment of Sully J to which reference should be made. His Honour had the opportunity over three days, to observe Mr O’Neill giving evidence (PT509-665, 2005). A fundamental feature of the present objection is a challenge to the evidence of Mr O’Neill. As I observed in R v Petroulias (No. 6) at [5], Sully J made a credibility finding favourable to Mr O’Neill. 
     
      
    9 Mr O’Neill gave evidence before me on one day, 31 January 2007 (PT669- 730, 2007). I had an opportunity, albeit a more limited opportunity than Sully J, to observe Mr O’Neill giving evidence and to assess his demeanour. In approaching the submissions advanced by the parties on this application, I have regard to the fact that a senior and most experienced Judge of this Court observed Mr O’Neill giving evidence on similar issues on a prior occasion and reached a conclusion favourable to the witness, finding that his evidence “was credible” and “accorded with the objective probabilities”.  
     
      
    10 As observed, however, it remains for me to make my own independent assessment of the evidence, oral and documentary, for the purpose of ruling upon the present objection.

    11 Section 138 Evidence Act 1995 is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        Exclusion of improperly or illegally obtained evidence 
         
         
        (1) Evidence that was obtained: 
         
         
          
          (a) improperly or in contravention of an Australian law, or 
           
           
          (b) in consequence of an impropriety or of a contravention of an Australian law, 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          is not to be admitted unless the desirability of admitting the evidence outweighs the undesirability of admitting evidence that has been obtained in the way in which the evidence was obtained. 
          
         
         
        (2) Without limiting subsection (1), evidence of an admission that was made during or in consequence of questioning, and evidence obtained in consequence of the admission, is taken to have been obtained improperly if the person conducting the questioning: 
         
         
          
          (a) did, or omitted to do, an act in the course of the questioning even though he or she knew or ought reasonably to have known that the act or omission was likely to impair substantially the ability of the person being questioned to respond rationally to the questioning, or 
           
           
          (b) made a false statement in the course of the questioning even though he or she knew or ought reasonably to have known that the statement was false and that making the false statement was likely to cause the person who was being questioned to make an admission. 
          
         
         
        (3) Without limiting the matters that the court may take into account under subsection (1), it is to take into account: 
         
         
          
          (a) the probative value of the evidence, and 
           
           
          (b) the importance of the evidence in the proceeding, and 
           
           
          (c) the nature of the relevant offence, cause of action or defence and the nature of the subject-matter of the proceeding, and 
           
           
          (d) the gravity of the impropriety or contravention, and 
           
           
          (e) whether the impropriety or contravention was deliberate or reckless, and 
           
           
          (f) whether the impropriety or contravention was contrary to or inconsistent with a right of a person recognised by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and 
           
           
          (g) whether any other proceeding (whether or not in a court) has been or is likely to be taken in relation to the impropriety or contravention, and 
           
           
          (h) the difficulty (if any) of obtaining the evidence without impropriety or contravention of an Australian law.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    12 In the present objection, the Accused contends that evidence obtained under telephone intercept warrant or search warrant was obtained improperly or in consequence of an impropriety for the purposes of s.138(1)(a) or (b) of the Act. The Accused does not contend that evidence was illegally obtained for the purposes of that section. 
     
      
    13 It is clear that the Accused bears the onus of establishing impropriety on an objection under s.138: Robinson v Woolworths Limited (2005) 64 NSWLR 612 at 621 [33], 632 [106]. 
     
      
    14 Sections 141 and 142 Evidence Act 1995 provide as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “141  
        Criminal proceedings: standard of proof 
         
         
          
          (1) In a criminal proceeding, the court is not to find the case of the prosecution proved unless it is satisfied that it has been proved beyond reasonable doubt. 
           
           
          (2) In a criminal proceeding, the court is to find the case of a defendant proved if it is satisfied that the case has been proved on the balance of probabilities. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        142  
        Admissibility of evidence: standard of proof 
         
         
          
          (1) Except as otherwise provided by this Act, in any proceeding the court is to find that the facts necessary for deciding: 
          
         
         
          
           
            
            (a) a question whether evidence should be admitted or not admitted, whether in the exercise of a discretion or not, or 
             
             
            (b) any other question arising under this Act, 
            
           
          
         
         
          
           
            
            have been proved if it is satisfied that they have been proved on the balance of probabilities. 
            
           
          
         
         
          
          (2) In determining whether it is so satisfied, the matters that the court must take into account include: 
          
         
         
          
           
            
            (a) the importance of the evidence in the proceeding, and 
             
             
            (b) the gravity of the matters alleged in relation to the question.” 
            
           
          
         
        
       
      
    15 In R v Petroulias (No. 6), I noted at [21] that Sully J, in his judgment of 29 March 2005, approached the question of whether the Accused had discharged the onus upon him to establish relevant impropriety upon the basis that the seriousness of the matters alleged attracted application of the principles in Briginshaw v Briginshaw (1938) 60 CLR 336. Before Sully J, Mr Clelland SC accepted that the Briginshaw principle applied having regard to s.142 Evidence Act 1995 and the seriousness of the findings of intentional impropriety sought against Mr O’Neill (PT899-890, 2005). At one point in submissions before me, Mr Sutherland SC submitted that it was erroneous to import the Briginshaw principle to the application of an objection in a criminal trial to the admissibility of evidence under s.138 of the Act (PT840, 2007). Reliance was placed upon s.141 (reproduced above) in support of the submission that the Accused bears the onus on the balance of probabilities simpliciter.  
     
      
    16 Following an exchange between Mr Sutherland SC and myself, senior counsel for the Accused did not press this submission (PT841-842, 2007). Argument proceeded upon the basis that the Briginshaw principle did have application. In my view, this approach is correct. At common law, only two standards of proof exist - the ordinary civil standard of proof upon the balance of probabilities and the criminal standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt. However, the High Court in Briginshaw recognised that satisfaction as to the civil standard of proof does not involve a mechanical weighing of probabilities - satisfaction as to whether the civil onus had been discharged depended upon the gravity of the allegation and its consequences: B v Medical Superintendent of Macquarie Hospital (1987) 10 NSWLR 440 at 460-461 (per McHugh JA). The strength of the evidence necessary to establish a fact or facts on the balance of probabilities may vary according to the nature of what is sought be proved. Clear or cogent or strict proof is necessary where so serious a matter as fraud is to be found. These statements should be understood as reflecting a conventional perception that members of our society do not ordinarily engage in fraudulent or criminal conduct, and a judicial approach that a court should not lightly make a finding that, on the balance of probabilities, a person has been guilty of such conduct: Neat Holdings Pty Limited v Karajan Holdings Pty Limited (1992) 67 ALJR 170 at 170-171 (per Mason CJ, Brennan, Deane and Gaudron JJ).  
     
      
    17 Section 142(2) Evidence Act 1995 appears to import the Briginshaw principle in requiring a court, when considering whether it is satisfied on the balance of probabilities on a ruling concerning admissibility of evidence, to take into account the gravity of the matters alleged in relation to the question. It has been observed that s.140 Evidence Act 1995, including the reference to “the gravity of the matter alleged” in s.140(2)(c), is reflective of the law, including the Briginshaw principle, and provides for no new principle: Amalgamated Television Services Pty Ltd v Marsden [2002] NSWCA 419 at [61]; Palmer v Dorman [2005] NSWCA 361 at [40]-[47].  
     
      
    18 I am satisfied that the Briginshaw principle has application where objection is taken to the admissibility of evidence in a criminal proceeding under s.138 of the Act and it is contended that a person or persons have acted improperly or illegally. The need to take into account “the gravity of the matters alleged in relation to a question”  in s.142(2)(b) invokes the Briginshaw principle. This is especially so where the allegation is that a person has consciously and knowingly acted in an improper way involving, as is contended here by the Accused, the making of fraudulent statements and misrepresentations which found their way into applications for warrants.  
     
      
    19 The Evidence Act 1995 does not define the concept of “impropriety”. The principles collected in Ridgeway v The Queen (1995) 184 CLR 19 remain pertinent and those principles ought to be applied when considering whether conduct constitutes “impropriety” in a particular case: Robinson v Woolworths Limited at 618-619 [22]-[24], 622-623 [36]-[37], 631-632 [102. In Robinson v Woolworths Limited, Basten JA (Barr J agreeing) said at 618-619 [23]: 
     
      
       
        
        “It follows that the identification of impropriety requires attention to the following propositions. First, it is necessary to identify what, in a particular context, may be viewed as ‘the minimum standards which a society such as ours should expect and require of those entrusted with powers of law enforcement’. Secondly, the conduct in question must not merely blur or contravene those standards in some minor respect; it must be ‘quite inconsistent with’ or ‘clearly inconsistent with’ those standards. Thirdly, the concepts of ‘harassment’ and ‘manipulation’ suggest some level of encouragement, persuasion or importunity in relation to the commission of an offence: thus, in describing the first category of cases (at 39) the joint judgment in  
        Ridgeway 
         referred to offences being procured or induced.” 
        
       
      
    20 Basten JA (Barr J agreeing) made the following observations at 622-623 [36]-[37] concerning the minimum standards test: 
     
      
       
        
        “In circumstances where there is no unlawfulness on the part of any law enforcement officer, mere doubts about the desirability or appropriateness of particular conduct will not be sufficient to demonstrate impropriety.  
         
         
        Before leaving these broad principles, it is necessary to note the indeterminacy of the test identified by reference to inconsistency with ‘the minimum standards which a society such as ours should expect and require of those entrusted with powers of law enforcement’:  
        Ridgeway 
         at 36. Such a test invites assertion and counter-assertion, with no objective touchstone to assist in deciding which to accept and which to reject. It is at least doubtful whether a majority of the Australian community would have shared the High Court’s view of the ‘entrapment’ of Mr Ridgeway: see for example, the comments of McHugh J at 85. The answer is not necessarily to eschew the task, but to establish, in advance, standards of conduct against which a claim of impropriety can be assessed. Where no relevant pre-existing standard has been breached, it should be a rare case in which impropriety would lead to exclusion. (Of course, standards may themselves require scrutiny, but no relevant standard was identified in the present case.) And the test of such a case must involve judicial appraisal of all potentially relevant public policy considerations, being the task actually undertaken in  
        Ridgeway 
        . Appeals to ‘community standards’ will tend to substitute subjective reactions for careful analysis, albeit of ill-defined concepts.” 
        
       
      
    21 Hall J reached a similar conclusion in a separate judgment in Robinson v Woolworths Limited.  
     
      
    22 Both parties referred to the decision of Howie J in R v Cornwell (2003) 57 NSWLR 82 with respect to a s.138 objection alleging impropriety in the context of incorrect statements made in an application for a listening device warrant. Howie J said at 87-88 [20]-[21]: 
     
      
       
        
        “I am of the view that, otherwise than when subs 138(2) or s 139 apply, the court should determine whether the section is engaged having regard to the particular facts and circumstances before it but with due regard to the seriousness of a finding that evidence was obtained improperly or as a consequence of an impropriety and the outcome of such a finding. Not every defect, inadequacy, or failing in an investigation should result in a finding that the section applies merely because it may be considered that, as a result of those defects, inadequacies or failings, the investigation was not properly conducted or that the police did not act properly in a particular respect. On the other hand the terms of subs 138(3)(e), which subsection requires the court to take into account whether the ‘impropriety or contravention was deliberate or reckless’, make it clear that the conduct need not necessarily be wilful or committed in bad faith or as an abuse of power.  
         
         
        I am prepared to accept for present purposes that any misstatement of fact in an affidavit in support of a warrant for the use of a listening device on private premises may be an impropriety within s138, notwithstanding that the misstatement was not intended by the person preparing the affidavit to influence the officer who was to act upon that material in determining whether to issue the warrant. I accept the submission made by Mr Boulten that a person preparing an affidavit for the purposes of obtaining a warrant for the use of a listening device in a private home must be scrupulous to ensure that the contents of the affidavit fully and accurately set out the factual material relevant to the determination whether the warrant should be issued. The question of whether the misstatement was intentional, reckless, or inadvertent and the motive, if any, for the misstatement will be matters which are relevant to the gravity of the impropriety and the exercise of discretion to permit the Crown to lead the evidence notwithstanding that it was obtained improperly or as a consequence of an impropriety.” 
        
       
      
    23 In Director of Public Prosecutions v AM (2006) 161 A Crim R 219, Hall J at 228 [37]-[38], followed the decision of Howie J in R v Cornwell. Hall J said: 
     
      
       
        
        “In  
        Cornwell 
         (supra), Howie, J. made a number of observations on the operation of s.138(1) including the following:- 
         
         
        • The court in considering its provisions should determine whether the section is engaged, having regard to the particular facts and circumstances before it, but with due regard to the seriousness of a finding that evidence was obtained improperly or as a consequence of an impropriety, and the outcome of such a finding. 
         
         
        • Not every defect, inadequacy or failing in an investigation should result in a finding that the section applies merely because it may be considered that, as a result of those defects, inadequacies or failings, the investigation was not properly conducted or that the police did not act properly in a particular respect. 
         
         
        • On the other hand, the terms of s.138(3)(e), which subsection requires the court to take into account whether the ‘impropriety or contravention was deliberate or reckless’, make it clear that the conduct need not necessarily be wilful or committed in bad faith or as an abuse of power (at [20]). 
         
         
        The test for determining whether evidence has been ‘improperly’ obtained is, accordingly, not necessarily dependent upon establishing in every case a state of mind indicative of ‘intentional’ conduct or a consciousness of impropriety.” 
        
       
      
    24 An imperfection or defect in procedures utilised by law enforcement officers will not necessarily equate to impropriety within the meaning of s.138, nor will all inappropriate conduct of a law enforcement officer necessarily be improper within the meaning of that term in s.138(1)(a): Director of Public Prosecutions v AM at 230 [45]. 
     
      
    25 If impropriety is established by the Accused, it remains necessary, in the present context, for the Accused to establish that the impropriety resulted in the issuing of the relevant warrant or warrants and thus the obtaining of the telephone conversations or documentary and other material to which objection is taken. The Accused must satisfy the Court that there is causal connection between the impropriety and the obtaining of the impugned evidence: R v Dalley (2002) 132 A Crim R 169 at 186 [86]; R v Cornwell at 89 [25]. If the Court cannot be satisfied of that matter, s.138 has no application. A connection between the improper conduct and the obtaining of the evidence may be indirect. There could be a sufficient connection found between a misstatement in an application or affidavit in support of a warrant and the evidence obtained as a result of the issuing of the warrant so as to engage s.138(1) of the Act: R v Cornwell at 89 [25]. 
     
      
    26 In the event that the Accused establishes the elements of impropriety and causation for the purposes of s.138(1), the evidence is not to be admitted unless the Crown establishes, on the balance of probabilities, that the desirability of admitting the evidence outweighs the undesirability of admitting evidence that has been obtained in the way in which the evidence was obtained. In considering this question, the Court is to take into account the factors identified in s.138(3) of the Act. 
     
      
       
      Short Summary of Accused’s Contentions 
       
      
    27 Before moving to the facts, it is appropriate to state shortly the Accused’s contentions in support of this application. 
     
      
    28 Firstly, it is submitted that Mr Michael O’Neill, a solicitor and Assistant Commissioner of Taxation, was motivated by ill-feeling or animus towards the Accused in and after the time when Mr O’Neill became involved, in February 1999, in the investigation of the Accused. It was submitted that the evidence revealed that Mr O’Neill was motivated by an element of professional jealousy and a dislike of the Accused and, for these reasons, wished to do him harm.  
     
      
    29 Secondly, the Accused submits that Mr O’Neill provided to Australian Federal Police (“AFP”) investigators a picture concerning the tax consequences of the Accused’s alleged activities (“total tax wipe out”) and possible losses to the revenue, which were either knowingly false to Mr O’Neill at the time or, at least, were such that he could have had no honest belief in their genuineness at the time.  
     
      
    30 Thirdly, the Accused submits that this false and misleading information concerning tax consequences and possible loss to the revenue was relied upon by AFP officers in applications for telephone intercept warrants and search warrants, being incorporated in formal sworn affidavits for that purpose. 
     
      
    31 Fourthly, it is submitted that this allegedly false and misleading information was highly relevant to the question whether warrants, and in particular, telephone intercept warrants, would be issued by the relevant issuing authorities.  
     
      
    32 Fifthly, although the member of the AFP who swore the affidavit or made the application honestly believed that the information contained therein concerning tax consequences and possible loss of revenue was true and correct, that information was clearly wrong and Mr O’Neill knew that this false and misleading information would be used (or misused) in support of applications for warrants as part of the criminal investigation. 
     
      
    33 Sixthly, in acting in the manner alleged, Mr O’Neill acted improperly for the purposes of s.138. The Accused submits that this finding clearly arises if the Court accepts that Mr O’Neill was acting in a deliberately fraudulent fashion. Alternatively, the Accused submits that the Court should find that evidence was improperly obtained even if the finding does not extend to that height. The Accused submits that there was clearly incorrect and misleading information contained in warrant applications and that its origin was, at the least, reckless and was caught by s.138 of the Act. 
     
      
       
      Some Factual Matters 
       
      
    34 To place the present arguments in a factual context, it is necessary to provide a sketch of some factual matters. 
     
      
    35 An Australian Taxation Office (“ATO”) internal investigation into the Accused was commenced in late 1998 following complaints made by various tax consultants who claimed unfair and improper treatment in the hands of the Accused and the ATO. On 27 October 1998, Mr Stephen Brown, a senior investigator in the Fraud Prevention Control Unit of the ATO, was asked to assist Mr Gregory Farr, the First Assistant Commissioner in charge of Corporate Services, to investigate the complaints.  
     
      
    36 Mr O’Neill is a solicitor and a career public servant in the ATO, which he joined in about 1985 at the age of about 20. He became professionally acquainted with the Accused in about 1997 when the Accused was retained as an external consultant to the ATO. 
     
      
    37 On 18 February 1999, Mr O’Neill moved across to the Strategic Intelligence and Analysis (“SIA”) section after the Accused was moved sideways from that function (PT669-670, 2007). Mr O’Neill was asked to prepare a report for the Commissioner of Taxation concerning the state of affairs in the SIA, with particular reference to tax avoidance schemes known as Employee Benefit Arrangements (“EBAs”). On 18 March 1999, Mr O’Neill provided a two-page memorandum on that topic to Mr Carmody, the then Commissioner (Exhibit VR3). A number of documents were annexed to that memorandum, including some in which the Accused played a part in their creation. Mr O’Neill’s memorandum did not propose a particular course of action adverse to the Accused.  
     
      
    38 It is noteworthy from the running sheets of Mr Brown’s internal ATO investigation (Exhibit VR2, Tab 1) that the office of the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions (“DPP”) was being spoken to by ATO investigators well before Mr O’Neill became aware that an investigation was on foot (15, 22, 25 January 1999). A further meeting took place between Mr Brown and representatives of the DPP on 2 March 1999. 
     
      
    39 Mr Brown’s running sheets reveal that discussions took place between Mr Farr or Mr Brown and Mr O’Neill on 4 and 11 March 1999, during which matters concerning the Accused were discussed. 
     
      
    40 A note in Mr Brown’s running sheets records information provided by Mr O’Neill to Mr Brown on 18 March 1999, including the following: 
     
      
       
        
        “No record found in SIA or the ATO of Global Growth Mgt’s advanced opinion. Appears that text of applicants request has been used to frame the opinion. GGM’s scheme seems to be total tax wipe out. 
        
       
       
        
        O’Neill does not believe that all PBR’s and advanced opinions have been captured by his review team.” 
        
       
      
    41 On 23 March 1999, Mr Brown’s running sheets record information provided from Mr O’Neill concerning Global Growth Management Pty Limited and Ashley Cain. The running sheet includes the note “GGM still marketing scheme and putting through millions of dollars” and “TFN [tax file number] of GGM is shown as the TFN for Cain’s company on AO [Advance Opinion] application by Cain”. 
     
      
    42 On 23 March 1999, Messrs Farr and Brown, together with Mr Bowyer of the ATO, briefed AFP officers McDevitt and Forshaw.  
     
      
    43 On 29 March 1999, Mr Brown wrote a letter of referral to Federal Agent McDevitt concerning “suspected criminal behaviour within the Strategic Intelligence and Analysis (SIA) section of the ATO” (Exhibit VR2, Tab 4). The letter commenced in the following way: 
     
      
       
        
        “At the centre of the suspicions are two SIA staff in the Sydney tax office, Nick Petroulias and Emmanuel Aivaliotes. Petroulias is a First Assistant Commissioner who reports directly to the Commissioner of Taxation. He is also the Director of SIA. Aivaliotes is a Senior Officer Grade C. 
        
       
       
        
        For the past four months there has been an internal investigation into a range of allegations about Petroulias and SIA. This investigation has been the catalyst for uncovering the suspicions contained in this report.” 
        
       
      
    44 The report referred to suspected criminal behaviour and said “At present the estimated revenue loss from the aggressive tax schemes is in the vicinity of $155 million” (page 1). 
     
      
    45 The report stated that “the value to a promoter of obtaining a favourable tax ruling can be immense” and provided two examples in this respect (page 2). 
     
      
    46 Significantly for the purposes of the present application, Mr Brown stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “2. Total Tax Wipe-Out 
        
       
       
        
        Petroulias issued some rulings for schemes that were ‘total tax wipe-out’ arrangements, ie. clients who entered into the arrangements could avoid paying any tax on their income. 
        
       
       
        
        Providing a favourable ruling for a scheme which is a ‘total tax wipe-out’ arrangement is diametrically ‘at odds’ with the underlying principles of taxation legislation and administration in Australia.” 
        
       
      
    47 Under the heading “ATO Assistance to Police Investigation”, Mr Brown said (pages 4-5): 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        Resources 
        
       
       
        
        The ATO will provide whatever assistance and resources that the AFP requires for an investigation into the suspected criminal behaviour by Petroulias and Aivaliotes. 
        
       
       
        
        Taxation Information 
        
       
       
        
        The ATO would be referring this matter to the AFP for investigation, therefore the AFP would have access to the taxation records necessary for the conduct of the investigation. 
        
       
       
        
        Expert Evidence and Technical Assistance re: Taxation Law and Administration 
        
       
       
        
        Tax counsel are lawyers employed by the ATO who are experts in taxation law and administration. They will provide investigative assistance and expert evidence on taxation law and administration as it relates to the schemes and favourable tax rulings. 
        
       
       
        
        Tax counsel can provide information and expert evidence on the technical structures of the minimisation schemes and on the efficacy of the rulings issued by Petroulias and Aivaliotes. They can also provide evidence on the disregard of administrative procedures for the issue of PBR’s, advanced opinions and NFA letters.” 
        
       
      
    48 The formal referral to the AFP nominated four ATO contact officers (Mr Brown, Mr Farr, Mr Bowyer and Ms Bonthorne). Mr O’Neill was not nominated as a contact officer. 
     
      
    49 Mr O’Neill’s memorandum to the Commissioner of 18 March 1999 (together with annexures) accompanied the letter of referral to the AFP of 29 March 1999, together with a number of other documents. 
     
      
    50 It was Mr O’Neill’s evidence that he was unaware of the referral by Mr Brown to the AFP until after it had occurred. He said that he had played no part either in the instigation of the referral or in its terms (PT520, 2005).  
     
      
    51 On 23 April 1999, Federal Agents Wills, Wildman and Dametto met with Mr Brown concerning the investigation. Entries contained in the running sheets of Operation Focaccia (the AFP PROMIS case report) (Exhibit VR2, Tabs 2 and 9) were referred to in evidence and submissions. 
     
      
    52 On 28 April 1999, Mr O’Neill and Mr Cheetham from the ATO met with Federal Agents Wills, Wildman and others in the presence of Mr Brown. Recorded in the PROMIS running sheets is the following entry concerning that meeting (Exhibit VR2, Tab 2, page 8): 
     
      
       
        
        “MICHAEL O’NEILL stated that there would be no circumstances under which the ATO would issue a PBR which would result in a total tax wipe out for a company. It appears that PETROULIAS has in fact issued PBRs which result in a total tax wipe out. O’NEILL can state that he has looked for and can not find the suspicious PBR applications. He is able produce  
        [sic]  
        documents which appear to have been compiled using cut and paste actions, with the above mentioned typographical errors, incorrect or recurring TFNs which suggest that PETROULIAS may have generated the PBRs.” 
        
       
      
    53 On 5 May 1999, Mr O’Neill was asked for an assessment of the impact and financial loss to the Commonwealth (Exhibit VR2, Tab 2, page 14).  
     
      
    54 Between February and May 1999, Mr O’Neill retained his offices in the ATO Centrepoint building, but spent time, from time to time, at the AFP building in Goulburn Street, Sydney. From May 1999, Mr O’Neill, and other ATO personnel, were located full time in offices in the AFP Goulburn Street building with respect to an investigation apart from Operation Foccacia. From time to time, he was called upon by AFP investigators in relation to issues arising in the Operation Foccacia investigation of the Accused (PT691-692, 2007). 
     
      
    55 On 17 June 1999, the first search warrants were executed as part of the Operation Focaccia investigation. 
     
      
    56 On 15 July 1999, Mr O’Neill met with Federal Agent Wildman and provided him with the draft document entitled “Estimate of Revenue Associated With Arrangements Considered by Nick Petroulias”. The PROMIS running sheet entry for that meeting records the following (Exhibit VR2, Tab 2, pages 40-41): 
     
      
       
        
        “Between 4pm and 7pm Thursday 15 July 1999, F/A WILDMAN met with ATO First Assistant Commissioner O’NEILL at ERHQ. During that time his draft statement was continued with a view toward finalization. O’NEILL provided WILDMAN with a draft document entitled, ‘Estimate of revenue associated with arrangements considered by Nick PETROULIAS’. 
        
       
       
        
        A summary of that document is as follows: 
        
       
       
        
        In March 1999, the SIA advised the AFP that the total deductions was $500 million; 
        
       
       
        
        Those figures were based on data for 1998 and during 1999 there has been increased marketing of these schemes; accordingly the figures could be much higher; 
        
       
       
        
        Additionally, the promoters on which the figures were based are a subset of the total population;  
        
       
       
        
        Based on an analysis of known promoters and the media, a reasonable estimate involves up to $2.5 billion in deductions; 
        
       
       
        
        The revenue at risk is therefore harder to quantify, depending on the type of tax claimed on the schemes (ie: company @ 36% etc); 
        
       
       
        
        In relation to rulings issued to Strong, Morgan, X & McLaren it is estimated that the deductions claimed would be in the order of $50-$100 million, similarly the revenue at risk is harder to quantify, depending on the type of tax claimed on the schemes (possibly $15-$30 million); 
        
       
       
        
        If the X arrangement is included, the figures could be increased by $100 million and $30 million respectively. 
        
       
       
        
        In conclusion, the estimated loss of revenue to the Commonwealth, due to the mass marketing of ‘copy cat’ schemes of original PBRs and AOs, could be between $600 million and $800 million. The direct loss of revenue from the actual PBRs and AOs issued by Nick PETROULIAS themselves is however, far less. It is the view of investigators that, with the level of knowledge possessed by PETROULIAS, there can by  
        [sic]  
        little doubt that he would not have foreseen the consequences of his actions and the associated full potential loss of revenue due to the flow on effect.” 
        
       
      
    57 On 27 July 1999, Federal Agent Dametto swore an affidavit in support of an application for a warrant under the Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979 (Cth) (“TI Act”). On the same day, Dr Duncan Chappell issued a warrant to operate for a 90-day period (Exhibit VA1, Tab 3). As mentioned earlier, the six telephone conversations in September and October 1999, which are to be tendered by the Crown, were intercepted pursuant to this warrant. 
     
      
    58 The affidavit of Federal Agent Dametto included the following paragraphs: 
     
      
       
        
        “5. The information set out below has been obtained from my own enquiries and from enquiries made by other officers of the AFP and officers of the ATO. I believe that the information is true and correct. 
         
         
        6. The AFP is conducting an investigation into alleged offences by PETROULIAS and other divers persons whom it is believed are involved in a conspiracy to defraud the Commonwealth. This fraud is being accomplished by the provision to the promoters of certain tax minimisation schemes, favourable tax rulings or advance opinions, contrary to Section 86(2) (Conspiracy to Defraud the Commonwealth) of the Crimes Act 1914 and Section 29D (Defraud the Commonwealth) of the Crimes Act 1914. The alleged offences are class 2 offences for the purpose of the Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979, in that the alleged offences carry penalties up to twenty and ten years imprisonment respectively and the particular conduct constituting the offences involves serious loss to the revenue of the Commonwealth. 
         
         
        … 
         
         
        9. On 29 March 1999, the AFP received a referral from the ATO regarding the suspected criminal activities of an employee, PETROULIAS. In brief, the referral indicated that the officer was suspected of having provided promoters of certain tax minimisation schemes with favourable tax rulings in the form of Private Binding Rulings or Advance Opinions. These rulings and opinions would not normally have been issued by the ATO as they effectively resulted in total tax wipeouts for the schemes. It is alleged that PETROULIAS may have had improper relationships with the persons promoting these tax minimisation schemes.” 
        
       
      
    59 The affidavit, which extended over 23 pages, then proceeded to provide a detailed explanation of rulings, opinions and tax minimisations schemes, including non-complying superannuation schemes. The affidavit (paragraph 13ff) then moved to the deponent’s grounds for suspicion concerning alleged improper relationships between the Accused and a number of persons, including Mr Panos, Mr Strong, Mr McLaren and Mr Morgan. The affidavit then turned (paragraph 15ff) to investigations by the ATO. Federal Agent Dametto deposes to the following in his affidavit at paragraphs 15.11-15.12 (Exhibit VA1, Tab 3, page 16): 
     
      
       
        
        “Assistant Commissioner of Taxation, Michael O’NEILL, of the ATO, estimates that the amount of deductions claimed directly attributed to the PBRs and AOs issued to STRONG, MORGAN, CAIN and McLAREN is $100 million. The estimated loss of revenue to the Commonwealth associated with these deductions is harder to quantify, depending on the ultimate incidence of taxation and the applicable tax rate. However, the ATO conservatively estimates the loss to the Commonwealth to be between $15 million to $30 million in tax revenue. 
        
       
       
        
        Michael O’NEILL, further estimates, based on an analysis of known promoters of the tax minimisation schemes, the mass marketing involved of these schemes and the media, that a reasonable valuation of such schemes involves up to $2.5 billion in deductions. This equates to an estimated loss to the Commonwealth of between $600 million and $800 million in tax revenue.” 
        
       
      
    60 The warrant contained the following recitals: 
     
      
       
        
         “AND WHEREAS I, Duncan Chappell a nominated AAT member, (within the meaning of the Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979), am satisfied, on the basis of the information given to me under Part VI of the Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979 in connection with the application that: 
        
       
       
        
        (a) Division 3 of that Part has been complied with in relation to the application; 
         
         
        (b) there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that a particular person, namely Nick PETROULIAS, born 21 November 1967, of 18 Middleborough Road, Burwood, Victoria, is using, or is likely to use, the service: 
         
         
        (c) information that would be likely to be obtained by intercepting under a warrant communications made to or from the service would be likely to assist in connection with the investigation by the agency that applied for this warrant of the following class 2 offences, in which that person is involved, namely conspiracy to defraud the Commonwealth contrary to section 86(2) of the Crimes Act 1914 and defraud the Commonwealth contrary to section 29D of the Crimes Act 1914, and 
         
         
        (d) having regard to: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (i) how much the privacy of any person or persons would be likely to be interfered with by intercepting under a warrant communications made to or from that service; 
           
           
          (ii) the gravity of the conduct constituting the offences being investigated; 
           
           
          (iii) how much the information referred to in paragraph (c) would be likely to assist in connection with the investigation by that agency of the offences; 
           
           
          (iv) to what extent methods of investigating the offences that do not involve intercepting communications have been used by, or are available to, that agency; 
           
           
          (v) how much the use of such methods would be likely to assist in connection with the investigation by that agency of the offences; and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (vi) how much the use of such methods would be likely to prejudice the investigation by that agency of the offences, whether because of delay or for any other reason; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        and to no other matters; 
        
       
       
        
        I should issue a warrant authorising such communications to be intercepted.” 
        
       
      
    61 As at 27 July 1999, the TI Act permitted the issue of telephone intercept warrants with respect to “class 1 offences” and “class 2 offences”. Section 5(1) TI Act provided that the term “class 2 offence” had the meaning given by s.5D of the Act. Section 5D(1) and (2) provided as follows (emphasis added): 
     
      
       
        
        “5D  
        Class 2 offences 
         
         
        Class 2 offences 
         
         
          
          (1) This section sets out the offences that are  
          class 2 offences 
           for the purposes of this Act. 
          
         
         
        Serious offences etc.

            (a) it is an offence punishable by imprisonment for life or for a period, or maximum period, of at least 7 years; and 
            
           
          
         
         
          
           
            
            (b)  
            the particular conduct constituting the offence involved, involves or would involve, as the case requires

              (ii) serious personal injury or serious risk of serious personal injury; or

    62 The PROMIS running sheets note a further conversation between Mr O’Neill and Federal Agent Wills concerning the calculation of revenue at risk on 29 July 1999 (Exhibit VR2, Tab 2, page 44): 
     
      
       
        
        “About 1:45pm Thursday 29 July 1999, First Assistant Commissioner Michael O’NEILL telephoned F/A G WILLS. The calculation of the revenue at risk as a result of PETROULIAS’ activities was discussed. There has been further changes to the stated figures of lost revenue. FAC O’Neill advised Mr Gordon Williamson, AFP Director Intelligence and Operations of these changes. At 3:00pm, a copy of the document forwarded to Mr WILLIAMSON was received from which details some of the considerations involved in calculating the revenue at risk and the revised figures. In summary: 
        
       
       
        
        * The revenue at risk from all Employee Benefit Arrangements is estimated to be $1B; 
         
         
        * The revenue at risk from the rulings under investigation by Operation FOCCACIA is $30M-$70M; 
         
         
        * There appear to be many variables which could affect the calculation  
        [sic]  
        a correct figure.” 
        
       
      
    63 On 17 September 1999, an AFP/ATO meeting was held at the Eastern Region Headquarters of the AFP following the location of 44 extra rulings found on the LAN (Local Area Network) account for Mr Aivaliotes (Exhibit VR2, Tab 2, pages 58-59).  
     
      
    64 By affidavit sworn 8 October 1999, Federal Agent Dametto made application for a further warrant under the TI Act. Paragraph 8 of the affidavit again stated that “these rulings and letters would not normally have been issued by the ATO as they effectively resulted in total tax wipe outs for the schemes”. Paragraphs 73 and 74 were in similar terms to paragraphs 15.11 and 15.12 Federal Agent Dametto’s affidavit of 27 July 1999 (set out at paragraph 59 above). 
     
      
    65 On 8 October 1999, Mr Brian John McMahon, a member of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, issued a warrant under the TI Act to be in force for a period of 90 days (Exhibit VA1, Tab 4).  
     
      
    66 On 14 December 1999, Federal Agent Donaldson, in the presence of Federal Agents Wills and Wildman, swore in Mr O’Neill and ATO Senior Investigators Steele and Gray as special members of the AFP (Exhibit VR2, Tab 2, page 91). The purpose of this was to permit Mr O’Neill and other ATO personnel to become aware of investigatory steps taken under the TI Act and information which had become available by use of telephone intercepts (PT520, 2005). Mr O’Neill was not aware until this time in late 1999 that the AFP were intercepting the Accused’s telephone calls (PT521-522, 2005). 
     
      
    67 On 17 March 2000, AFP and ATO investigators became aware that the Accused utilised a storage unit at Fitzroy, Melbourne in the name of Christopher Marriott. The following entry appears in the PROMIS running sheets (Exhibit VR2, Tab 2, page 131): 
     
      
       
        
        “AT 0915 HRS FRIDAY 17/3/00, F/As BLOOMFIELD & BURNAGE OBSERVED NICK PETROULIAS DRIVE LIGHT GREY/BLUE BMW SEDAN, VIC. REGISTRATION NUMBER EZZ 006 INTO CITY SIDE SELF STORAGE, 200 ALEXANDRA PARADE FITZROY. F/A BURNAGE OBSERVED NICK PETROULIAS LEAVING THE FIRST FLOOR OF THE STORAGE SHEDS. 
        
       
       
        
        F/A BLOOMFIELD AND BURNAGE SPOKE TO THE MANAGER OF CITY SIDE SELF STORAGE. THE MANAGER ALLOWED F/A BLOOMFIELD TO EXAMINE THE STORAGE RECORDS FOR 1999 AND 2000. THESE RECORDS REVEALED THAT SELF STORAGE FACILITY NUMBER 254 IS CURRENTLY LEASED IN THE NAME OF CHRISTOPHER MARRIOTT, OF 4/18 ORMOND ROAD, ELWOOD. CHRISTOPHER MARRIOTT IS A FALSE NAME USED BY ANGELO PETROULIAS TO CLAIM CENTRELINK BENEFITS. THE STORAGE FACILITY WAS LEASED ON THE 18 APRIL 1999 AND IS PAID UNTIL 24 APRIL 2000. 
        
       
       
        
        THE STORAGE FACILITY IS ON THE SECOND FLOOR OF THE STORAGE SHED. IT IS SECURED BY A RED ROLLER DOOR AND IS PADLOCKED.” 
        
       
      
    68 On 23 March 2000, Federal Agent Duncan Tchakalian made application for search warrants to search various premises, including the storage unit leased by the Accused in the name of Christopher Marriott. The application was made pursuant to s.3E Crimes Act 1914 (Cth).  
     
      
    69 Paragraph 7 of the affidavit of Federal Agent Tchakalian was in the following terms (Exhibit VA1, Tab 5): 
     
      
       
        
        “On 29 March 1999, the Australian Federal Police (AFP) received a referral from the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) regarding the suspected criminal activities of two of its employees, Nick Petroulias and Emmanuel Aivaliotes. In brief, the referral indicated that the officers were suspected of having provided promoters of certain tax minimisation schemes with favourable tax rulings in the form of Advance Opinions and Private Binding Rulings or No Further Action Letters. These rulings and letters would not normally have been issued by the ATO as they effectively resulted in total tax wipeouts for the schemes. It is alleged that Petroulias and Aivaliotes may have had improper relationships with the persons promoting these tax minimisation schemes, acting corruptly and defrauded the Commonwealth by using their authority to issue Advance Opinion and Private Binding Rulings that imperilled the revenue of the Commonwealth.” 
        
       
      
    70 The affidavit of Federal Agent Tchakalian stated later at paragraphs 29 and 33: 
     
      
       
        
        “29. On 5 September 1997, and on 9 September 1997, Nick Panos from Coleman & Greig Solicitors submitted Advance Opinion requests on behalf of Productivity Incentive Australia. Productivity Incentive Australia is a company operated by Geoffrey Strong, with Panos being his advising solicitor. Those requests were forwarded to Australian Taxation Officers Lowman Chow and Michael Charles for an opinion on a  
        [sic]  
        Strong’s scheme named ‘Productivity Incentive Trust Plan’. The Scheme results in ‘total tax wipeouts’. That is the rulings support schemes that are non-complying with the law, where the investor incurs absolutely no tax liability. 
         
         
        … 
         
         
        33. On 25 November 1997 Nick Panos submitted an Advance Opinion Request on behalf of Morgan Human Resources. Morgan Human Resources being a company operated by Richard Morgan with Panos as his advising solicitor. The Advance Opinion request was forwarded to ATO Officer Jim Targett for opinion on a scheme also named ‘Productivity Incentive Trust Plan’. This Scheme it is asserted would result in a ‘total tax wipeout”. 
        
       
      
    71 The affidavit included the following at paragraphs 69 and 70: 
     
      
       
        
        “69. Assistant Commissioner of Taxation, Michael O’Neill, of the ATO, estimates that the amount claimed directly attributed to the Private Binding Rulings and Advanced Opinions issued is $300 million. The revenue imperilled to the Commonwealth associated with these deductions is harder to quantify, depending on the ultimate incidence of taxation and the applicable tax rate, but would approximate $100 million. 
         
         
        70. Michael O’Neill, further estimates, based on an analysis of known promoters of the tax minimisation schemes, the mass marketing involved of these schemes and the media, that a reasonable valuation of such schemes involves up to $2.5 billion in deductions. This equates to an estimated revenue imperilled between $600 million and $800 million in tax revenue.” 
        
       
      
    72 On 23 March 2000, warrants were issued under s.3E Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) (Exhibit VA1, Tab 5). The search warrants were executed on 24 March 2000 on a variety of sites in different places throughout Australia. 
     
      
    73 As mentioned earlier, execution of these search warrants, and in particular the search warrant executed on the Melbourne storage unit leased by the Accused in the name of Christopher Marriott, led to the discovery of a large number of documents which the Crown proposes to tender in the trial and which, the Crown submits, are powerful evidence implicating the Accused in the crimes alleged (Exhibit VR7). 
     
      
    74 Documents and other material obtained on execution of the search warrant at the Melbourne storage unit included a desktop computer, a laptop computer, ATO correspondence and letterheads and financial records (Exhibit VR2, Tab 2, page 132).  
     
      
    75 The Accused was arrested at Melbourne airport on 24 March 2000 and charged with conspiracy to defraud the Commonwealth contrary to s.86(1) Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) (Exhibit VR2, Tab 2, page 133). 
     
      
    76 On 24 March 2000, a search warrant was executed in Adelaide on premises associated with Mr Morgan. Federal Agents spoke to Mr Morgan on that day in a recorded conversation (part of Exhibit VR4). On 6 April 2000, Federal Agents Wills and Dametto spoke to Mr Morgan in Adelaide by way of an induced record of conversation (part of Exhibit VR4). The circumstances surrounding these conversations with Mr Morgan, and the objection taken by the Accused under s.138 Evidence Act 1995 with respect to the calling of any evidence from Mr Morgan, are the subject of my judgment R v Petroulias (No. 9) to be delivered today. 
     
      
    77 Mr Michael Robert Ingersoll of the ATO made a statement dated 20 December 2004 which contained a number of schedules and calculations (Exhibit VR2, Tab 7). Mr Ingersoll provided the following calculations and explanations for his calculations (paragraphs 5-13): 
     
      
       
        
         
        “5. I am currently employed as Technical Leader, ATO Promoter Taskforce. I provide tax technical leadership and direction to Taskforce officers on matters related to compliance activities undertaken by the Taskforce. I have been performing these duties for two years six months. 
        
       
       
        
        6. I have also maintained liaison with the SB Schemes Team of the ATO with regard to the investigation and treatment of Employee Benefit Arrangements. I have caused reports to be prepared on the status of taxpayers associated with EBAs and have accessed relevant information held by the ATO, including information contained on the Schemes Database (now called Aggressive Tax Planning Database). I have liaised with SB Schemes team for 5 years. 
        
       
       
        
        7. Since giving the statement dated 29 April 2004 I have further reviewed ATO records concerning the status of taxpayers associated with EBAs. Annexed and marked ‘C2’, ‘D2’ and ‘E2’ are revised copies of schedules which show an update on the status of taxpayers who relied on PBRs and AOs issued by Nick Petroulias. The revised schedules also list amendments to the previous schedules annexed to the statement dated 29 April 2004. In the 29 April 2004 statement the corresponding schedules were annexed and marked ‘C’, ‘D’ and ‘E’. I have updated and amended the schedules by cross checking the information with the ATO audit files. 
        
       
       
        
        8. The revised schedules contain an additional ‘Amendments’ column which is highlighted. This column explains any change in the deduction claimed amount or audit status in the schedules annexed to the statement dated 29 April 2004. 
         
         
        9. The schedule annexed to my current statement marked ‘C2’ refers to taxpayers who have received PBRs regarding Employee Benefit Trust (EBT) arrangements issued by Nick Petroulias. The total amount of deductions claimed is $15,527,585.00. 
         
         
        10. The schedule marked ‘D2’ lists the taxpayers who entered into EBT’s and lodged returns claiming deductions without having a PBR or AO and based on an AO or PBR issued by Nick Petroulias to other taxpayers or promoters. The total amount of deductions claimed is $17,398,277.00. 
         
         
        11. The schedule marked ‘E2’ lists the taxpayers who entered into Controlling Interest Superannuation arrangements and lodged returns claiming deductions without having a PBR or AO and based on an AO or PBR issued by Nick Petroulias to other taxpayers or promoters. The total amount of deductions claimed is $9,301,553.00. 
         
         
        12. The total amount of deductions claimed to date as a result of rulings issued by Nick Petroulias is $42,227,415.00. 
        
       
       
        
          
        Audit activity 
        
       
       
        
        13. The schedules and therefore the total amount of deductions claimed are based on the outcomes of audit activity conducted by the SB Schemes Team. This has required examination of the affairs of approximately 138 taxpayers, some of which are continuing.” 
        
       
       
      Allegations Made Against Mr O’Neill 
       
      
    78 In his judgment of 29 March 2005, Sully J extracted a portion of the cross-examination of Mr O’Neill by Mr Clelland SC, then senior counsel for the Accused (Judgment, pages 6-7). The proposition put to Mr O’Neill was that he provided false information to AFP investigators “knowing these matters I am going to put to you were untrue and knowing that that information would be, or would likely to be used, in the preparation of affidavits in support of applications for warrants” (PT649, 2005). Thereafter, Sully J identified some 16 allegations put to Mr O’Neill based on that foundational proposition during cross-examination (Judgment, pages 7-12). Mr Sutherland SC informed me that these allegations were relied upon in the present application (PT856, 2007). The 16 allegations , and Sully J’s note as to Mr O’Neill’s response, may be summarised in the following way: 
     
      
       
      (a) that Mr O’Neill had falsely represented to officers of the AFP that rulings given in respect of the Productivity Incentive Trust Plan entailed a  
      “total tax wipe out”  
      - Mr O’Neill denied the allegation;  
       
       
      (b) that Mr O’Neill had falsely represented that the rulings relating to the Productivity Incentive Trust Plan would not normally have been issued by the ATO because they entailed  
      “total tax wipe outs” -  
      after discussion with Sully J, Mr Clelland SC did not follow through with the proposition as put originally to Mr O’Neill; 
       
       
      (c) that Mr O’Neill had falsely represented that, as at July 1999, the Commonwealth had lost revenue in the order of $15 to $30 million, that loss being directly attributable to rulings and opinions issued to Messrs Strong, Morgan, Cain and McLaren - Mr O’Neill explained that he had told AFP investigators that a combination of rulings and arrangements had imperilled Commonwealth revenue in the stated estimated amount; 
       
       
      (d) that Mr O’Neill had falsely represented that, as at July 1999, rulings in relation to the Productivity Incentive Trust Plan had put the Commonwealth’s revenue at risk to the extent of an estimated $600-$800 million - Mr O’Neill denied the allegation; 
       
       
      (e) that Mr O’Neill had repeated, in about March 2000, that false estimate - Mr O’Neill denied the allegation; 
       
       
      (f) that Mr O’Neill had falsely represented, in about March 2000, that the revenue loss that was directly attributable to the Productivity Incentive Trust Plan was about $100 million - Mr O’Neill denied the allegation; 
       
       
      (g) that Mr O’Neill had falsely represented that the Accused would have foreseen the full potential loss to the revenue, being a loss quantified in the way suggested by the preceding propositions that had been put on that topic - Mr O’Neill denied the allegation;  
       
       
        
        Sully J interpolated at this point Mr O’Neill’s explanation given in evidence (PT657, 2005): 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ""The concept we were talking about was in the context of a defrauding. I was advised at some stage that there were two elements to a defrauding; an imperilment and a dishonesty certainly. So, the imperilment was the notion that we were discussing. We may have use words that were found loosely around that concept ...... I can't tell you exactly what words I used. I don't have any particular recollection, but I would have used synonyms for the word ‘imperilment' I suppose.""  
          
         
        
       
       
      (h) that Mr O’Neill had falsely represented that it was not, and never had been, part of the charter of the SIA section to issue private binding rulings - Mr O’Neill denied the allegation;  
       
       
      (i) that Mr O’Neill had falsely represented that a particular ruling, the Bonnell ruling, should not have been issued because the ruling was contrary to law - Mr O'Neill's response was that he had no direct recollection of his actual words, but that he assumed that he would have expressed himself to the effect that there was an ATO view about non-complying controlling interest superannuation arrangements; that the Bonnell ruling was the first ruling to deal with such arrangements; and that the ruling differed from the then ATO view. Mr O'Neill denied that such an expression of opinion was then known to him to be untrue; 
       
       
      (j) that Mr O’Neill had falsely represented that the Accused had issued Productivity Incentive Trust Plan rulings - Mr O’Neill denied the allegation and said that he always made it clear that the Accused caused such rulings to issue; 
       
       
      (k) that Mr O’Neill had falsely represented that an ATO officer, Mr Targett, had claimed that he had been improperly pressured by the Accused to issue a ruling that was contrary to law and a  
      “total tax wipe out”  
      - Mr O’Neill accepted the initial part of the allegation, had no recollection of the second, but was adamant that  
      “whatever I said to the AFP I believed to be true” 
       (PT659.28, 2005); 
       
       
      (l) that Mr O’Neill had deliberately refrained from telling AFP investigators that ATO Officers Chow, Charles and Targett had issued Productivity Incentive Trust Plan rulings in accordance with an established line of precedent in the ATO - Mr O’Neill denied the allegation, and explained that he would have explained his understanding to the AFP, that he was aware of divergent views in the ATO and that he was sure the AFP were aware of these matters (PT660, 2005); 
       
       
      (m) that Mr O’Neill had deliberately failed to tell AFP investigators that rulings given in respect of the Productivity Incentive Trust Plan entailed a continuing liability for payment of both income tax and capital gains tax on distributions from the trust - Mr O’Neill denied this allegation; 
       
       
      (n) that Mr O’Neill had deliberately failed to tell AFP investigators that the Bonnell ruling accorded with ATO precedents - Mr O’Neill denied this allegation and explained that he would not have done so because he did not believe the proposition to be correct (PT662-663, 2005); 
       
       
      (o) that Mr O’Neill had deliberately failed to tell AFP investigators that, in the wake of the Bonnell ruling, the ATO view had changed - Mr O’Neill denied the allegation - he accepted that the had not put the suggested proposition because he did not believe it was correct (PT663, 2005); 
       
       
      (p) that Mr O’Neill had deliberately failed to tell AFP investigators that any of the rulings that were under consideration provided protection only for the particular tax payer who was the subject of the ruling, and that the Commissioner of Taxation was not bound, as a matter of law, to apply the ruling to any other tax payer - Mr O’Neill denied this allegation. 
       
       
      Submissions for the Accused 
       
      
    79 The principal thrust of the Accused’s objection will be apparent from the preceding account of submissions made before Sully J. 
     
      
    80 Mr Sutherland SC relies upon the written submissions dated 8 March 2005 and supplementary submissions dated 17 March 2005 of Mr Clelland SC and Mr Livermore. In addition, Mr Sutherland SC provided a brief outline of supplementary submissions dated 7 February 2007, to which he spoke at the conclusion of the pre-trial hearing. 
     
      
    81 To determine the present application, it is not necessary to rehearse in detail submissions made for the Accused. A range of issues were touched upon in support of an argument that Mr O’Neill had engaged in intentional wrongdoing in the provision of false information to be relied upon in warrant applications, or, at least, that he furnished such information with no genuine belief in the truth of the information provided.  
     
      
    82 It was submitted that applications for warrants, as part of a criminal investigation, require the applicant to provide accurate information in good faith to the issuing authority. Although an application to set aside the warrants was not maintained as part of this application, reliance was placed upon decisions which have held that a warrant obtained by fraud or misrepresentation will be vitiated: Flanagan v Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police (1996) 60 FCR 149 at 203, 213-217. It was submitted that a warrant is not saved because fraud or misrepresentation has been perpetrated through an innocent and unsuspecting applicant: R v Turner (No. 14) [2001] TasSC 124 at [97]. Silence as to a material fact may also vitiate a warrant: Flanagan v Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police at 217. Mr Sutherland SC submits that these principles provide an important starting point, given the solemn responsibility reposed in an applicant for a warrant which will, if granted, in one respect or another, intrude upon the privacy of a citizen. 
     
      
    83 It was submitted that Mr O’Neill had provided information to AFP investigators which was then relied upon by Federal Agents Dametto and Tchakalian in support of their applications for telephone intercept and search warrants. It was submitted that Mr O’Neill could not have honestly believed, at the time he provided such information, that it was true.  
     
      
    84 Mr Sutherland SC sought to emphasise the manner in which the tax consequences and potential loss to the revenue were characterised in the warrant applications in 1999 and 2000, in contrast to the manner in which the deprivation question was left at the first trial, namely, that the Commissioner of Taxation has an arguable case to put that the rulings were wrong, and that the risk to the revenue was such that the Commonwealth was in fact deprived of something of value: R v Petroulias (2005) 62 NSWLR 663 at 667 [11]. 
     
      
    85 Mr Sutherland SC invited me to reach a different conclusion to that of Sully J with respect to the credibility and reliability of the evidence of Mr O’Neill. It was submitted that Mr O’Neill had intentionally understated the significance of his role in the investigation as a means of distancing himself from the information relied upon in the warrant applications with respect to tax consequences and potential loss to the revenue. It was submitted that an ATO officer of Mr O’Neill’s stature and position would not, and could not, have honestly believed that the contents of the affidavits in these respects were true and correct.  
     
      
    86 It was submitted that Mr O’Neill’s evidence was inconsistent with evidence of AFP investigators in significant respects. For example, Federal Agent Tchakalian believed that he had shown drafts of his search warrant affidavit to a number of persons, including Mr O’Neill, before swearing the affidavit on 23 March 2000 (PT863, 871, 872, 2005). Mr O’Neill said that he did not think he saw drafts, although he may have had discussions with the officers who drafted the search warrant application (PT522.14, 2005). 
     
      
    87 It was submitted that Mr O’Neill was not a credible or reliable witness and that his motive for giving false information to AFP investigators may flow from his alleged ill feeling towards the Accused. 
     
      
    88 Mr Sutherland SC submitted that impropriety had been established, together with a causal connection with the obtaining of impugned evidence. Accordingly, it was submitted that the Accused had discharged the onus on him under s.138. It was then submitted that consideration of relevant discretionary factors under s.138(3) ought lead to the rejection of the evidence. In particular, emphasis was placed upon the suggested gravity of the impropriety which was said to be deliberate or, at least, reckless: s.138(3)(d), (e) Evidence Act 1995. 
     
      
       
      Submissions of the Crown 
       
      
    89 The Crown submitted that Sully J had heard evidence from a wider range of witnesses than were called before me and had a greater opportunity to form a view of the witnesses, particularly Mr O’Neill. Sully J formed the view that the attack on Mr O’Neill was ill founded and did not identify any impropriety on his part. The Crown submits that this conclusion remains the case, in the light of the evidence repeated in the course of the present application, and that no basis has been established for me to reach a different view to that of Sully J. 
     
      
    90 The Crown observed that what is alleged is that Mr O’Neill has been involved in improper conduct in providing false or misleading information to the AFP investigators. The Crown acknowledged that a misstatement of fact in an application for a warrant may be improper for the purposes of s.138, even if the deponent did not intent to mislead: R v Cornwell at 87-88 [21]. Whether conduct is improper depends upon the facts and circumstances of the particular case. The Crown submits that the task of demonstrating that the conduct of the witness who provides information used in an application for a warrant is improper is more difficult, particularly if the person is not specifically aware that the information will be used for that purpose. The persons responsible for the misstatements are the deponents, but the Accused in this case makes no allegation of impropriety by them. 
     
      
       
       
      Revenue Figures 
       
      
    91 The Crown acknowledges Mr O’Neill’s concession that he may have provided to the AFP the amounts referred to in the warrant applications for estimated revenue loss. 
     
      
    92 The Crown acknowledges that, ultimately, the amounts referred to in the warrant applications may have been excessive. It was submitted, however, that this was undoubtedly due to the difficulties in formulating such estimates, particularly in the light of the lack of documentation concerning the number of rulings issued. The Crown pointed to Mr O’Neill’s evidence that ATO officers within the SIA section performed the calculations, and that Mr O’Neill did not contribute or add anything to the figures reached by these officers (PT672-673, 2007). Where the defence submission asserts the provision of false and misleading information concerning revenue estimates by Mr O’Neill to AFP investigators, the Crown submits that it is important to observe that the figures were not calculated by Mr O’Neill, but by other persons against whom no allegation of impropriety is made. 
     
      
    93 The Crown points to the PROMIS entry for 15 July 1999 (see paragraph 56 above) as indicating that the direct loss of revenue from the rulings issues by the Accused would be far less than the larger amounts being mentioned. The PROMIS entry for 29 July 1999 (see paragraph 62 above) gave a figure for revenue at risk from the rulings under investigation as $30-$70 million, but stated that this was subject to the proviso that there were many variables which could affect the calculation. The Crown submits that it has not been shown that the figures for direct loss from the rulings of the Accused were excessive as the statement of Mr Ingersoll shows that relevant deductions were as high as $42 million (see paragraph 77 above). 
     
      
    94 The Crown submits that there was no impropriety on the part of Mr O’Neill personally in having his team estimate revenue loss and then pass that information to the AFP. The Crown observes that the defence arguments constantly assert that figures were given for actual loss. However, the Crown submits that the word “actual” does not appear in any documents in evidence. The Accused’s submissions add a gloss to the information contained in the affidavits.  
     
      
    95 It was submitted for the Crown that the defence contention, which seeks to contrast the manner in which revenue at risk was dealt with in warrant applications with the way in which the Crown now puts its case, proceeds on a misunderstanding, namely, that it is no longer alleged that there was a substantial financial impact on the Commonwealth. The Crown submits that it has always been alleged, and is still alleged, that the Accused acted in a way which had a substantial financial impact on the Commonwealth. It is acknowledged that the Crown shies away from pointing to an actual loss, but that the same basis identified by Mr O’Neill when dealing with the AFP remains the premise upon which the case is being run by the Crown, that is, that the revenue at risk as a result of the rulings was substantial (PT874.43ff, 2007).  
     
      
    96 Even if the figures included in warrant applications were in the end excessive, the Crown submits that the revenue at risk was still substantial, and the character of the conduct of the Accused involved remained serious, and sufficiently grave to justify the issue of the search warrants and the telephone intercept warrants. In particular, The Crown contends that the requirement for a Class 2 offence, that the particular conduct constituting the offence involved serious fraud or serious loss to the revenue of the Commonwealth (s.5D(2)(b)(v), (vi) TI Act) was satisfied in this case, even if the estimated loss to the revenue expressed in the warrant applications was excessive. 
     
      
       
      Total Tax Wipe Out 
       
      
    97 The Crown submission commences by noting Mr O’Neill’s concession that he used the term “total tax wipe out” in the course of providing assistance to the AFP (PT526, 2005). Mr O’Neill explained that the term is appropriate to the non-complying controlling interest superannuation schemes for which favourable rulings were issued (PT526, 2005). The Crown submits that Mr O’Neill made this clear in cross-examination at the pre-trial hearing before Sully J on 9 March 2005 (PT526, 548, 561-562, 2005). The Crown submits that Mr O’Neill maintained this position in his evidence before me on 31 January 2007 (PT708-714, 2007). 
     
      
    98 The Crown submits that an examination of the contemporaneous documentation reveals that Mr O’Neill has been consistent and accurate in relation to the use of the term “total tax wipe out”. Reference was made to the referral from Mr Brown to the AFP of 29 March 1999 (see paragraphs 43 to 49 above) in which reference was made to “some rulings for schemes” that were “total tax wipe out” arrangements. This information appeared to relate back to Mr Brown’s running sheet entry for 18 March 1999 concerning information from Mr O’Neill about the Global Growth Management Pty Limited scheme which seemed to be a “total tax wipe out” (see paragraph 40 above). 
     
      
    99 The Crown pointed to the PROMIS entry for 28 April 1999 (see paragraph 52 above) which attributes information to Mr O’Neill to the effect that “it appears that Petroulias has in fact issued PBR’s which result in a total tax wipe out”. The Crown submits that this factually correct.  
     
      
    100 Accordingly, the Crown submits that there was no impropriety in the information conveyed by Mr O’Neill to the effect that some rulings resulted in a total tax wipe out. Global Growth Management Pty Limited was one of the beneficiaries of a ruling for a non-complying superannuation fund. The Crown observed that Mr O’Neill has not been challenged on his assertion that non-complying superannuation fund schemes produced a total tax wipe out. 
     
      
    101 Mr O’Neill stated in evidence that the phrase “total tax wipe out” could also apply to employee benefit trusts in their application, but not as ruled upon (PT714.6, 2007).  
     
      
    102 The Crown concedes that paragraph 9 of Federal Agent Dametto’s affidavit of 27 July 1999 (see paragraph 58 above) included some inaccurate information. It was submitted, however, that this seemed “to be due to laxity of the author in correctly absorbing what Mr O’Neill had been saying about his observations about total tax wipe out” (PT870.6, 2007). The Crown submits that the statement was correct in part, but seemed “too broad to be precisely correct” (PT871.3, 2007). 
     
      
    103 The Crown concedes that inaccuracies appeared in paragraphs 7 and 29 of the affidavit of 23 March 2000 in support of the search warrant (see paragraphs 69-70 above) with respect to the term “total tax wipe out”. It was Mr O’Neill’s evidence that the Productivity Incentive Trust Plan could result in a total tax wipe out if it was implemented other than in accordance with the arrangements. Insofar as these paragraphs of the affidavit suggest that the Productivity Incentive Trust Plan could give rise to a total tax wipe out if implemented in accordance with the arrangements, then that statement was inaccurate (PT871-872, 2007). The Crown concedes that “technically that statement is not accurate and should have been the subject of greater particularity in order to embrace the instructions of Mr O’Neill” (PT872.4, 2007). 
     
      
    104 In summary, the Crown submits that the term “total tax wipe out” was apt to some of the schemes which were the subject of rulings (the non-complying superannuation trust schemes) and could extend to employee benefit trust schemes if the scheme was not implemented in accordance with the arrangements. To the extent that the statements made in the warrant applications did not make this distinction clear, the applications contained inaccuracies.  
     
      
    105 However, the Crown submits that allowance ought be made for the fact that Federal Agents Dametto and Tchakalian were setting out in the affidavits their understanding of a complex legal and factual position. There had been, in effect, some breakdown in communication between Mr O’Neill and ATO officers, on the one hand, and the AFP deponents, on the other, in conveying a complete and accurate understanding of a complex concept based, as it was at the time, on a developing understanding of what had occurred.  
     
      
    106 The Crown submits that this does not constitute a foundation for a finding of impropriety on the part of Mr O’Neill in the manner alleged by the Accused. 
     
      
       
      Mala Fides 
       
      
    107 The Crown submits that there is no evidence of ill will on the part of Mr O’Neill towards the Accused. Mr O’Neill has denied on oath, on more than one occasion, that he had any animosity towards the Accused (PT511-512, 2005). 
     
      
    108 The Crown emphasised that the investigation into the conduct of the Accused by Mr Brown was well advanced before Mr O’Neill even met Mr Brown in February 1999. Mr Brown’s investigation had been on foot since October 1998. It was submitted that Mr O’Neill had no interest in taking over the position of the Accused as the officer in charge of the SIA. Mr O’Neill was a lawyer engaged in the Tax Counsel Network and did not stand to gain any increase in salary from a transfer to the SIA (PT516, 2005). 
     
      
    109 The Crown submits that the report written by Mr O’Neill for the Commissioner of Taxation on 18 March 1999 (see paragraph 37 above) cannot be construed as an effort to give momentum to the investigation into the Accused. Mr O’Neill compiled a two-page summary only, and the balance of the material was compiled by other officers in SIA, including the Accused. The Accused is not mentioned, directly or indirectly, in the summary prepared by Mr O’Neill or in any of the attachments (except as a participant in preparation of some of the documents). 
     
      
    110 It was submitted that Mr O’Neill played no part in the decision to refer the matter to the AFP, and was unaware that such a course had been followed until after the referral, a course which surprised him (PT519, 2005). Mr O’Neill played no part in preparing the referral letter sent by Mr Brown to the AFP on 29 March 1999. 
     
      
       
      Difficulty in Formulating Instructions 
       
      
    111 The Crown pointed to Mr O’Neill’s evidence that the task of establishing the state of affairs within the SIA was “quite complex” as the records were in disarray with documents missing from files. The problem was compounded by the fact that the rulings were not on the computer system (PT517, 2005). The investigation did not locate an additional 44 rulings on the LAN backup system of the ATO until 17 September 1999. The Crown submits that the location of a significant volume of original documentation relating to the applications for the rulings in the Melbourne storage unit leased by the Accused in the name of Christopher Marriott, further serves to explain the difficulties encountered in attempting to formulate a picture of what had been happening in the SIA. 
     
      
       
      Contribution of Mr O’Neill to Application for Warrants 
       
      
    112 The Crown points to Mr O’Neill’s evidence that he was unaware of the fact that telephone intercept warrants were being sought or utilised until he was sworn in as a special member of the AFP in December 1999 (PT520-522, 2005). The telephone intercepts which the Crown proposes to tender had already been recorded in September and October 1999 before Mr O’Neill even knew that a telephone intercept warrant was in place. The Crown submits that Mr O’Neill’s evidence ought be accepted and that he did not know, prior to December 1999, that affidavits were being prepared for telephone intercept warrants. 
     
      
    113 The Crown accepts that the AFP relied upon Mr O’Neill for technical assistance in relation to matters which were included in applications for warrants. However, the Crown submits that the Court should accept that Mr O’Neill had no direct involvement in settling the affidavits relied upon (PT522, 2005).  
     
      
       
      Causation 
       
      
    114 It was submitted for the Crown that, even if impropriety was established, the Court could not be satisfied that evidence was obtained in consequence of any impropriety for the purpose of s.138: R v Cornwell at 89 [25]. The Crown submits that the issue in this case is whether the warrants were issued as a consequence of information provided by Mr O’Neill. It is clear, the Crown submits, that the information he provided was distorted, in some respects, in its inclusion in the affidavits.  
     
      
    115 The Crown submits that the unchallenged information, otherwise available in the affidavits, justified the issue of the warrants. The Crown submits that what was said in the applications about “total tax wipe outs” was, in large part, correct for the reasons given by Mr O’Neill. It was submitted that a similar conclusion ought be reached with respect to the revenue figures. As Mr Ingersoll’s calculations demonstrate, a very substantial sum had been the subject of deductions ($42 million) and the revenue had been seriously placed at risk.  
     
      
    116 The Crown submits that the revenue at risk was, on any view, sufficient to render the conduct a serious fraud, or to constitute a serious loss to the revenue, and that it is beyond dispute that some rulings resulted in a total tax wipe out and were thus contrary to ATO policy. 
     
      
    117 Accordingly, the Crown submits that, even if impropriety had been established, the Accused has failed to establish the relevant causal link. 
     
      
       
      Discretionary Considerations 
       
      
    118 If the Crown submissions concerning impropriety and causation were rejected, the Crown submits that the Court should be satisfied, in the exercise of discretion, that the evidence obtained pursuant to the telephone intercept warrant and search warrants ought be admitted under s.138(1) and (3) Evidence Act 1995. 
     
      
       
      Determination  
       
       
      The Impropriety Issue 
       
      
    119 To constitute impropriety for the purpose of s.138(1), it is not necessary that a finding be made of deliberate or intentional wrongdoing. However, it is necessary to make findings with respect to the facts and circumstances of the present case to allow a conclusion to be reached as to whether impropriety is demonstrated in the sense recognised in Robinson v Woolworths Limited. 
     
      
    120 It is common ground that statements appeared in the affidavits sworn in support of the telephone intercept warrant application of 27 July 1999 and the search warrant application of 23 March 2000 which were factually inaccurate. Given the submissions made by the parties, it is necessary to consider how this came about.  
     
      
    121 Mr Sutherland SC’s first submission is that the Court should be satisfied that Mr O’Neill knowingly provided the AFP investigators with false and misleading information concerning the issues of total tax wipe out and the impact on the revenue of the Accused’s activities. It was submitted that the evidence calls for a finding that Mr O’Neill was affected by ill feeling and bad faith towards the Accused, so as to motivate him to provide knowingly false and misleading information to AFP investigators which he knew, at the time, would be used to the Accused’s detriment in support of the warrant applications.  
     
      
    122 I have carefully considered the evidence given before Sully J, and again before me, by Mr O’Neill and other witnesses called at the pre-trial hearings in 2005 and 2007, together with the substantial volume of contemporaneous documents comprising Mr Brown’s ATO running sheets and the AFP PROMIS running sheets of Operation Foccacia. I have considered the detailed submissions made in writing and orally on behalf of the Accused on this point.  
     
      
    123 I am not satisfied that Mr O’Neill was motivated by ill feeling or bad faith towards the Accused. In my opinion, tenuous submissions were made on behalf of the Accused, with respect to some actions of Mr O’Neill at various times, in an effort to attribute to him bad faith. In my view, the submissions fell very far short of demonstrating such a proposition.  
     
      
    124 The evidence points to Mr O’Neill providing assistance to Mr Brown’s ATO investigation, and then the AFP investigation, in a variety of ways which do not support a finding that he was motivated by ill will or animus towards the Accused. Accordingly, I reject the submission of the Accused to this effect. 
     
      
    125 What findings ought be made concerning information conveyed by Mr O’Neill to AFP investigators concerning the two topics which are presently significant, namely, total tax wipe out and impact on the revenue?  
     
      
    126 There is no dispute that Mr O’Neill and other ATO officers provided information to AFP investigators for the purpose of the investigation. This is entirely understandable given the elaborate and complex subject matter under investigation over an extended period of time. I accept the Crown submission that difficulties presented themselves in acquiring a full understanding of the scope and content of the activities of the Accused with respect to rulings and advance opinions. The state of documentation within the SIA contributed to this difficulty. This was not a case where all relevant documentation was immediately available to AFP investigators and ATO officers, including Mr O’Neill, so that a clear and complete understanding of the conduct under investigation could be acquired.127 In my view, it is appropriate to keep in mind that this investigation was far removed from a fraud investigation where the amounts defrauded, or the extent to which the revenue of the Commonwealth, was imperilled, may be clearly and obviously identified. During the course of submissions, I raised with Mr Sutherland SC a number of scenarios where inaccurate information may find itself into a warrant application, intentionally or inadvertently (PT836-839, 2007). In my view, the present case presented substantial challenges, at the investigation stage, for persons attempting to identify or calculate, with any precision, the tax consequences or the extent of imperilment of the revenue resulting from the activities under investigation. Action taken in the investigatory stage, including statements made on these issues in warrant applications, must be considered in light of this practical reality.  
     
      
    128 I accept the Crown submission on the total tax wipe out issue. The contemporaneous documents contained in the PROMIS running sheets provide support for Mr O’Neill’s evidence, given in 2005 and 2007, that the total tax wipe out concept had application to the non-complying controlling interest superannuation schemes including, significantly, that of Global Growth Management Pty Limited.  
     
      
    129 I accept the evidence of Mr O’Neill that he was unaware that telephone intercept warrants had been sought and obtained until December 1999, when he was appointed a special constable for the purpose of perusing material obtained pursuant to warrants. 130 It is clear that material included by Federal Agent Dametto in the telephone intercept warrant application of 27 July 1999 was based upon information provided by Mr O’Neill concerning total tax wipe out. I accept Mr O’Neill’s evidence that he did not read a draft of the affidavit or settle the parts of the affidavit touching upon this issue. He did not know at that time that a telephone intercept warrant was being sought. Federal Agent Dametto utilised information concerning total tax wipe out which was, in some respects, accurate and, in other respects, inaccurate. I am satisfied that this occurred as a result of an imperfect understanding of a difficult topic.  
     
      
    131 I am satisfied that the information inserted in the affidavit concerning total tax wipe out appeared inadvertently, and without any intention to mislead the issuing authority. I am satisfied that Mr O’Neill was not aware of the formula of words contained in that affidavit at the time when the application was made for the warrant. 
     
      
    132 With respect to the revenue calculations issue, the Crown concedes and I accept that the figures utilised were excessive. I accept the evidence of Mr O’Neill that these figures were calculated by ATO officers within the SIA and were not calculated or varied by him. I accept that Mr O’Neill was acting in good faith in providing these calculations, from time to time, to AFP investigators. It is clear, however, from Mr Ingersoll’s statement, that deductions in the order of $42 million had been claimed as a result of the Accused’s rulings, and that the revenue of the Commonwealth was imperilled to a significant extent. 
     
      
    133 I accept the Crown submission that the defence have overstated the revenue figures issue by contending that claims of actual loss were being asserted. A fair reading and understanding of what Mr O’Neill and others were saying to AFP investigators indicates attempted projections of levels of deduction, and qualified estimates of the extent to which the revenue may be imperilled. Once again, it is necessary to view these steps in the practical reality of a difficult and complex investigation where parts of the picture were only revealed over time. 
     
      
    134 The Accused points to the contrast between the extent to which the Commonwealth was said to be imperilled financially in the warrant applications and the manner in which the Crown puts its case now on the element of deprivation on the fraud count. Once again, it is appropriate to observe that complex issues of fact and law have been involved in this investigation and prosecution since 1999 and 2000, culminating in the approach taken by the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Petroulias (2005) 62 NSWLR 663 to this question. My judgment, R v Petroulias (No. 1) [2006] NSWSC 788, sets out the heavily litigated history of a number of issues in these proceedings, including imperilment of the Commonwealth’s revenue. 
     
      
    135 I accept Mr O’Neill’s evidence that he did not check Federal Agent Tchakalian’s draft application for search warrants dated 23 March 2000. Mr O’Neill acknowledges that he may have had discussions with the draftsman of the search warrant application (PT522, 2005). It is correct that the information contained in the affidavit emanated, in general terms, from Mr O’Neill. However, I accept that Mr O’Neill did not check and approve the precise wording used in Federal Agent Tchakalian’s affidavit. This conclusion does not involve a rejection of the evidence of Federal Agent Tchakalian. 
     
      
    136 In reaching these conclusions concerning the evidence of Mr O’Neill, I have had regard to the findings of Sully J concerning the demeanour and credibility of Mr O’Neill. I have formed my own view, as well, concerning these features of Mr O’Neill’s evidence, having observed him in the witness box. I agree with Sully J that Mr O’Neill’s evidence accords with the objective probabilities. This is a case where a favourable demeanour finding with respect to Mr O’Neill accords with other objective facts which fortify the conclusion reached: Goodrich Aerospace Pty Limited v Arsic [2006] NSWSC 187 at [28]ff. Like Sully J (Judgment, page 16), I am wholly unpersuaded that a body of evidence is present to support the strong findings of intentional impropriety sought by the Accused against Mr O’Neill. 
     
      
    137 In summary: 
     
      
       
      (a) I am not satisfied that Mr O’Neill was motivated by ill feeling or animus towards the Accused when providing information to AFP investigators concerning the total tax wipe out and revenue estimate issues; 
       
       
      (b) I am not satisfied that Mr O’Neill provided, or caused to be provided, to AFP investigators information concerning those two topics which was false or misleading to his knowledge; 
       
       
      (c) I accept that some information included concerning these two issues in warrant applications was inaccurate, in the respects acknowledged by the Crown; 
       
       
      (d) I accept that the inaccurate information concerning the total tax wipe out issue included in the warrant applications resulted from an imperfect understanding by AFP investigators of that which had been explained to them by Mr O’Neill - I accept that Mr O’Neill and AFP investigators were, at all times, acting in good faith in this respect; 
       
       
      (e) I accept that the excessive figures included on the revenue calculation issue in applications resulted from calculations made by ATO officers, other than Mr O’Neill, in good faith and were included by AFP investigators in relevant applications likewise in good faith - this issue must be viewed against the background of the difficult task which presented itself in attempting calculations of deductions, and possible imperilment to the revenue, in the context of an incomplete understanding of the factual position, and the complex issues of fact and law which required consideration for that purpose at the investigatory stage. 
       
      
    138 Accordingly, I reject the defence submission that intentional or deliberate impropriety has been established. I accept that inadvertent inclusion of information, some of which is factually incorrect, has occurred in the applications for warrants in this case. I am not satisfied that this occurred recklessly. The information was inserted in warrant applications in good faith, after consideration had been given to the difficult issues involved by ATO officers and AFP investigators, in the imperfect and incomplete circumstances then prevailing. 
     
      
    139 Is impropriety established for the purposes of s.138(1) arising from these findings? It is necessary to apply the test of impropriety referred to in Robinson v Woolworths Limited. It is to be expected that applicants for telephone intercept and search warrants ought be scrupulous to ensure that the contents of an affidavit in support of the application fully and accurately sets out the factual material relevant to the determination whether the warrant should be issued: R v Cornwell at 87-88 [21]. This is relevant to a determination of the minimum standards which our society expects of persons entrusted with powers of law enforcement: Robinson v Woolworths Limited at 618-629 [23]. 
     
      
    140 There is material contained in warrant applications in this case which is not fully accurate. However, I am not satisfied that the insertion of inaccurate information is the product of an intentional or reckless act on the part of Mr O’Neill or any ATO officer or AFP investigator. It was the consequence of a combination of factors, including inadvertence and an incomplete understanding on the part of the AFP applicants of some complex technical matters. In view of these findings, I am not satisfied that the conduct here was quite inconsistent with or clearly inconsistent with the relevant minimum standards: Robinson v Woolworths Limited at 618-619 [23]. Impropriety under s.138 is not established by pointing to the bare presence of some objectively inaccurate information in a warrant application. It is necessary to consider the circumstances under which the information came to appear in the application. 
     
      
    141 On all the evidence, I am not satisfied that the Accused has demonstrated that Mr O’Neill acted improperly with respect to the provision of information by him to AFP officers upon which reliance was placed in subsequent warrant applications. The test of impropriety, as explained in Robinson v Woolworths Limited, has not been established in this case. 
     
      
    142 Accordingly, I am not satisfied that the Accused has established the first and essential element of impropriety as part of the s.138 objection. 
     
      
       
      Causation 
       
      
    143 If I were wrong in my conclusion that inadvertent inclusion of some inaccurate information in warrant applications did not constitute impropriety in this case, I would, nevertheless, not have been persuaded that the relevant causal connection had been demonstrated between the impropriety and the obtaining of the impugned evidence: R v Cornwell at 89 [25]. 
     
      
    144 I accept the Crown submission that a substantial body of accurate information remained in the affidavits which was more than capable of supporting the issue of the relevant telephone intercept warrant and search warrants. I bear in mind that the statutory definition of a “class 2 offence” under s.5D TI Act required that the conduct constitute “serious fraud” or “serious loss to the revenue of the Commonwealth”. I am satisfied that the unchallenged portions of the affidavit of 27 July 1999 provided more than ample support for such a conclusion for the purpose of the issue of the telephone intercept warrant issued on that day. My observations concerning the term “serious fraud” in R v Petroulias (No. 5) [2006] NSWSC 1155 at [35]ff are apt.  
     
      
    145 Accordingly, had I found that impropriety was established, I would nevertheless have rejected the Accused’s submission upon the basis that the relevant causal nexus had not been established for the purpose of the s.138 objection. 
     
      
       
      Discretionary Considerations 
       
      
    146 In these circumstances, it is unnecessary that I proceed to consider the discretionary issue under s.138(1) by reference to the factors in s.138(3) of the Act. If that point had been reached, however, I would have admitted evidence obtained under the telephone intercept warrant and the search warrants in any event.  
     
      
    147 I am satisfied that evidence obtained pursuant to the execution of search warrants, including the warrant executed upon the Christopher Marriott storage unit in Melbourne, possesses a high probative value and is of considerable importance in the proceeding: s.138(3)(a), (b). The nature of the offences charged against the Accused are serious: s.138(3)(c). Important public interests are involved in these prosecutions, in which a claim of serious misconduct is made against a person holding a very senior rank within the ATO: R v Petroulias (No. 1) at [36]; R v Dalley at 171 [3], 189 [102]. If impropriety had been established, my findings disclose, at the highest, the inadvertent inclusion of some inaccurate information in the context of a complex, difficult and protracted investigation. In these circumstances, I would not find that the impropriety was grave: s.138(3)(d). On the findings which I have made, any impropriety was not deliberate or reckless, but flowed from inadvertence in the context of a difficult and, as I have said, protracted and complex investigation: s.138(3)(e).  
     
      
    148 In exercising discretion under s.138(1) by reference, inter alia, to factors enumerated in s.138(3), I would have been satisfied that the desirability of admitting the evidence outweighs the undesirability of admitting evidence that had been obtained in the way in which this evidence was obtained. 
     
      
    149 With respect to the six conversations recorded pursuant to the telephone intercept warrant, the probative value and importance of the evidence to the Crown case is somewhat less than the search warrant evidence: s.138(3)(a), (b). Nevertheless, the telephone intercept evidence is of probative value and of some importance in the proceedings. I would reach the same conclusions with respect to the factors set out in s.138(3)(c), (d) and (e) with respect to the telephone intercept evidence, as those expressed above concerning the search warrant evidence. 
     
      
    150 If the point had been reached on this application, I would have been satisfied that the desirability of admitting the telephone intercept evidence outweighs the undesirability of admitting evidence that has been obtained in the way in which the evidence was obtained and, accordingly, the evidence would have been admitted. 
     
      
       
      Conclusion 
       
      
    151 I refuse the application of the Accused under s.138 Evidence Act 1995 to exclude evidence obtained pursuant to telephone intercept warrant and search warrants.

      2002/93 Regina v Nikytas Nicholas Petroulias (No. 9) 
       
       
       
      JUDGMENT (objection under s.138  
      Evidence Act 1995  
      upon the ground that evidence to be given by Richard Llewellyn Morgan was improperly obtained) 
       
      
    1 JOHNSON J: The Accused, Nikytas Nicholas Petroulias, objects to the entirety of the evidence to be given by a Crown witness, Richard Llewellyn Morgan, upon the ground that his evidence was improperly obtained within the meaning of s.138 Evidence Act 1995. 
     
      
       
      Application for Voir Dire 
       
      
    2 The Accused sought a voir dire with respect to this objection. The Crown did not contend that this was an inappropriate matter for a voir dire. Submissions were made with respect to the nature and form of evidence to be received on the voir dire, given that a voir dire had been conducted, in aid of a similar objection, before Sully J in March 2005 in advance of the first trial. A number of witnesses were called on that voir dire in 2005 including Federal Agents Wills and Dametto and Mr Morgan himself. Mr Sutherland SC, for the Accused, submitted that the appropriate course was for the Court to receive the transcript of that earlier evidence and to allow further limited cross-examination of those witnesses. I acceded to this application: R v Petroulias (No. 6) [2006] NSWSC 1422. 
     
      
    3 In addition to the evidence of these witnesses on the voir dire before Sully J and again before me, further documentary evidence was adduced by the parties which bears upon the present objection. There is some overlap with evidence admitted with respect to a separate objection under s.138 Evidence Act 1995 to the admissibility of evidence obtained pursuant to listening device and search warrants. This objection is addressed in a separate judgment to be delivered today: R v Petroulias (No. 8) [2007] NSWSC 82. The scope of evidence to be adduced on the voir dire with respect to that objection was also considered in R v Petroulias (No. 6). 
     
      
       
      Ruling of Sully J on 29 March 2005 
       
      
    4 As mentioned earlier, the Accused made a similar objection under s.138 before Sully J with respect to the admissibility of the evidence of Mr Morgan. 
     
      
    5 I am not bound by the decision of Sully J concerning that objection in advance of the first trial. In determining the objection, I will consider the evidence and submissions and make my own independent assessment for the purpose of ruling on the application. I will, however, have regard to the decisions of Sully J in my own process of decision making: R v Petroulias (No. 1) [2006] NSWSC 788 at [51]-[54].  
     
      
       
      Section 138  
      Evidence Act 1995 
       
      
    6 Section 138 Evidence Act 1995 is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        Exclusion of improperly or illegally obtained evidence 
         
         
        (1) Evidence that was obtained: 
         
         
          
          (a) improperly or in contravention of an Australian law, or 
           
           
          (b) in consequence of an impropriety or of a contravention of an Australian law, 
          
         
         
          
          is not to be admitted unless the desirability of admitting the evidence outweighs the undesirability of admitting evidence that has been obtained in the way in which the evidence was obtained. 
          
         
         
        (2) Without limiting subsection (1), evidence of an admission that was made during or in consequence of questioning, and evidence obtained in consequence of the admission, is taken to have been obtained improperly if the person conducting the questioning: 
         
         
          
          (a) did, or omitted to do, an act in the course of the questioning even though he or she knew or ought reasonably to have known that the act or omission was likely to impair substantially the ability of the person being questioned to respond rationally to the questioning, or 
           
           
          (b) made a false statement in the course of the questioning even though he or she knew or ought reasonably to have known that the statement was false and that making the false statement was likely to cause the person who was being questioned to make an admission. 
          
         
         
        (3) Without limiting the matters that the court may take into account under subsection (1), it is to take into account: 
         
         
          
          (a) the probative value of the evidence, and 
           
           
          (b) the importance of the evidence in the proceeding, and 
           
           
          (c) the nature of the relevant offence, cause of action or defence and the nature of the subject-matter of the proceeding, and 
           
           
          (d) the gravity of the impropriety or contravention, and 
           
           
          (e) whether the impropriety or contravention was deliberate or reckless, and 
           
           
          (f) whether the impropriety or contravention was contrary to or inconsistent with a right of a person recognised by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and 
           
           
          (g) whether any other proceeding (whether or not in a court) has been or is likely to be taken in relation to the impropriety or contravention, and 
           
           
          (h) the difficulty (if any) of obtaining the evidence without impropriety or contravention of an Australian law.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    7 The present objection contends that evidence obtained from Mr Morgan was obtained improperly, or in consequence of an impropriety, for the purposes of s.138(1)(a) or (b) of the Act. The Accused does not contend that evidence was illegally obtained for the purpose of that section. 
     
      
    8 It is clear that the Accused bears the onus of establishing impropriety on an objection under s.138: Robinson v Woolworths Limited (2005) 64 NSWLR 612 at 621 [33], 632 [106]. 
     
      
    9 The Evidence Act 1995 does not define the concept of “impropriety”. The principles collected in Ridgeway v The Queen (1995) 184 CLR 19 remain pertinent and those principles ought to be applied when considering whether conduct constitutes “impropriety” in a particular case: Robinson v Woolworths Limited at 618-619 [22]-[24], 622-623 [36]-[37], 631-632 [102]. In Robinson v Woolworths Limited, Basten JA (Barr J agreeing) said at 618-619 [23]: 
     
      
       
        
        “It follows that the identification of impropriety requires attention to the following propositions. First, it is necessary to identify what, in a particular context, may be viewed as ‘the minimum standards which a society such as ours should expect and require of those entrusted with powers of law enforcement’. Secondly, the conduct in question must not merely blur or contravene those standards in some minor respect; it must be ‘quite inconsistent with’ or ‘clearly inconsistent with’ those standards. Thirdly, the concepts of ‘harassment’ and ‘manipulation’ suggest some level of encouragement, persuasion or importunity in relation to the commission of an offence: thus, in describing the first category of cases (at 39) the joint judgment in  
        Ridgeway 
         referred to offences being procured or induced.” 
        
       
      
    10 Basten JA (Barr J agreeing) made the following observations at 622-623 [36]-[37] concerning the minimum standards test: 
     
      
       
        
        “In circumstances where there is no unlawfulness on the part of any law enforcement officer, mere doubts about the desirability or appropriateness of particular conduct will not be sufficient to demonstrate impropriety.  
         
         
        Before leaving these broad principles, it is necessary to note the indeterminacy of the test identified by reference to inconsistency with ‘the minimum standards which a society such as ours should expect and require of those entrusted with powers of law enforcement’:  
        Ridgeway 
         at 36. Such a test invites assertion and counter-assertion, with no objective touchstone to assist in deciding which to accept and which to reject. It is at least doubtful whether a majority of the Australian community would have shared the High Court’s view of the ‘entrapment’ of Mr Ridgeway: see for example, the comments of McHugh J at 85. The answer is not necessarily to eschew the task, but to establish, in advance, standards of conduct against which a claim of impropriety can be assessed. Where no relevant pre-existing standard has been breached, it should be a rare case in which impropriety would lead to exclusion. (Of course, standards may themselves require scrutiny, but no relevant standard was identified in the present case.) And the test of such a case must involve judicial appraisal of all potentially relevant public policy considerations, being the task actually undertaken in  
        Ridgeway 
        . Appeals to ‘community standards’ will tend to substitute subjective reactions for careful analysis, albeit of ill-defined concepts.” 
        
       
      
    11 Hall J reached a similar conclusion in a separate judgment in Robinson v Woolworths Limited.  
     
      
    12 As will be seen, the Accused contends that Australian Federal Police (“AFP”) investigators acted in a deliberately and intentional improper fashion in this case. The s.138 objection is not based upon a claim of technical or inadvertent impropriety. In these circumstances, I approach the question of onus and standard of proof in the manner identified in R v Petroulias (No. 8) at [14] to [18].13 The Accused contends that the evidence of a witness may be excluded under s.138 where there has been improper conduct by police officers in a course of conduct leading to a suspect providing an induced interview, as part of an application for an undertaking under s.9 Director of Public Prosecutions Act 1983 (Cth). Reliance is placed upon the decision of Ireland J in Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v Ho (1998) 102 A Crim R 37 at 42-43 where evidence of a witness was excluded under s.138 as being improperly obtained where the Crown proposed to call the witness at the trial of a third person where the witness had agreed to give evidence against two other accused persons only, and not the third. The Accused submits that AFP investigators acted improperly with respect to Mr Morgan so that s.138 is engaged leading to the exclusion of his evidence. 
     
      
    14 The present application does not seek the exclusion of the evidence of Mr Morgan upon the basis that I should conclude that his evidence is unreliable. The difficulties confronting such an application have been recognised: Rozenes v Beljajev [1995] 1 VR 53; Rozenes v His Honour Judge Kelly [1996] 1 VR 320. The weight to be given to Mr Morgan’s evidence is a matter for a jury. However, as I have said, such an application is not made in the present case.  
     
      
       
      Factual Background to the Present Application 
       
      
    15 Although further oral evidence was adduced from Federal Agents Wills and Dametto and Mr Morgan on the voir dire before me, Mr Sutherland SC was content to rely upon written submissions of Mr Clelland SC and Mr Livermore, who appeared for the Accused before Sully J in February and March 2005, in support of the present application. No additional oral submissions were made. 
     
      
    16 In these circumstances, I will set out part of the judgment of Sully J given on 29 March 2005 in which his Honour identified the argument advanced for the Accused, relevant factual matters and recorded certain findings. His Honour said (pages 1-7): 
     
      
       
        
        “The nature of the alleged impropriety is that from first to last the relevant AFP officers carried out a pre-planned ruse, the design of which was in part to intimidate, and in part to induce by favourable and favoured treatment, the co-operation of Mr Morgan in the obtaining from him of evidence incriminating the present applicant in the offences for which he will presently stand trial in this Court. 
         
         
        It is convenient to commence the relevant narrative by canvassing some events of 24 March 2000. 
         
         
        On that day, three AFP agents attended premises at 91 Anglesey Avenue, Saint George, in South Australia. One of them was Agent Stephen Dametto, who had earlier travelled to South Australia from Sydney. He was armed with a search warrant that had been issued, pursuant to s 3E of the Commonwealth Crimes Act 1914, on 23 March 2000 in Sydney. 
        
       
       
        
        The warrant authorised the searching of the premises at 127 Kensington Road, Norwood, South Australia, which premises were described as the residence of Mr Morgan, although the premises were the residence of his parents with whom, as I infer, he stayed from time to time. 
        
       
       
        
        What actually transpired at Anglesey Road, and later Kensington Road, was tape recorded as it took place. The transcript of what was thus recorded is behind Tab 2 in exhibit D1 on the present application  
        [part of Exhibit VR4 on the 2007 application] 
        . 
         
         
        Mr Dametto and his colleagues identified themselves to Mr Morgan, and he invited them inside. Mr Dametto then explained to Mr Morgan why the police were calling upon him. He did so in these terms: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘We are here in regards to the allegation that yourself with Nick Petroulias and others were involved in the fraudulent issuance of taxation documents being advanced opinions and private binding rulings, and which led to loss of revenue to the Commonwealth government, and therefore against section twenty-nine (d) which is to defraud the Commonwealth.’ 
          
         
          
         
        Mr Morgan was asked whether he understood the allegation, and he replied that he did. Mr Dametto thereupon told Mr Morgan he and his colleagues were there ‘namely, 
        [sic] 
         but I should think mainly, to hear what you have to say’. He told Mr Morgan that the applicant and ‘other promoters’ were being interviewed in either Sydney or Melbourne. 
        
       
       
        
        At Mr Morgan's request, Mr Dametto repeated in broad outline the allegations against Mr Morgan. Mr Dametto then formally cautioned Mr Morgan, and also advised him of his right to have the assistance of a lawyer. 
         
         
        In my view, a fair reading of the transcript to this point does not suggest that Mr Morgan was being overborne, or that he himself thought otherwise. Plainly, he understood what had been put to him, because he responded by saying that although he had nothing to hide, he was in unfamiliar territory, and felt that it would be prudent to obtain legal advice. He proceeded to arrange an appointment to do so; and the upshot was that he took no further part in any formal interview pending his receipt of that advice. 
         
         
        The search warrant was formally read to Mr Morgan. He was given a copy of it; and in due course he went with the police to the Kensington Avenue premises, where the search warrant was duly executed. 
         
         
        As seems to be inevitable with tape recorded encounters of the kind described, the transcript itself is less than ideal, in that it records people talking at and over, as well as to, each other or one another. It is, even so, possible to get from the transcript a reasonably reliable picture of how things actually fell out as the encounter progressed. 
         
         
        That picture does not seem to me to be one of police intimidation or trickery, either deliberate or inadvertent. Nor does it seem to me to be a picture of a citizen so completely off-balance as to be incapable of understanding what was being put to him; or the gravity of the stated allegations; or the need to proceed with prudence and with the assistance of appropriate professional advice and assistance. 
         
         
        In due course, and on 6 April 2000, Mr Dametto in company with Mr Wills, an AFP colleague, formally interviewed Mr Morgan. The interview was tape recorded, it being necessary to change the tape from time to time. That entailed that the interview comprised a number of discrete segments as follows: 2.25 pm to 3.07 pm; 3.20 pm to 4.01 pm; 4.10 pm to 4.52 pm; and 5 pm to 5.37 pm. Transcripts of all four segments appear at Tab 3 of exhibit D1  
        [part of Exhibit VR4 on the 2007 application] 
        . 
         
         
        Each segment began with a reading on to the record by Mr Morgan of a written formula given to him for that purpose by the police, and reading: 
         
         
          
          ‘I am making this statement as a consequence of an assurance given to me by F/A Stephen Dametto that the contents of this statement and the information which results from it will be used to form the basis of an application for indemnity from prosecution to the Director of Public Prosecutions for the Commonwealth of Australia. I understand that as a consequence of this assurance, this statement cannot be used to prosecute me for any offence except an offence arising from any falsity in the making of this statement. If I am granted an indemnity from prosecution, I am prepared to give evidence as a witness for the Director of Public Prosecutions for the Commonwealth of Australia against any person as required. This statement made by me accurately sets out the evidence which I will be prepared if necessary to give in full as a witness. The statement is true to the best of my knowledge and belief and I make it knowing that if it is tendered in evidence I shall be liable for prosecution if I have wilfully stated in it anything which I know to be false or do not believe to be true.’ 
          
         
         
        A reading of the transcripts indicates the following things: 
         
         
        1. That at some time prior to 6 April 2000 there had been some consideration given by the police, by Mr Morgan and his advisers, or by all of them, to the possibility of an ‘indemnity from prosecution’ being sought from the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions. 
         
         
        2. That the focus of the interview was very much upon the present applicant rather than upon the person who was actually being interviewed in the wake of conversation during which he had been told that he was the subject of allegations of having committed serious criminal offences. 
         
         
        3. That the method employed by the interviewing police displayed a regrettable predilection for asking leading questions; and a no less regrettable willingness to carry on the interviewing of Mr Morgan during the tape-change breaks. I observe, but not in a merely captious way, that had those blemishes not been present, a deal of the time spent on the present application could have been saved by a reduction in the number of points available to be made upon the basis of the transcripts. 
         
         
        4. There is nothing to suggest that Mr Morgan did not understand what he was being asked; or what he was saying; or that he saw himself as being brow-beaten by his interviewers. 
         
         
        Following the interview of 6 April, the police set about preparing a witness statement in the conventional form. After several drafts had been prepared and corrected, a final statement dated 29 April 2000 was settled and Mr Morgan signed it. This is the statement upon the basis of which the Crown proposes, as I understand the fact, to lead Mr Morgan's evidence at trial.” 
         
        
       
      
    17 The Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions, by a document dated 22 August 2001, has given Mr Morgan an undertaking in these terms (Exhibit VR2, Tab 8):

    18 Although the term “indemnity” was used, at times, in evidence and submissions, to describe the instrument issued by the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions on 22 August 2001 with respect to Mr Morgan, the document is in fact an undertaking pursuant to s.9(6) Director of Public Prosecutions Act 1983 (Cth). The document is a “use derivative use” undertaking (under s.9(6)) and not an undertaking not to prosecute which operates as a transactional indemnity (s.9(6D)): Ganin v NSW Crime Commission (1993) 32 NSWLR 423 at 433; Registrar, Court of Appeal v Craven (1994) 77 A Crim R 410 at 430; Rogan v Hyde (1995) 84 A Crim R 519 at 524.  
     
      
       
      Submissions of Accused Concerning Suggested Evidence of Impropriety 
       
      
    19 It was submitted for the Accused that Mr Morgan was included in the search warrant of 24 March 2000 with the intention that this could be used to place pressure on him and other potential witnesses who were obviously not the principal suspects. Investigators had identified Mr Morgan because of matters personal to him and because of information they had obtained about him as a person who may co-operate and become a witness. 
     
      
    20 It was submitted that Mr Morgan was a susceptible witness and that it was intended to treat Mr Morgan as a suspect in the hope that this pressure would result in him deciding or agreeing to be a witness. 
     
      
    21 It was submitted for the Accused that AFP investigators put into effect a plan on 24 March 2000 to execute a warrant, but not to arrest Mr Morgan. Nevertheless, it was submitted that the police used language of arrest and charge in circumstances where there was no such intention. The police emphasised the seriousness of the allegations and then conveyed to the witness that what they were really seeking was his assistance in his investigations. 
     
      
    22 The Accused submits that, by 6 April 2000, no fact had come to light which would have justified Mr Morgan being regarded no longer as a suspect, but as a witness. By then, negotiations between the police and Mr Morgan’s solicitor had taken place for him to become a witness. Part of those negotiations involved the making of an induced statement which would be purportedly used in an application for an indemnity. 
     
      
    23 It was submitted for the Accused that the conduct of the 6 April 2000 interview with Mr Morgan involved the following: 
     
      
       
      (a) a document used by Mr Morgan and referred to in the transcript (Exhibit VR4, Tape 1, page 1) was later destroyed; 
       
       
      (b) there are references in the transcript to previous discussions of tape; 
       
       
      (c) the interview contained leading questions asked by AFP investigators which, the Accused contends, were of an improper kind, particularly for a witness who was apparently seeking an indemnity; 
       
       
      (d) conversations took place between the four tapes, which should not have occurred. 
       
      
    24 A principal submission for the Accused was that, during the break between the second and third tapes, conversation took place in which Mr Morgan recalled for the first time that he made payments to the Accused (Exhibit VR4, Tape 3, pages 1-2).  
     
      
    25 It was submitted for the Accused that an unsatisfactory process occurred thereafter whereby Mr Morgan’s statement was prepared and settled.  
     
      
    26 The submissions of the Accused concluded with the contention that the handling and treatment of Mr Morgan by AFP investigators was “an orchestrated ruse from start to finish”. 
     
      
       
      Submissions of the Crown 
       
       
      Decision to Roll Over Morgan 
       
      
    27 The Crown submits that it is a common and accepted practice in prosecutions to decide to utilise a suspect as a witness, the so-called roll-over witness. The prospect of recruiting Mr Morgan had been recognised reasonably early in the investigation. At a meeting on 28 September 1999, as a result of intercepted telephone conversations, it was then decided that investigators would approach Mr Morgan for information (Exhibit VR2, Tab 2, pages 60-62). 
     
      
    28 It was clear by then, the Crown submits, that Mr Morgan was involved in the marketing of the schemes and, in particular, his company, Morgan HR Pty Limited, was one of the initial applicants for an advanced opinion and one of the last to get a public binding ruling. 
     
      
    29 The Crown submits that there was no impropriety involved in the decision to approach Mr Morgan to give evidence for the prosecution. 
     
      
       
      Independent Legal Advice 
       
      
    30 The Crown submits that, whatever might be said about the conversation between Federal Agent Dametto and Mr Morgan on 24 March 2000, the outcome was that Mr Morgan not only had the opportunity to consult with his solicitor during the meeting, but also was left to obtain advice before making any decision as to whether he would co-operate with the investigators.  
     
      
    31 The Crown submits that any suggestion to Mr Morgan that he may have been involved in a serious offence was correct. The documentation revealed Mr Morgan’s role with the promoters’ entities. In addition, telephone intercepts revealed his association with the Accused including payments of money. By the time the search of Mr Morgan’s premises had concluded, the Crown submits that further significant evidence had been obtained in the form of the client lists which, by their appearance, had clearly been improperly obtained from the Australian Taxation Office (“ATO”). 
     
      
    32 Although Mr Morgan may have considered that he was not doing anything illegal (PT784, 788, 2007), the Crown submits that it was the fact that he had been paying amounts of cash to an ATO officer who was supplying rulings and ATO documents to assist in selling schemes from which the officer was obtaining a share of the profits. Accordingly, any impression conveyed to Mr Morgan by AFP investigators that he was involved in a serious offence was correct. 
     
      
    33 The Crown emphasises that, at the conclusion of the discussions on 24 March 2000, Mr Morgan was left to obtain legal advice from his solicitor. Before the commencement of the interview on 6 April 2000, the solicitor had an opportunity to discuss the matter with the AFP investigators and to advise Mr Morgan.  
     
      
    34 Accordingly, the Crown submits Mr Morgan’s decision to co-operate was reached of his own free will and was not the product of improper pressure by investigators. 
     
      
       
      Recording of Conversation 
       
      
    35 The Crown submitted that the procedure of tape recording the conversation with Mr Morgan on 6 April 2000, for the purpose of having a record of his version of events from which to distil a statement, was proper. It was submitted that, in the vast majority of cases, police simply prepare an electronic version of a statement with no record of the initial account given by the witness. The Crown submits that, to the credit of Federal Agents Dametto and Wills, not only was the conversation recorded, but the tapes were also retained. 
     
      
       
      Methodology of Interview 
       
      
    36 The Crown submits that there was no impropriety in the method adopted to obtain from Mr Morgan his account of his dealings with the Accused. Most questions were relatively short and were followed by a lengthy answer by Mr Morgan in his own terms. The Crown submits that, on very rare occasions, Federal Agent Wills intervened to focus on a matter already mentioned in order to clarify the position. 
     
      
    37 According to the Crown, the fact that conversation occurred in the breaks during the recording process while tapes were being changed was neither remarkable nor improper. It should not be overlooked that this was not an interview of a suspect, but a conversation designed to elicit from a witness an initial account of the relevant events. 
     
      
    38 The Crown submitted that the procedure of having Mr Morgan repeat the conversation onto the tape upon resumption was an adequate means of capturing additional information he had provided during breaks, bearing in mind that the purpose of the interview was simply to create a record of Mr Morgan’s account from which a statement could be prepared. 
     
      
    39 The Crown submitted that no impropriety had been demonstrated for the purposes of s.138 Evidence Act 1995, let alone impropriety causally linked to the obtaining of Mr Morgan’s evidence. It was submitted that no basis had been demonstrated under s.138 for exclusion of Mr Morgan’s evidence. 
     
      
       
      Determination 
       
      
    40 As Sully J observed in his judgment of 29 March 2005 (page 8), the focus of the present application is not upon Mr Morgan, but upon, in particular, Federal Agents Dametto, Wills and Wildman. Sully J summarised the Accused’s challenge to this evidence in the following way (pages 8-9): 
     
      
       
        
        “It can be accepted readily, and I do accept, that Mr Morgan was at the time of his first encounter with Mr Dametto and his colleagues, a man with real problems. He had a gambling problem; a broken-down personal ‘relationship’; a conviction that sooner or later the police would come knocking on his door in order to speak to him about his relevant involvement with the present applicant; and a completely understandable fear of finding himself in prison. In all of those senses it is, I think, quite correct to describe him, as the applicant’s submissions do, as having been vulnerable to any improper police pressure. 
         
         
        The present application does not focus, however, upon that vulnerability insofar as its existence might diminish Mr Morgan's credibility in the eyes of a jury at trial. It focuses, rather, on a proposition that the relevant police officers saw Mr Morgan, from the time they first began to look seriously at his position in the relevant scheme of things, as somebody who was on the outer rim, so to speak, of the criminal enterprise that they were investigating, and who, because of that fact, coupled with his perceived personal fragility, might be willing, if handled properly, to become a Crown witness. 
        
       
       
        
        That proposition is then developed into a further proposition, namely, that the relevant police officers in effect deliberately manipulated and exploited the perceived vulnerability of Mr Morgan so as to set him up as an available, and very useful, Crown witness.” 
        
       
      
    41 In the course of his judgment, Sully J adverted to observations of Stephen and Aickin JJ in Bunning v Cross (1979) 141 CLR 54 at 75: 
     
      
       
        
        “There is no initial presumption that the State by its law enforcement agencies, will in the use of such measures of crime detection observe some given code of good sportsmanship or of chivalry. It is not fair play that is called in question in such cases but rather society's right to insist that those who enforce the law themselves respect it, so that a citizen's precious right to immunity from arbitrary and unlawful intrusion into the daily affairs of private life may remain unimpaired.” 
        
       
      
    42 Although the decision in R v Ho provides no assistance to the Accused on the present application, I note the understandable recognition of Ireland J, at 42, of the importance “from the community’s point of view of encouraging persons involved in criminal activity to afford assistance to authorities and to give evidence”. 
     
      
    43 Sully J expressed the following conclusions on the application (pages 10-13): 
     
      
       
        
        “1. The police were perfectly entitled to approach Mr Morgan and to endeavour to interview him. 
         
         
        2. Had Mr Morgan been not a potential Crown witness who was regarded as having been on the outer rim of the relevant enterprise, but a primary suspect who was very much at risk of becoming an accused, then the police would have been not any the less entitled on that account so to have approached him. 
         
         
        3. In so doing with Mr Morgan as such a primary suspect the police would have been constrained by various well-recognised rules. They are conveniently summarised in the Court judgment in  
        R v Plevac 
         (1995) 84, A Crim R 570 at 578-582. The first two principles thus summarised are in my view very much to the present point. They are, case references omitted, as follows: 
         
         
          
           
            
            ‘1. Police may in the course of investigation interrogate a suspect who is willing to answer their questions and that interrogation may include, putting to the suspect the facts that the police know or believe or suspect of them to be, in order to ascertain what, if anything, the suspect will say about them. 
             
             
            2. Such questioning must be fair and must not amount to intimidation, persistent importunity, or undue insistence or pressure; but questioning is not to be regarded as unfair merely because it is persistent.’ 
            
           
          
         
         
        4. It is complained that it was improper of Mr Dametto to have told Mr Morgan that he was the subject of allegations of involvement in the relevant tax minimisation schemes. I do not agree. The fact is that he was alleged to have been so involved, whatever might have been thought about the degree of that involvement. 
         
         
        5. It is complained that it was improper of Mr Dametto to have cautioned Mr Morgan, and to have drawn Mr Morgan's attention to the right to professional advice and assistance. I do not agree. I see no breach of relevant public policy merely in the giving of such warning and advice. I can imagine a case where, listening to the actual tape recording, one heard the words spoken in tones of unmistakable menace; but that is not the applicant's present case. 
         
         
        6. The questioning that in fact took place on 6 April 2000 has the blemishes of which I have earlier spoken 
         [the use of leading questions and continued conversation during breaks between tapes] 
        ; but I do not accept that even with those blemishes, the questioning infringed the principles noted at 3. above. 
         
         
        7. It is complained that the formatting of the statement of 29 April 2000 is suspect, especially in its use of direct speech. Were it proposed to tender at trial the actual document, then it would be necessary to explore in more detail than has thus far been done, how the statement was compiled, proof-read and formatted. No such tender is, however, in prospect. 
         
         
        8. Mr Morgan gave evidence on the voir dire, and there was every opportunity to test him as to any intimidation that is said to have been applied by the police. I am wholly unpersuaded by anything I heard from Mr Morgan that he has any such complaint. Such evidence as he gave on the point seems to me to tend to the contrary. 
        
       
       
        
        In sum, then, I am wholly unpersuaded that the applicant has established any proper basis for my preventing the Crown from presenting Mr Morgan, warts and all, before the jury at trial as a willing Crown witness; and from seeking to persuade the jury that, notwithstanding the close and vigorous cross-examination to which it can forecast that he will be subjected, the jury ought to accept his evidence as credible, in whole or in some relevant part or parts.” 
        
       
      
    44 Cross-examination of Mr Morgan and Federal Agents Wills and Dametto before me did not, in my view, provide the Accused with any assistance in support of this application. If anything, the evidence of Mr Morgan emphasised his ability to take independent and measured legal advice from his solicitor in the period between 24 March and 6 April 2000 which provided him with the opportunity to exercise his own free will, without pressure, concerning his decision whether to co-operate with the AFP investigators by providing an induced record of interview on 6 April 2000 (PT791-792, 2007).  
     
      
    45 I have incorporated substantial parts of the judgment of Sully J in this judgment. Given the manner in which the application was argued before me, this course seemed apt. Nevertheless, I have brought my own independent judgment to bear upon the evidence and arguments advanced in favour of and against the Accused’s objection under s.138 to the entirety of the evidence of Mr Morgan. Like Sully J, and for similar reasons, I am entirely unpersuaded that a foundation has been established for a finding of impropriety for the purposes of s.138 Evidence Act 1995. 
     
      
    46 The approach adopted by AFP investigators to Mr Morgan does not give rise to a finding of impropriety. AFP investigators believed, on reasonable grounds, that Mr Morgan had been involved criminally in activities involving the Accused. To the extent that the acts and words of AFP investigators led Mr Morgan to believe that his position was serious and that he may be in jeopardy, that was an accurate understanding of Mr Morgan’s position. No misrepresentation was made to Mr Morgan.  
     
      
    47 It is common, acceptable and expected practice that police investigators will, from time to time, speak to a suspect with a view to that suspect becoming a Crown witness. The process of taking an induced statement to be considered by relevant prosecuting authorities is not uncommon. It is for the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions, and not police officers, to exercise the statutory power to determine whether an undertaking will be given under s.9 Director of Public Prosecutions Act 1983 (Cth). What occurred in this case, on the evidence, provides no foundation for a finding of impropriety on the part of AFP investigators. 
     
      
    48 I accept the submissions of the Crown that it was good practice to tape record the conversation which took place between AFP investigators and Mr Morgan on 6 April 2000. The tape recording has been retained and is available to the Crown and counsel for the Accused. This is desirable practice, but does not always occur. 
     
      
    49 The asking of a number of leading questions by investigators on 6 April 2000 has given rise to some controversy in this case. I do not detect any impropriety in the leading questions asked and observe that detailed responses were given by Mr Morgan. Generally speaking, it is preferable to avoid the use of leading questions in an interview with a potential witness, as opposed to a suspect. That said, the use of some leading questions in this case does not provide a foundation for a finding of impropriety under s.138 of the Act. 
     
      
    50 Insofar as complaint is made about continued conversation during breaks between the four tapes on 6 April 2000, it is appropriate to observe that AFP investigators, upon resumption of each tape, took steps to ensure that any matters raised during the break were placed on tape by Mr Morgan. Again, I detect no impropriety in the approach adopted by AFP investigators.  
     
      
    51 Other matters relied upon by the Accused, including the subsequent disposal by Mr Morgan of notes used by him during the 6 April 2000 interview (PT794, 2007), do not give rise to a finding of propriety. With respect to Mr Morgan’s notes, I observe that he appears to have utilised them directly and expressly in the early part of the interview (Exhibit VR4, Tab 1, page 1). It appears that Mr Morgan repeated the contents of his notes, at least in that part of the interview. 
     
      
       
      Conclusion 
       
      
    52 In my opinion, the evidence adduced on the present application falls far short of demonstrating impropriety on the part of AFP investigators in their dealings with Mr Morgan culminating in him becoming a Crown witness in these proceedings. 
     
      
    53 The application to exclude the evidence of Mr Morgan under s.138 Evidence Act 1995 is refused.

    SENTENCE1 HIS HONOUR: The offender Mouhamed Haddad appears today for sentence in relation to, as I understand it, five counts of armed robbery with a dangerous weapon committed respectively on 8 March, twice on 13 March, once on 15 March and once on 17 March 2006, one count of robbery in company committed on 5 March 2006 and one count of detain for advantage in company occasioning actual bodily harm committed on the same date and at the same time in effect as the robbery in company committed on 5 March 2006.2 The offences, with the exception of the robbery in company, which I will describe as the principal offences that he has pleaded guilty to and are the subject in due course of sentencing orders, each carry a maximum penalty of twenty-five years imprisonment. The offence of robbery in company carries a maximum penalty of twenty years imprisonment.3 I am also required to take into account on two Forms 1, one count of armed robbery committed on 11 March 2006, two counts of armed robbery with a dangerous weapon, in fact the same dangerous weapon, committed on 13 March 2006 and 17 March 2006, and one count of assault with intent to rob committed on 7 March 2006. The maximum penalties of the offences on the two Forms 1 vary from twenty-five years imprisonment to fourteen years imprisonment.4 The offender, who is now aged eighteen and will turn nineteen in mid-March of this year was aged seventeen and/or had just turned eighteen at the time of the commission of the various offences. The detail of his age at the relevant time I will expand upon later. 5 The charges with which I am concerned, both principal charges and matters on a relevant Form 1, arise out of his arrest on 17 March 2006. After the events of that date he was subsequently arrested again on 9 May 2006 and again on 23 May 2006 in relation to other charges unknown at the time of his initial arrest. I am informed that the prisoner was in custody from the date of his arrest on 17 March 2006 until 6 May 2006 when he was released to bail. Apparently his bail continued despite the fresh arrests on 9 May 2006, however he returned to custody on 23 May 2006. 6 In my calculation of the matter the sentences that I will impose, at least those that are to commence from the date he came into custody, will commence from 4 April 2006 to reflect the time spent in custody in relation to these charges. As I understand the matter from the material that has been presented to me, there is no standard non-parole period that applies to this accused in respect of any of the matters to which he has pleaded guilty. 7 As I understand the matter none of the offences that he is charged with, notwithstanding the varying dates upon which he was arrested, were offences committed whilst on bail or subject to any other conditional liberty. The criminal history supplied to me and the other information establishes that at the time of the commission of these offences the prisoner had no prior criminal convictions or findings of guilt.8 This matter comes forward in a somewhat unusual manner because there are four indictments, and as I said two Forms 1. The facts in relation to the various charges on indictment and related matters on a Form 1 are set out in various facts sheets that have been prepared, it would appear, by police and which are not the subject of any objection. I propose to briefly summarise the facts in relation to the respective offences, however clearly I have taken into account all the facts that are disclosed. It would take far too long to read everything that is contained in the relevant fact sheets.9 In relation to the first two offences in time, they are the offences committed on 5 March 2006 of robbery in company and detain for advantage in circumstances of aggravation. At 2.15am on Sunday 5 March 2006 the victim Mohamed Hussain, who was a twenty-two year old, was working as a console operator at a service station in Bass Hill. The prisoner drove his vehicle, a 1989 Corolla with false number plates, to one of the petrol pumps and obtained a quantity of petrol. There were two other unknown males occupying the vehicle. The young person and the other unknown males entered the service station, some items were taken from the shopping section of the area where the console operator was, and then eventually one of the unknown males approached the victim, grabbed him around the neck, told him to turn off the lights and the till was emptied of $991.20 and a number of items were stolen, including a large quantity of cigarettes valued at $5,368. 10 The victim was spoken to in Arabic by one of the men in company with the accused and the victim was then dragged from the petrol station and placed in the prisoner’s car after someone had said “let’s take him and dump him”. The victim was man-handled and placed under physical pressure whilst sitting in the back of the car, the prisoner driving the vehicle. There was conversation in Arabic in the presence of the victim and the victim was very scared. He was threatened by one of the unknown males sitting at the back of the car. The victim was told that one of the men had a gun and he would shoot him. The prisoner drove the vehicle around for a period of time and ultimately the victim was pushed out of the car at George’s Hall in circumstances that are set out in the facts.11 The victim was able to observe the number plates on the motor vehicle and then walked until he was assisted by police. The fingerprints of the prisoner were found on the items that were dropped on the floor behind the sales counter and when he was arrested in relation to other matters inevitably he was linked to this particular crime. When he was arrested on 17 March in relation to other matters, he was found to be in possession of a replica pistol which ultimately linked him to other crimes as well.12 The second indictment concerns three counts of armed robbery with a dangerous weapon, as I said, committed on 8 and 13 March 2006 at places in western, inner western and southern Sydney. 13 In respect of the first count on the indictment to which the prisoner has pleaded guilty there are three counts of robbery offences, or assault with intent to robbery offences, committed between 11 March and 17 March, again in various locations, in southern, inner western and western Sydney. The weapon used by the prisoner for the commission of the second offence on the Form 1 is, as I understand the matter, identical to the weapon that was used in the principal offence on this indictment and the other two offences. The weapon that was used in relation to the offences on this indictment was located when the prisoner was arrested on 17 March after a police pursuit. The prisoner was driving a vehicle which had stolen number plates on it. 14 `During the interview on 17 March the prisoner made admissions in relation to an armed robbery offence in the St George area and made admissions in relation to his possession of a replica pistol. He also admitted owning clothing which was linked to other robberies. 15 The first offence in time on the indictment in the principal offence for the purposes of the Form 1 matters occurred at Liverpool when the prisoner in company with another male entered a convenience store. He was wearing distinctive clothing at that particular time. This time, as opposed to the earlier occasion where he was more a follower than a leader, he demanded money from the victim. He pointed a silver coloured pistol later recovered from him at the victim and cash in excess of $500 was taken. In this matter closed circuit security television depicted the accused pointing the firearm at the victim as the co-accused stood nearby.16 The second offence involved the prisoner driving to a service station on the Princes Highway Kogarah. He was on his own this occasion on 11 March. He had a knife with a four inch blade and demanded the victim empty the till. He threatened to stab the victim. He demanded a plastic bag from the victim and filled the bag with packets of cigarettes, sixteen in total. Total proceeds from the robbery amounted to in excess of $490. Again, he was wearing a distinctive jumper with the words “New York” on it which appeared to be the same jumper as that used earlier on 8 March.17 On 13 March he robbed a service station at Enmore Road, Enmore, in company with another male. He produced the same firearm found on him on 17 March. He made demands for money. The co-accused had a screwdriver and demanded money. On this occasion the prisoner was observed on closed circuit television wearing the same distinctive jumper. Total proceeds of the robbery amounted to in excess of $800. This offence was committed in the early hours of the morning as with the other offences when the victim, as in the other occasions, was alone.18 Another armed robbery was committed on 13 March 2006 when the prisoner entered a convenience store in Canterbury. Again he approached the victim, who was working at the counter area, armed with a silver firearm. He demanded cash from the cash register. The victim fearing for his life opened the cash register and the prisoner reached over and removed the cash tray taking $1000 in total. Closed circuit television depicts the prisoner wearing the same New York jumper that was referred to earlier and carrying the same silver-coloured firearm to which I have earlier made reference.19 On 11 March 2006 the prisoner entered a convenience store situated at 338 Princes Highway Blakehurst. He, after obtaining a drink, produced the same silver-coloured firearm and told the victim to turn off the lights. Fearing for his safety the victim complied. He demanded cash from the cash register and he removed proceeds from this location including cigarettes and some other items of property of a value in excess of $1,400. 20 At 8.50pm on Friday 17 March he entered the service station at Sefton, particularised as I understand it on the Form 1. He made a demand of the victim for money, the victim being of course the console operator. He had earlier made some inquiry about a legitimate purpose. The victim pressed what is called a panic button. The prisoner became alert to the fact that perhaps some duress alarm has been pressed. The prisoner was wearing a ‘New York’ motif-ed jumper. The prisoner then ran out without taking any cash and this offence forms the third matter on the Form 1 that I have referred to.21 Thus in relation to those facts, to correct any error that I may have previously made, the offences at Sefton, Canterbury and Kogarah appear on the Form 1, and the offences variously at Liverpool, Enmore and Blakehurst are offences on the indictment, with the offence committed at Liverpool being the principal offence for the matters on the Form 1.22 The third indictment is concerned with an armed robbery committed by the offender at Liverpool on 15 March 2006 whilst armed with a dangerous weapon. The facts regrettably are distressingly similar to the facts of a number of the other matters. The prisoner in the early hours of the morning went to a service station in Liverpool. He seemed to be involved in legitimate business within the store and then removed from his clothing and produced the silver-barrelled firearm demanding money from the victim. He pointed the gun repeating the words. There was a bit of a stand-off, the victim claiming that he could not open the till. The prisoner demanded that the lights and the cameras be turned off. He then told the victim that if he didn’t open the till he would kill him. The till was eventually opened. The prisoner was in company with a co-offender who sought to remove coins from the tray. There was a time where the victim made his way to a staff room under the pretence that he could do something in relation to the lights, but there he locked the door denying access to the prisoner and his co-accused. The victim then telephoned for assistance. The prisoner and his co-accused sought to gain entry. When the victim left the staff room he saw coins on the floor and a total of $1,200 in cash was missing. The arrest of the prisoner on 17 March 2006, of course, linked him to this robbery, amongst other reasons, because of the firearm that he used.23 Finally on 17 March 2006 at Granville the prisoner with the use of the same silver replica pistol robbed another victim at a service station. The victim again was a console operator. It was late at night on this occasion but still at a time when the victim would have been relatively vulnerable. The prisoner was observed on closed circuit television entering the store. He purported to be undertaking a legitimate transaction. He removed the silver pistol from his jumper, pointed it at the victim and again made demands for items from the till. The victim removed the black cash tray from the register and handed it to the prisoner. The prisoner took that and walked from the store. It would appear that the prisoner on this occasion was again wearing a ‘New York’ emblazoned top and he was arrested it would seem on the material available to me within an hour. 24 At the time of his arrest, not only was he in possession of the same top and the firearm, the police in their search found a number of other items which as I understand it had some relationship to the circumstances of the previous offences committed that night. 25 The other offence committed on 17 March which appears on the relevant Form 1 was a robbery committed at 11.15pm of that day, that is, shortly before he was arrested and after the earlier offence committed at Granville. Again it was a robbery of a console operator at a service station. Again the prisoner was wearing the clothes that he was found wearing later on. The prisoner again pointed the firearm at the victim, made demands upon the victim, asked for the tray, picked up the cash tray and ran from the service station.26 When the prisoner was arrested he had $575 in his possession. It is alleged that from this particular service station at Revesby he took $580 from the cash tray and the cash tray itself cost $150 to replace. On the facts that have been provided to me by the prosecution I could not find details of precisely how much was taken during the course of the Granville robbery, although the facts do say that he took the cash tray from that location. 27 This sustained period of criminality over a relatively short period of time is a very distressing state of affairs, distressing in a number of ways. Firstly and primarily distressing because of the large number of victims who were involved, many of them were threatened, one particularly who was beaten, and all who were I can fairly say vulnerable and powerless in the face of the prisoner and at relevant times, co-accused. I have made the point in relation to the first two matters in time that it would appear on the facts available to me the prisoner drove the car but took a lesser role. But it is clear that the prisoner took a leading role in those matters where he committed offences by himself, for example on 17 March, and other times. Even when in company with others, took a primary role in relation to those matters.28 It is distressing as well, to note that the community is at peril from people such as the prisoner who are so young. As I earlier pointed out most of these offences were committed when he was seventeen about to turn eighteen years of age. And of course the almost inconceivable aspect of it in some respects is that he had no prior criminal convictions before he went on this particular spree. Any explanation he has given for his conduct barely does justice to explain why he should involve himself in such criminal activity.29 In relation to the prisoner’s background I note from the material available to me that he was born in Australia, his parents are from the Lebanon and he is the second eldest of five children. He has an older brother who is twenty years and a number of younger siblings including two younger sisters. From what I gather his other siblings are law-abiding as are his parents. His family situation deteriorated when he was about twelve or thirteen when his parents broke up and there is some suggestion of some domestic violence towards his mother and considerable disharmony at that time. This does not seem to have had an adverse effect upon his siblings, but apparently has had an adverse effect upon the prisoner.30 He has grown up in straitened financial circumstances. The family has survived largely on social security benefits. The family is poor and socially disadvantaged, I accept. They lived in a Housing Commission area and they did not have much in the way of material goods. The mother is a devoted mother and I will turn to her evidence shortly. The prisoner has, he claims, close relationships with his siblings and he described his upbringing to be normal. 31 At school apparently he was, in his later years, said to associate with what are described as delinquent peers and his behaviour deteriorated over a period of time and he had difficulty concentrating on his schoolwork. He has little in the way of academic qualifications having completed year 10 and not continuing his senior studies. Apparently he has had very little, if any, proper employment. He has done some work for an uncle in a tiling business but nothing of a permanent or sustained nature. 32 The psychologist reports he has an unremarkable medical history and he presented as a relatively uncomplicated person.33 With regard to his mother’s evidence, which I have taken into account, much of what she has said is in support of the history the prisoner has given both to the psychologist and the Department of Juvenile Justice officer. The mother confirmed the family’s situation and the hardships for the family, particularly since the separation of her from her husband. She gave evidence that in the months or so before his arrest there were changes in his personality suggesting, in not so many words because English was very much a second language for her, isolation of the prisoner from his family, his secretiveness (to use my words), evidence of some confusion and frustration and some anxiety or fear which was apparent at the time of the commission of the offences. 34 It is suggested by the offender that he was under some threats in relation to gambling debts and other debts, and whilst there is some evidence of some anxiety or fear there is nothing really concrete to connect what was seen by his mother to what the prisoner claims to be threats made to him. She said he appeared to be anxious or fearful in circumstances which might suggest confirmation of his claim that these robberies were committed to settle debts arising from drug usage and gambling. But there is no reliable evidence of this fact. The prisoner has given no direct evidence of it, and the evidence of it or the evidence of his motivation for committing these robberies for those reasons comes from out of court representation. I do not conclude that these crimes were committed out of fear rather than for the need for money. It is clear that the prisoner committed these crimes for money and it seems to me his aggressive and persistent conduct is inconsistent with a person conducting crimes because of fear for his own safety or for unrelated reasons.35 To his mother and the psychologist he claimed pressing financial difficulties from gambling and drug debts. As I have said, none of that material as he presented it to the psychologist or the Juvenile Justice officer being untested and hearsay in character raises any defence or ultimately provides any real mitigation of this criminal conduct. But in the context of the fact that he had no prior criminal convictions, these types of pressures, if they existed, may explain how he became involved in this uncharacteristic behaviour. I must say it is disquieting to see the enthusiasm with which he embraced this type of conduct to obtain money for whatever purpose.36 The facts of the first crimes in time, on 5 March 2006, suggest an association with others more experienced in criminal conduct. As I said earlier he did not take a leading role in the assaults upon the victim and the victims detained for advantage, that he is liable for his involvement in both crimes as being a participant quite clearly in a joint criminal enterprise with others. His participation was significant when one considers that he drove the vehicle at relevant times.37 That having been said, and noting his claims of negative peer pressure or influence from older antisocial elements, it is to be further noted that a number of offences to which he has admitted his guilt were committed whilst he was by himself and not in company, and whilst in possession of weapons that he himself had acquired and were in his exclusive possession. 38 The replica weapon for example was a real pistol converted to a cigarette lighter on his version. Admittedly he said in an interview with police that he had had the relevant pistol in his possession since he was “a little kid”. There is no confirmation of that. The knife used in the course of at least one of the robberies he claimed to have found in the street, but also he claimed that he subsequently threw it away. As I said, the pistol was in his possession on the date of his arrest and ultimately linked him to other robberies with which he was later charged and which may have been unknown to the investigators at the time. I note that the weapon is a replica and although clearly it would have terrified anyone at whom it was pointed, it was a weapon, as I understand it, incapable of discharge. It was, in its character, a weapon incapable of inflicting grievous bodily harm unless it was used as a bludgeon. But still it would have been, given the fact that it was once a real weapon, very frightening for the victims. It is still regarded at law as a dangerous weapon and thus attracts in its use a greater maximum penalty for the relevant armed robberies in which it was used. However, it is an objective feature to be noted that the weapon clearly was not loaded or capable of discharge because of its conversion.39 On the evidence available to this court and in all that has been put there are no offences in which the offender claims to be affected by prohibited drugs at the relevant time the offences were committed. When arrested on 17 March 2006 the offender denied the use of drugs in relation to the matters then under investigation, and from what I can gather from the material, it would appear shortly after these offences were committed on 17 March that he did not appear affected by drugs, at least to any significant degree.40 In any event, ultimately, allowing for the histories given of drug abuse, use of cannabis, some use of methamphetamine and some effects upon him of methamphetamine, the matters that arise for consideration in the armed robbery matters concerning the relevance of drug addiction to the sentencing exercise, are of such a character as to not invoke much of what has been said of this topic by Wood J at para 273 of the judgment of Henry, the guideline judgment in relation to armed robbery matters, to which I was taken in submission and to which I will refer shortly.41 I have had regard to the submissions of all the parties. Most of the submissions of course came from counsel for the accused, although in fairness the Crown noted some of the observations I made to the prisoner’s counsel in the course of the submissions made by Mr Shaw. The learned Crown’s brevity is not a subject of criticism of course. He has succinctly and skilfully conducted the case for the learned Director of Public Prosecutions. The various submissions that have been raised, I have and will deal with either expressly or implicitly.42 On the basis of what I have been advised I accept that the plea of guilty has high utilitarian value for the reason advanced by his counsel and that the prisoner should receive a discount of twenty-five per cent upon the otherwise appropriate penalty in respect of each matter in accordance with the guideline judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal of Thomson and Houlton. The pleas of guilty were entered on indictment but as I understand it the prisoner was committed for sentence and the matters proceeded because of some defect in the committal papers. In any event the Crown agrees that the pleas were entered at the first reasonable opportunity and that appears to be the case. I also accept that his pleas of guilty are an expression of contrition on his part, bearing in mind also that some of the offences were admitted to police when interviewed, although some were either denied or were not disclosed. There may have been some difficulties in relation to separate trials concerning some of the offences. I note also some cooperation the prisoner provided to police which assisted the prosecution of him through admissions that he made.43 They were the offences, as I said, that were committed when he was a young person. He turned eighteen years of age on 14 March 2006 towards the end of this spree. Those offences, which comprise most of the offences that are serious indictable offences, are to be dealt with according to law in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act. 44 Naturally and inevitably he must be dealt with according to law for all offences with which I am concerned, including those committed as a juvenile, and including those that are not serious indictable offences. Amongst other reasons, offences committed after he turned eighteen are matters that must be dealt with according to law whether serious indictable offences or not under the relevant legislation to which I referred.45 To some extent the facts of this matter emphasise the artificiality of the age of eighteen as a division between culpability as an adult and culpability as a young person in some cases. In this particular case, even though the prisoner became more and more experienced as a criminal, I doubt that he was any more mature on 17 March as he was on 5 March. 46 Of course in relation to the offences committed as a juvenile, s 6 Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act is still relevant. It should be noted of course that the relevant offences were committed very close to his eighteenth birthday and this course of conduct continued after he turned eighteen. In a sense, the benefit of s 6 of the Act in the sentencing process is a “diminishing return” for him as one travels through the course of conduct. I also bear in mind many authorities dealing with the sentencing of young offenders, particularly those authorities dealing with serious offences committed by young persons with no prior criminal convictions. I need not cite authority for the proposition that special attention for a range of reasons needs to be given to the circumstances of young offenders such as this offender, even allowing for the sustained and detailed criminality. Ultimately, even in this case with a series of criminal acts over a period of time, some leniency should be extended to him by reason of his youth and lack of maturity, and also to promote his rehabilitation. 47 I acknowledge that it has been said on a number of occasions that young persons who commit serious crimes and act as adults can expect to be treated as adults. One of the leading judgments on this issue is that of the late Lee J in the decision of Pham going back to 1991. But his Honour’s comments must be seen in the context of the facts of the particular case. It seems that whilst there is an adult character to much of this criminal behaviour, one cannot get away from the fact, as I have pointed out, that the prisoner initially was led into this spree by what would appear to be more experienced criminals, albeit that he showed an independence of mind after the event.48 I also bear in mind in sentencing the prisoner that there might be a lack of sophistication said about these offences as serious as they are. He did little or nothing to disguise himself when committing the offences save for on some occasions having some cover over his head. He failed to wear any type of protection apparently for his hands to prevent the transmission of fingerprints. He was linked to the offences on 5 March 2006 by latent fingerprints found on cigarette packets. On a number of occasions he wore distinctive clothing which was readily identifiable from closed circuit television and was in fact either in his possession or linked to him at a later time. One might have thought that the identification as the perpetrator of many of these offences, once he was apprehended, was inevitable given some of the distinctive features observable from closed circuit television including his clothing and the type of weapon that he used.49 The offences could not be described therefore as I said as sophisticated and they may be said to have involved minimal planning. Although it should be noted that it is admitted by the prisoner that the dangerous weapon was in his possession over a lengthy period of time, albeit for most of that time for innocent purposes. Whilst the individual planning of each offence may have only taken a short period of time it is to be fairly said too that the prisoner was travelling around Sydney to commit these offence and attending upon suburbs that one might have thought were well outside his bailiwick, such as at Kogarah and Blakehurst. There is an inference there to be drawn that he was looking for locations in the early hours of the morning to rob. Clearly, given the course of events, he was thinking about the commission of these types of offences over a number of days.50 In sentencing him in relation to each offence I am required to apply the principles laid in Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610, particularly the majority’s, observations at para 45. In this particular matter, assessing the totality of the criminality and trying to structure the sentences appropriately to give proper weight to Pearce in light of a number of other competing considerations including his youth is a particularly significant but difficult task.51 I accept as part of the background of this, as I have said, that he came from a disadvantaged background, both culturally and financially, that he will however continue to have the support of his mother and siblings on his release from imprisonment. Certainly a disadvantaged background, both culturally and financially, is no excuse for committing serious crime. But it seems to me, as a matter of experience and general knowledge, that persons in his position are more susceptible to the temptations that this type of crime offers, albeit that that is inexcusable.52 I have referred to the fact that the prisoner had little employment. In fact he was generally unemployed before the commission of these offences. He had had no training of any formal type and he appeared not to have undertaken any extensive education courses.53 Close attention on his release from custody obviously will need to be paid to his education and employment situation to avoid the situation that arose him of idle time, indolence and financial problems leading to serious criminal conduct.54 Whilst of the material available to me, particularly the accused’s version of the commission of the first two crimes in March, some of the matters that were discussed by Wood J in para 273 arise for consideration, such as drug usage affecting judgment, obtaining money for drug usage et cetera, these matters arise as a relatively minor matter in the scheme of things and provide little mitigation for the reasons discussed by his Honour and approved by the rest of the Court. This is particularly so when one looks at the latter course of conduct where the prisoner does not appear at least to be affected by drugs even if he may have been trying to get money to settle drug debts. It is to be fairly said that there is nothing in Henry that says that having drug debts is some sort of passport or excuse for committing serious crime.55 I agree with the submission put by his counsel that by reason of the need in this matter to partially accumulate sentences by reason of his youth, by reason of the fact that this is his first term in custody, and the fact having regard to the psychologist’s report and the Juvenile Justice report that he does need supervision on release to assist him in relation to drug and alcohol counselling, gambling counselling and direction in relation to employment and education programs, that there are special circumstances that warrant an adjustment of the relationship of any relevant non-parole period to the total sentence. Accumulation itself is a special circumstance, but special attention must always be drawn to sentencing young offenders who are to go to gaol for the first time. This was a matter of particular comment, if my memory serves my correctly without researching it, of Wood J in the key decision in relation to s 9 of the Sentencing Act, of The Queen v Moffitt (1990) 20 NSWLR 114. 56 I also refer to judgments such as Blackburn and Walters, a decision of again Wood J speaking for the Court of Criminal Appeal in 2001 where his Honour, a very experienced and wise judge, specifically approved South Australian authorities such as Yardley v Betts and other judgments stressing the need in sentencing young offenders, notwithstanding clearly the need for punishment, to also consider rehabilitation and the ultimate goal that serves all sentencing exercises. That is in the appropriate case, providing a prisoner with an opportunity for rehabilitation which will make that person a better member of the community. Ultimately this not only serves the purposes of the prisoner, but it serves the purposes of the community. 57 I am mindful also of what has been said about these matters in the guideline judgment of Henry where the learned Chief Justice approved with some explanation what Mahoney ACJ had said in The Queen v Lattouf an unreported judgment. There, Mahoney ACJ, talking of sentencing principles and the need for appropriate punishment and the like said: 
     
      
      “General principles must of their nature be adjusted to the individual case if justice is to be achieved. For this reason it is in my opinion important in the public interest that the sentencing process recognise and maintain a residual discretion in the sentencing judge. There is public interest in the adoption and articulation of sentencing principles that will deter the commission of serious crime and punish those who commit it. But there are other interests to which the sentencing process must have regard. These are other objectives which the sentencing process must seek to achieve. Paramount amongst these is the achievement of justice in the individual case.” 
      
    58 Of course from the viewpoint of the victims and perhaps the wider community, justice in this individual case means condign punishment. But condign punishment in a case such as this must be restrained when one has regard to all the known factors.59 In relation to known factors I have taken into account the psychologist’s conclusions in relation to the matter. I note his finding that the accused appears on the testing conducted by the psychologist to be at the lower level of intellectual capacity or achievement. Of course the validity of this testing, given the cultural circumstances of the prisoner, is not overwhelmingly made out. But I do accept ultimately that the psychologist is his testing has identified that the prisoner, because of either innate or inherent characteristics, or because of educational background, has limited intellectual capacity. The psychologist seemed to suggest that it may be in the lowest two or three percentile. I am not here to second guess the psychological assessment. I do note the psychologist herself pointed out that the prisoner seemed to be foxing in relation to an assessment to the degree of his depression. That having been said, there is nothing in the background of the prisoner to suggest that he is a person of great intellectual accomplishment. Whilst nothing has been put to me about the matter of the relationship of intellectual incapacity, if it may be described as that, and the causal relationship of that to the offending, ultimately, on the basis of the material, I could not conclude that there is a direct causal relationship other than to make the general observation that a less intelligent person might be more prone to rash or stupid or unacceptable behaviour. 60 There is no issue that arises, to put it simply in this matter, of issues that were discussed in decisions such as Engert, or before that, Letteri, and more recently in cases such as Israil and Hemsley. But his lack of intellectual achievement and accomplishment is still relevant to the sentencing process. As I have said, it might make him more susceptible to stupid behaviour or behaviour of this type, or particularly it emphasises the need for professional assistance on his release to parole.61 The Juvenile Justice report adds very little to any of the other material before me beyond confirming some of the matters that are the subject of evidence. It raises some influence upon the prisoner perhaps of violence or anger within the family, bearing in mind these offences are crimes of violence of a most serious nature. It discusses a history of substance abuse and gambling difficulties. The assessment in relation to any community based supervision is that such supervision in due course should focus on areas of readiness to change, increased motivational level, drug and alcohol use, gambling addiction, aggression and anger management. He will need to show commitment to attend regular supervision sessions and he will obviously need stimulus to comply with any supervision that is required of him.62 All of these matters in conjunction with those earlier features I identified give rise to a conclusion that there should be in this particular case some significant adjustment of the appropriate non-parole period to give him an extended period of supervision and assist him in his transition to a lawful existence.63 In sentencing the prisoner of course, as I have said in passing, I have had regard to the guideline judgment of Henry, particularly what is set out at paras 162 through to 180. This is a case where many of the characteristics are in accordance with the indicia that were summarised by the Chief Justice at para 162. On the other hand there are, to use his Honour’s words, a number of circumstances which appear in a more aggravated form, including the use of a replica firearm, the amounts taken, the use of force on the first occasion, albeit by others, the particular vulnerability of the victims in the early hours of the morning where that occurred, committing offences in company other than those pleaded in relation to the events of 5 March which are themselves taken into account in the maximum penalties that I disclosed.64 The guideline provides some guidance one would think in the context of a guideline suggesting, giving the characteristics of an offender set as out by his Honour of the type particularised at para 161. But the total sentence I am imposing falls short of what is appropriate to give full effect to general deterrence. There is however in this matter the requirement which has arisen since Henry to give a discrete discount for the utilitarian benefit of a plea. This very aspect of the matter was discussed in Houlton and Thomson as having some effect upon the guideline previously pronounced in Henry, and of course there are special features of the case which the judges in Henry recognise will always arise. 65 I have had regard to s 3A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and for the purposes of sentencing many of them are dealt with expressly in the course of this judgment. In relation to the aggravating factors that arise under s 21A I have already concluding that there was some planning in relation to these offences. Some offences were committed in company of course when that element was not pleaded. I do not take it into account as an aggravating factor, where it is pleaded, for the reasons set out in subs (2) that an aggravating factor is not to be taken into account as such if it is an element of the offence. In this particular matter I take into account that practically all the victims were vulnerable. I appreciate one must deal with this on an individual charge by charge basis, but it would be abundantly apparent where offences were committed in the early hours of the morning as many of these offences were, or in the late night, each of the victims alone was a vulnerable person. 66 In relation to s 21A(2)(m) I note its terms are, “the offence involved multiple victims or a series of criminal acts”. In this particular matter none of the individual offences involve multiple victims or a series of criminal acts and each offence has to be the subject of an individual sentence. However, of course putting aside the particular statutory provisions of s 21A(2), it could be fairly said that the offences for example committed on 17 March, might be viewed more seriously given the previous conduct of the prisoner leading to the commission of those offences. 67 With regard to mitigating matters I have concluded that these offences were not part of organised criminal activity. At the time the prisoner did not have any record of previous convictions. I am prepared to accept that relevantly before the commission of these offences the prisoner was a person of good character. I cannot conclude, given the character of the offences, that he is unlikely re-offend, he seems to have developed a taste for this type of conduct. However with appropriate guidance and with some structure in his life outside of gaol he may have good prospects of rehabilitation. I take hope from the support of his family. I accept that he had shown some remorse for the offences by his limited cooperation with the police and his expressions of regret to others and the plea. The plea itself is a mitigating factor to be taken into account as provided for by s 22 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, but it should be borne in mind it is also a matter attracting a discrete discount for the utilitarian benefit of the plea of guilty.68 In any event it is noted in the section itself that the fact that any particular aggravating or mitigating factor is relevant and known to the court does not require the court to increase or reduce the sentence.69 I have had regard to some judgments that might assist me. The wisdom of superior courts for comparative sentencing purposes is not to be ignored. I have had regard to Regina v Perrin [2001] NSWCCA 422 and Regina v Mohamadin Tarek [2004] NSWCCA 401. No cases are immediately on all fours with this particular matter. Each case must be dealt with on its merits. But it is clear that there must be, for this offender, a term of imprisonment imposed, notwithstanding the terms of s 5 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. 70 I also note that I am required in sentencing the prisoner in relation to particular principal offences to take into account the matters on the Forms 1 in relation to the first count. In the second indictment there are three matters to be taken into account. I have noted what the guideline judgment says about taking matters into account on a Form 1. Such offences taken into account can actually alter the appropriate sentence for the principal offence. It can make the sentence longer or it can change its character. There is no question of course that the matters on the Form 1 here change the character of the sentence and they certainly, in their terms and detail, put into context the criminality for which the prisoner is to be sentenced. That is, the principal offences and related offences set out in the indictments.71 The full facts in relation to the matters before me, both on indictment and the Forms 1 have been taken into account and although the matters on the Forms 1 themselves do not require any calculation of an appropriate sentence, they certainly provide as I said a proper context for the sentencing exercise that I must undertake.72 Thus in relation to the matters that I am to sentence the prisoner for I will make the following orders. In relation to all offences on indictment the offender is convicted and dealt with according to law.73 In relation to the offence of robbery in company committed on 5 March 2006, the prisoner is sentenced to a term of imprisonment of three years to date from 4 April 2006. That term of imprisonment will expire on 3 April 2009.74 In respect of the detain for advantage in company occasioning actual bodily harm the prisoner is sentenced to four years imprisonment. That is to be entirely concurrent with the first sentence to date from 4 April 2006 and to 3 April 2010.75 In relation to the first count on the second indictment, that is, the indictment alleging the offences on 8 March 2006 and 13 March 2006, in respect of the first count, that is the offence of 8 March 2006, the prisoner is sentenced to a term of imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of two years with the balance of sentence of four years. The non-parole period will commence on 4 April 2008 and expire on 3 April 2010. The balance of the sentence will expire on 3 April 2014. In respect of that sentence I have taken into account the three matters on the Form 1. I also find special circumstances for the reasons I have identified.76 In relation to the second and third counts on the indictment the prisoner is sentenced to a term of imprisonment by way of a non-parole period of two years to date from 4 April 2008 and to expire on 3 April 2010, and in respect of each of those offences I fix a balance of sentence of three years. That is, each sentence to expire on 3 April 2014. 77 In relation to the third indictment, the offence on 15 March 2006 of armed robbery with a dangerous weapon at Liverpool the prisoner is convicted. He is sentenced in relation to that matter to a non-parole period of two years imprisonment to date from 4 April 2008 to expire 3 April 2010. I fix in relation to that sentence a balance of sentence of three years to expire on 3 April 2013.78 In respect of the matter of the armed robbery at Granville with a dangerous weapon committed on 17 March 2006, which is the offence on the fourth indictment, taking into account the matter on the Form 1 relevant to that charge, the offender is convicted. He is sentenced to a term of imprisonment of two years by way of non-parole period to commence from 4 April 2008, expiring on 3 April 2010. The balance of sentence for that matter will be four years. That means that the balance of sentence for that matter will expire on 3 April 2014. I trust I have indicated that that sentence will be imposed taking into account the matter on the Form 1.79 HIS HONOUR: Before I go any further Mr Crown are there any matters of a factual nature that I erred.80 FINLAY: I’m only nitpicking your Honour but you did say that the record of interview with the accused was on 17 March. It was 18 March 2006.81 HIS HONOUR: I’ll correct that in the revised judgment. Am I right in saying however that the first armed robbery in time on 17 March there are no particulars as to how much cash taken?82 FINLAY: That’s correct.83 HIS HONOUR: The cashbox was taken but there’s no detail as to the loss.84 FINLAY: That’s right.85 HIS HONOUR: I couldn’t find it, I should have asked you about that but as you know I took this matter and a lot of things were going on. But that’s correct, I thought I must have missed something in the facts. Mr Shaw are there any technical matters?86 SHAW: No your Honour.87 HIS HONOUR: Mr Haddad, the total sentence I have imposed is eight years with a non-parole period of four years. That will date effectively from 4 April 2006 and your non-parole period should expire on 3 April 2010. You will not automatically be released to parole because I cannot direct that you should be released to parole. I don’t propose to impose any conditions of parole. I hope that the Parole Board will have my reasons for judgment and assess you at the appropriate time. And what is needed to be done for you at the appropriate time may be different than the situation now. To my mind, others may disagree, I believe for an eighteen year old person who was a juvenile during the course of this conduct with no prior criminal convictions, this is a significant sentence. But I can assure you of one thing, if you’d been in your early twenties with some history of criminal conduct, particularly a history of violence of these kind, you could have expected a non-parole period of eight years or longer, such is the seriousness of them individually and seen in conjunction with one another. Do you understand that? So if you feel aggrieved about the term of imprisonment you’ve received you can be rest assured that if you get out and commit crimes like this again we’ll be talking about double figures. And it’s highly likely come 2010 and beyond that when we talk about sentencing offenders for these types of offenders we might even be dealing with mandatory penalties where judges have no discretion or very limited discretion. You can take a seat thanks very much.88 Do you want to speak to your client Mr Shaw now?89 SHAW: Yes your Honour.90 HIS HONOUR: I don’t want to keep the court staff too long, we’ve had very long day. The court recorder’s been here since 9.30 and going flat out, so I’ll give you an opportunity to speak to your client now. Thank you Mr Crown, thank you Mr Shaw, I’m sorry to keep you, and thank you for the court staff for all their work during the day.

    SENTENCE1 HIS HONOUR: Kyla Burrows appears for sentence today on four offences of obtaining money for herself by deception. When sentencing her for one of those, the most serious of the offences on the indictment, she asks that I take into account a further thirty-eight similar matters. 2 These offences all arose as part of the ongoing dishonest enterprise which Ms Burrows conducted in order to feed her drug addiction. Ms Burrows was awaiting sentence for supplying a prohibited drug, the prohibited drug being heroin. Despite being on bail for this matter she continued to use drugs herself.3 She applied for and was successful in obtaining a job with a bathroom design company. As part of that job she was given access to the accounts of the company, which she was able to access electronically. She was able to transfer various funds and pay various suppliers. It was her responsibility to see that the company’s bills were paid.4 A very short time after she began employment with this company she began to divert company moneys to her own purposes. A cursory glance at the company’s accounts would not reveal what the offender had done. She simply electronically transferred company moneys into accounts she controlled, either herself or with her boyfriend, but made it look as though the money had been used to pay the company debtors. This was not a terribly sophisticated scheme and one that was always going to come undone when someone who was owed money by the company made an enquiry as to why they had not been paid.5 Shortly before things came unstuck for Ms Burrows she resigned, I gather in anticipation of her being sentenced for the drug supply matter. Shortly after that one of the people who was owed money by the company rang one of the company’s principals and enquired why a bill had not been paid. This caused the principal to have a look at the company’s accounts and what the offender had been doing was immediately revealed.6 Quite clearly there are a number of aggravating features of the offender’s conduct which must be reflected in the sentence I impose upon her.7 Firstly, as I have mentioned, she was on bail. Secondly, she has abused a position of trust that the company placed upon her. Thirdly, this was a planned and organised dishonest scheme.8 I should mention that those last two aggravating features are common in offences of this nature and so I must be careful not to double count when I consider the extra punishment that should be imposed on the offender because of those aggravating features.9 The offender was eventually sentenced for her drug supply matter. She received a non parole period of twenty months, to date from 8 January 2006 and to expire on 7 September 2007 and eligibility for parole of sixteen months to expire on 7 January 2009. Quite clearly the sentence I impose upon Ms Burrows must have an element of accumulation, but I must bear in mind the principle of totality. For that reason the crown tendered to me the facts surrounding the drug supply offence for which the offender had earlier been sentenced. 10 There are matters in Ms Burrow’s history which suggest the desirability of a longer than usual period of eligibility for parole. I will refer to some of them in due course, but now is a convenient time to mention a problem which has existed for sometime.11 When a judge comes to sentence an offender, who is already serving a sentence for what is a more serious matter, and where that person has, on the existing sentence, been given an extended period of supervision on parole, it is an unfortunate but necessary consequence of the subsequent sentence that that period must be eaten into. What happens is that often the new non parole period is too low to reflect the criminality of an offender’s conduct and the period of eligibility for parole is too short in view of the need for an offender to be supervised upon release from custody. But that, as I have said, is an unfortunate but necessary consequence of the way the law says that sentences must be imposed accumulatively on existing sentences.12 The offender is now thirty-one years old. She had a troubled schooling and began to use drugs at a relatively young age. A police officer once told me when I enquired whether he had much experience in drug related crime that he thought that almost all crime was drug related. So it appears to be in the present case. The offender tried heroin at eighteen and has been using intravenously on a daily basis from when she was twenty-three years of age. There were some episodes when she was drug free, but on each occasions she has relapsed. Her drug use led, I gather, to her drug supply activities. Her drug use, which she recommenced upon release on bail, also led to these present offences. Heroin is a not a cheap commodity and so the offender was unable to supply her drug habit and that of her boyfriend from legitimately obtained moneys. But she had a choice. She could either do something about her drug addiction, recognising that she could not afford to use drugs at the level she wanted to, or she could, and she did, obtain money illegally and spend it on drugs. 13 It is not the case that those who use drugs are incapable of making choices as to whether they will commit illegal activity. It may be harder for them, due to the physical and psychological effects of drugs than it would be for a person who was not a drug user, but it is certainly not the case that it can be said that Ms Burrow’s moral culpability is low. She took the decision to steal and abuse a position of trust in order to fund her drug habit.14 Despite Ms Burrows troubled schooling and despite her drug addiction she has been able to demonstrate that she can be a productive member of society. One of the jobs she had whilst she was on bail was with the Trading Post. She performed exceedingly well in that position. It is even suggested that while working for the employer from whom she stole she also, somewhat paradoxically, reorganised their accounts to the benefit of the company. This is a case where Ms Burrows has a lot to offer society and will be able to do so if she is prepared to deal with her drug habit. She has made efforts to do that whilst in custody, but she tells me, and I accept it immediately because it is consistent with what I know about life in women’s prisons, that it is difficult to obtain access to counselling, it is difficult to obtain access to psychologists and it is difficult, therefore, to deal with the underlying issues that have led to someone taking drugs in the first place.15 Ms Burrows does report that she does have underlying issues which have contributed to her drug use. She has memories of, what I will call inaccurately “distressing events”. I am not entirely clear whether those memories are accurate or not, but one thing is undeniable and that is that she has those memories. This is one of the reasons an extended period of supervision whilst on parole would be to Ms Burrows’ benefit. It would, of course, also be to the community’s benefit, because anything that can be done to assist Ms Burrows to overcome her drug addiction and become a productive member of society not only helps Ms Burrows but helps the community as well.16 Ms Burrows pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity, although an indictment was presented in this matter and she pleaded guilty today before me. She had earlier entered pleas to all matters at the Local Court. I will discount the sentence I would otherwise have imposed, therefore, by 25 per cent to reflect that circumstances.17 These offences were serious and ongoing. The fact that there are matters on the form 1 to be taken into account in relation to the fourth matter on the indictment demonstrate a need for a greater weight to be given to retribution and personal deterrence that would otherwise be the case.18 Ms Burrows’ offences were regular and ongoing. They started soon after she began working for her employer and only stopped when she left that employment. I do recognise this is not a case where the offences only stopped when the offender was detected, that is a significant matter in the offender’s favour. Also in her favour is that she must have recognised that she would be detected as soon as a person whose bill had not been paid questioned her employer. Despite that circumstance she did not run away, but remained living at her address and so was easily found by police when they came to arrest her on these matters.19 The offender is remorseful. I accept that she is sorry for what she has done. I accept that she recognises the significant impact that her dishonesty has had on a small business and more importantly the people who expend a great deal of hard work, I am sure, in running that business. I accept that the offender has good prospects of rehabilitation, but they will depend significantly on the offender’s attitude towards drugs upon her release from custody. It is within her power to overcome her drug habit. It is something that she needs to choose to do upon release from custody. 20 This is a matter where compensation is sought. It is appropriate that I make an order for compensation in favour of Candana Designs Pty Limited. Despite the fact that the offender is in custody and will continue to be there for sometime I expect that she will eventually be in a position to commence repaying her employer for the money she has taken from them. She gave evidence in court today of a willingness and preparedness to do so. I will accept what she says in that regard and so I will make the compensation order sought by the crown.21 The sentences I impose are as follows: On counts 1, 2, 3 and 5 on the indictment Ms Burrows is sentenced to imprisonment for a fixed term of twelve months, to commence on 8 September 2007. Those sentences are fixed terms because of the sentence I will now announce on count 4. I set a non parole period on that count to commence on 8 September 2007, it will expire on 7 September 2008 on which date the offender is eligible to be released to parole. I set a head sentence for that matter of two years. I also make an order for compensation in the sum of $90,059.17 that sum to be paid to Candana Designs Pty Limited.

    JUDGMENT1 HIS HONOUR: A child under the age of seven years is rightly regarded as being completely dependent upon her parents for almost everything. Such a young child looks to the parents for the necessities of life, including a healthy love, protection from harm and sound moral values. 2 R-- whose name is not to be published, was entitled to be regarded by her father as more dependent and needy than most. She was handicapped by ADHD, Rhett Syndrome, Autism, Schizophrenia and a mild developmental disability. She had been placed under the control of the Department of Community Services because of her challenging behaviours. In April 2003 she was in respite care at Rainbow House, a designated controlled premises run by the Department of Community Services. 3 B J N, father of R--, was to have a day out with his daughter on 18 September 2003. In the course of four hours outing, he took his daughter to his home, told her to follow him to the bedroom and, once there, to lie on the bed where he assaulted her and, in the course of that assault, committed an act of indecency upon her. Today he is to be held accountable for this serious breach of trust in conducting himself in a criminal way.4 As a sentencing judge, it falls to me to resolve a number of competing tensions as I strive to determine the appropriate sentence for this offence, before this Court, committed by this offender harming this young victim in this community (see R v Gladue [1999] 1SCR 688 at [80].5 My initial task requires an assessment of the objective criminality of the offence before the Court. I will also need to have regard to matters personal to the offender - known as subjective matters. The starting point for such assessments requires me to make findings of fact from the evidence before the Court relating to the offence and to the offender. An unusual feature of this case is the delay between offending and sentencing. That delay which causes an impact will need to be assessed and what, if any, its impact on the sentence.6 The offender’s rehabilitation prospects will have to be assessed, even if looking though a glass darkly. The question of whether a standard non-parole period is attracted by this offence and, if so, whether it applies in this particular case also needs to be assessed. 7 There are other technical questions relating to deterrence, discounts, whether special circumstances are to be found and, finally, assuming parole is granted, the length of the parole period or the length of the non-parole period. What weight needs to be given to all of these matters against the imperative that all sentencing should have, as its primary focus, the protection of the community will also need to be determined (see Cuthbert (1967) 86 N (NSW) Pt 1 272, Rushby [1977] 1 NSWLR 594 & Hayes [1984] 1 NSWLR 740).Facts: 8 At about 10.30am B J N collected his daughter from Rainbow Lodge. He was with his adult stepson for three or perhaps it may have been four hours. They attended various places. At some point the stepson was dropped off. Then B J N and his young child made their way to the home in Quenulla(?) Road, Toongabbie. 9 Shortly after arrival, the offender told his daughter to follow him to the bedroom. She was then told to lie on the bed, then to remove her clothing. She six year old took off her tracksuit pants and undies and, it would seem, also a singlet. The offender removed his own pants and underpants. The so-called agreed facts state:  
     
      
      “His penis was exposed. The offender then touched R--’s genital area with his erect penis. After a period of time the offender ejaculated onto R--’s groin”. 
      
    10 This account, however, does not appear to be agreed although the defence is content that the offender should be sentenced on these facts. However, those facts are sketchy and do not entirely fit with other evidence. 11 On 16 January 2006, the offender’s account to Indera Devi who was preparing a presentence report for the Court was: 
     
      
      “[B J N] maintains his innocence to the offence. However he stated that on advice he pleaded guilty to a lesser charge. He also stated that his daughter, who is the victim, must have witnessed him in an intimate relationship with his ex-partner when they lived together or with a ‘sex worker’ whom he often calls upon. The offender stated ‘I think she must imagined’”.  
      
    12 On 9 April 2006 he told Gabriel Massoud, who was preparing an updated presentence report for a court appearance on 10 April: 
     
      
      “...that he left out bits and pieces and explained that he felt embarrassed talking to a female staff member about his offence.  
      He stated that prior to the commission of the offence, he engaged in phone sex with an eighteen year old woman. This conversation he said had sent his emotions to an ‘uncontrollable state’ and as such he failed to acknowledge the kinship with his daughter. The offender stated that it was during this period that he masturbated in the presence of his daughter while she lay on the bed with her pants and underwear taken off and left on the floor. [B J N] claimed to have proceeded close to his daughter’s direction (sic) and at the point of feeling a ‘sexual explosion’ he touched his daughter’s vagina ‘but only on the top of the vagina’.  
      Furthermore, [B J N] conceded that in the light of his high sexual arousal he could not confirm or deny that he actually ‘did more than just touch the surface’. However, he added, ‘It could be possible’”.  
      
    13 In June 2006 the account given to John Machlin preparing a psychological assessment for the defence, was  
     
      
      “In the first interview [B J N] admitted only to having asked his daughter to remove her underpants because she had complained of soreness in the genital area. He said the semen that was later identified on her underpants must have come into contact with his inseminated clothes on the floor. Therefore, in the earlier assessment he was denying any sexual contact with the victim.  
      In the second interview [B J N] admitted that he did, indeed, have sexual contact with the victim. He acknowledged that, after the victim’s underpants were removed, he touched her genitals by means of rubbing them (without penetration). He acknowledged that this contact was sexual in nature. 
      [B J N] was intent on pointing out that he did not ejaculate directly into the victim’s groin as was described in the facts. He did, however, report that he masturbated and ejaculated in the victim’s presence. The distinction was important to him because ejaculating into the victim’s groin sounded to him as if it meant sexual intercourse. He related also that he had initially been aroused by a sexually explicit phone conversation with a woman he knew. He described the touching of his daughter as having compounded that arousal”. 
      
    14 In November of 2006 an account was given to Catherine Sahn, a forensic psychologist working with the forensic psychology service within the Department of Corrective Services.  
     
      
      ”As described in the agreed facts on September 10 2003, [B J N], B A [stepson,] with his friend had picked up [B J N's] daughter, R - -, from a respite care facility for a day visit. Later in the day [B J N] took her into his bedroom where she was asked to lay on the bed and her clothing was removed. He then exposed his penis and masturbated over the child touching her vagina with his penis then ejaculating into her groin. The incident was brought to light when the respite carer inquired about the child’s day and noticed that her underwear was inside out. The child then disclosed the incident... 
      [B J N] has denied the sexual offence charges and has provided an explanation for the incident. He described that earlier in the day he had taken his daughter to her grandmother’s where the child complained ‘of a sore bum’ and it was discussed that ‘she was wet due to not wiping herself’. [B J N] went on to describe that later in the day after dropping B A and his friend off, that he took the child back to his home. He then took the child into the bedroom and described that he had removed her clothing and lie on the bed in order for the ‘sun to dry her off’. He described that he then received a phone call from his girlfriend Tracey who engaged in phone sex with him and he proceeded to masturbate and ‘I forgot she was there’. Approximately fifteen minutes later [B J N] described walking around the bed to find something to ejaculate into, then walked to the child while still on the phone and masturbating to touch his daughter on the vagina ‘to see if she was still wet’. He then ejaculated into a singlet ‘then I used that to wipe her off because she was still wet’”.  
      
    15 Exhibited in the crown case is a certificate of analysis from the Analytical Laboratories. Among material for the Analytical Laboratories to analyse, were a singlet and underpants belonging, as I understand it, to the complainant. 16 The singlet was not examined, from which I infer that there was nothing on the singlet attracting the attention of the analytical laboratory experts. However, the underpants were. Semen with a DNA profile consistent with the offender’s DNA profile was found on the underpants. A diagram of the location of the semen on the underpants forms part of the tender. The pattern and distribution of the discarded semen is of significance notwithstanding a caveat expressed in the report that there may be transfer as a result of the folding of garments. 17 One of the respite workers at Rainbow House had noticed the complainant’s underpants were on inside out. The child had complained of sexual abuse to one of the respite workers at Rainbow Lodge. She noticed the complainant’s underpants were inside out. The underpants were seized and thereafter made their way to the Division of Analytical Laboratories. 18 There are four discrete areas of seminal staining. Significantly, all four areas are on the one surface, namely the front of the underpants. There does not appear to be any seminal staining on the rear. Two areas in particular come to the anterior edges of the underpants - that is, up to the elastic in the legs; one on the left-hand side and the other on the right-hand side. There are four stains, only two can be positively said to be located on areas of the underpants coming in contact with the genital region. An elongated stain on the right-hand side appears to run from the inner aspect of the leg in the vaginal region out and upwards. There is also a fourth stain close to the top of the elastic underpants. 19 The situation of the stains satisfies me that they came onto the garment by means of transfer from the body of the complainant. I am satisfied there is some correlation between the location of the stains on the garment and the source of semen that some of them came into on the body of the complainant. 20 I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender did not ejaculat into or wipe himself with a singlet as he told Catherine Sahn. I am satisfied the offender ejaculated onto the body of the complainant in the area of her front, roughly in the region covered by the underpants. I cannot be satisfied he ejaculated into the groin area. 21 I do not accept that the offender lay his daughter on the bed for “the sun to dry her off” and that he subsequently forgot about her. Firstly, the proposition is inherently improbable. Children who soil themselves - or in this case were simply wet as a result of not wiping themselves properly - is not a new phenomenon for parents. In daytime the soiled clothes are removed, the child is cleaned and then, if not put into new clothes, is allowed to run about. That did not happen in this case. If there is a cleanup that is needed to be done, a towel or cloth or something is usually placed between the soiled child and the bed clothes. There is no evidence of that happening. 22 Further, the claim that the underpants were put on her again, they having been soiled or wet, seems highly unlikely because the underpants would also have been soiled or wet. In such a case it is unlikely to the point of unbelievability they would have been re-used without washing or drying. There is no evidence that the underpants were in any way soiled or wet coming out of Rainbow House. For the child to dry herself in the sun suggests she had access to the sun where she lay on the bed. Unlikely as that is in any event, assuming it to be true, curtains would need to be open. In such circumstances, it is unbelievable the offender would wander around his bedroom naked - at least from the waist down - masturbating with a naked child on the bed visible to anyone outside who may be between the bedroom and the sun. 23 Whether the window faced the back, side or front of the house, the dictates of personal privacy are likely to have demanded that he be screened from outside view. 24 Moreover, I am satisfied he did not forget the complainant. He told Gabriel Mascot he touched his daughter but only on the top of the vagina. The point at which he touched the daughter is also difficult to discern from the various accounts. One account appears to have him touching the daughter twice; at the beginning and at the end. Other accounts appear to have him touching only at the time of ejaculation. In such circumstances, it is highly unlikely he would have forgotten his daughter. 25 Further, he said that he became aroused. He could not confirm or deny that he did not touch more than the surface. I reject the offender’s claim that he touched her to see if she was still wet. What follows is that I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the six-year old complainant was incorporated into the offender’s sexual pleasure. I am satisfied there was no soiling or wetting of the complainant prior to her being put on the bed. There is no evidence from anyone at Rainbow House supporting the accused’s account of the complainant complaining of a “sore bum so that she needed to be dried off”. Had the complainant’s bottom been sore, I am satisfied there would have been evidence led of it, particularly in a case where allegations of sexual misconduct were being made. 26 That being so, I am satisfied the complainant was asked to strip as a factor in the sexual and anticipated sexual pleasure of the offender. 27 The offender claimed he ejaculated into a singlet and then used that to wipe the complainant because she was still wet. On his account, he had her take her clothes off because she was complaining of a sore bottom. I have dealt with that. But if her bottom was sore with irritation it makes no sense for him to be touching the vagina to see if she is still wet, particularly after fifteen minutes on the bed. Had she been wet, he surely would have dried her before placing her on the bed clothes. In which case, after fifteen minute, it is unlikely she would still need to be checked as to her wetness. 28 Again, I remark I am satisfied that the offender ejaculated onto the complainant, did not use a singlet to ejaculate into and the complainant was placed on the bed for no purpose other than a sexual purpose. 29 The offender’s account is that he was sexually aroused as a consequence of a conversation with a female named Terry. He reported that he had been “very sexually active with Terry that night”. What is meant by that is unclear. The episode with which I am dealing occurred between 11am and 2pm. It may be he meant the prior night. I am not confident, however, that that is what he did mean. He described the nature of some of the calls to him from Terry as being highly sexual and “She would tell me what she would do to me”. 30 I am not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that there was any phone call to the offender from the person Terry, (in fairness, I should say I am undecided) in which he incorporated the complainant into any sexual fantasy involving Terry, whether with or without her (Terry's) knowledge. If such were the case it would seem to me a seriously aggravating feature. I speculate that the phone conversation has been made up by Bryan New to create a sexual fantasy between himself and an adult in the belief that such a fantasy would be more understandable and more publicly acceptable. As I say, it is only speculation. I cannot say one way or the other that the sexual fantasy phone call occurred. I note that the first mention by the offender of the phone call from the eighteen-year old woman was made on 9 April 2006 - that is three years after the offence. I note also that he “failed to acknowledge the kinship with his daughter”. I am left wondering to whom he failed to acknowledge that kinship.31 On the account the offender now gives, there is a strong inference his daughter is on the bed naked before he is involved in the phone call. I have held that she was naked for his sexual pleasure. Again if there was a phone call, other issues touching his criminality would arise. While the Court cannot act on these matters about which I am undecided, I ventilate them because they do raise issues as to the offender’s insight into his offending conduct and his capacity to be frank with the therapist to advance his rehabilitation. 32 It would be obvious from what I have just said that I have not taken the claimed phone presence of Terry as an aggravating or as a mitigating factor.Objective criminality: 33 From the facts as he finds them to be, the sentencing judge is required to assess the objective criminality of the offence as an essential step in assessing the seriousness of the criminal behaviour of the offender. That is done by comparing, objectively, the cirminality exhibited in this case with criminality of offences of a similar kind. It is in that way that the seriousness of the criminality of this offence can be evaluated. The objective criminality has an important impact upon the overall sentening outcome.34 The sections of the Crimes Act 1900, such as s 61M(2) which creates the offence I am dealing with, are about the protection of young children from a range of experiences while their physical, emotional and psychosexual development is patently immature and the power imbalance between the child and adult grossly favours the adult. 35 The fact that consent of the victim is no defence to an offence under this section highlights the purpose of the section in protecting the young. Lee J, in describing the jurisprudential philosophy behind sections such as 61M, said the following: 
     
      
      “One begins with the proposition that our community views with great concern the sexual molestation of children by adults. And that has been acknowledged by the legislature in providing for greater penalties when the victim is under [10]. That acknowledgement has been in our legislation over a long period. Little children are entitled to grow up free from defilement by sexual predators and free from risk of psychological upset, confusion and difficulties in later life caused by such conduct”. 
      
    36 His Honour also made this observation highlighting the law’s focus upon the power imbalance between adult males and young children: 
     
      
      “The law has always sought to protect young children against sexual predators particularly adult men. The law recognises, of course, as young girls grow up there is an inevitability of contact with sexual overtones and more with members of the opposite sex of the same age or a little older. And that is simply one of the facts of life. But when it comes to a case of an adult male, past middle-age, tampering with girls of twelve and thirteen years of age, the crimes become crimes of enormity.” ( 
      R v Zappallo 
       NSWCCA 5 November 1991 pp2-3. 
      
    37 In this case, of course, the child was half that age.38 I am dealing with a one-off offence of an assault accompanied by an act of indecency by a father upon his own daughter. The assault and the act of indecency is aggravated by virtue of the child’s age, she was six years old. That feature of aggravation is part of the charge against him, therefore it is encompassed in the maximum penalty. 39 There is, however, within that element of aggravation, an increase seriousness of the criminality as the age of the child moves downwards from ten years. In this case the child was but six. The breach of trust by the offender is an aggravating feature, not only because he has offended against his natural daughter, but also because of her health and mental health deficits. In that sense, he has taken ruthless advantage of her vulnerability for his own sexual gratification. 40 That sexual gratification was manifest by seeing her naked on his bed and by touching her vagina, at least for the climax of his masturbation. I am satisfied his ejaculation upon her was deliberate. There is no evidence the sexual exploitation was planned. However, once he took her to his bedroom, he well knew what criminal conduct he was contemplating and thereafter pursued it callously without regard to his own daughter’s welfare. 41 The Crown has sought to argue this offence is at the higher level of offences within s 61M(2). The defence placed the level of offending at a mid-point or a mid-range of seriousness. 42 There is no evidence of any pain inflicted or any threats being made. There is no evidence of any actual physical harm coming to the child. There is no evidence that suggests she was aware of the enormity of what was happening and was expressing refusal or fear. 43 There is, however, evidence of a monumental abuse of power that he had over his daughter and the breach of trust earlier referred to. 44 The consequences of the offence to his daughter are more difficult to determine. She was already plagued by health issues and behavioural issues. She was already separated from her mother, father and siblings. However, the separation, it seems, has now become more formalised. What impact that separation is having, what progression and regression of her behavioural issues would have occurred without this criminal conduct, is moot. 45 The victim impact statement says there has been a deterioration in her conduct. That was likely, even if only as a result of the contagion flowing from the abhorrence of her carers at the way her father has treated her. That is, there is a reactive impact to the offender’s conduct gleaned, in part, from what I suspect the carers feel no matter how they try to hide it. It is the degree of harm that is difficult for me to determine. 46 There is no suggestion this offender became disinhibited or lacked judgment as a consequence of ingesting drugs or alcohol. In that sense, his conduct, while no doubt driven by strong desire, was still, nonetheless, calculated. 47 The crown points out offences such as inappropriate touching outside the clothing would qualify towards the lower range of criminality. On the other hand, says the defence, this is not a representative count (although I doubt whether a representative count is one that was contemplated by the section), nor is it an offence at the end of a long period of similar offending or a day of multiple offences to the complainant within the specific occurrence. 48 The mid-range is not a point but is, in fact, a range of seriousness. So understood, I am satisfied this offence falls within a mid range on its objective features. Victim Impact Statement:49 I turn now to the victim impact statement: I have received a victim impact statement from Bernadette Keegan, a psychologist. The victim impact statement is not sworn evidence and has not been subject to cross-examination. The victim impact statement may, if I accept it as reliable, provide hearsay unsworn evidence as to facts of the offence and as to the effect of those offences upon the victim. 50 The function of statements such as this one, is firstly to give the victims an opportunity of being heard in the sentence proceedings by publicly identifying the impact of the trauma visited on them by the actions of an offender. 51 Secondly, it enables the sentencing proceedings to assist victims as they move towards some closure of grief, resentment and brooding arising from the criminal conduct of an offender, although in this case I must say it is less likely to do so because of the limitations of the victim, including her age and intellectual issues. 52 Thirdly, the victim impact statement contributes to an offender, at least, hearing at first hand and perhaps gaining an insight into, the impact his offending conduct had upon his victim. 53 Finally, the victim impact statement ensures that a Court has a continuing consciousness of the impact violent crime has on those ordinary men and women who are its victims. Let there be no doubt that sexual assaults such as this are considered by the Court as violent offences. As such, victim impact statements play a very important part in the administration of criminal justice.54 In this statement the relevant portions of it, so far as the Court is concerned, are these: 
     
      
      “The impact of the sexual assault on R-- has been all-encompassing. It has affected her behaviour. She has lost her mother, father and siblings, a stable home et cetera.  
      She has recently gone into foster care as a result of the loss of her family. 
      R--’s past, present and future have been affected as a result of the sexual assault. When R-- was sexually assaulted and removed from the home, it was hoped that she would later return to her mother and siblings. However, this did not eventuate”.  
      
    55 I have earlier referred to the difficulties in accurately assessing the impact of this particular offence upon the complainant in her complex case of medical, behavioural and psychological issues. It is for that reason I have edited substantially the victim impact statement tendered by the crown. I still retain some reservation as to whether the loss of the mother and siblings is directly attributable to the sexual assault, but have included it as a claimed impact upon the basis that I understand the argument no doubt advanced by the psychologist that it is a direct impact. Subjective Matters: 56 I turn now to the subjective factors; I am both entitled and required to do that. Not only am I sentencing for the criminal offence, but I am also sentencing this offender for it. 57 Each offender coming before the Court varies from other offenders who stand, or who have stood for sentence. Circumstances personal to the offender may offer to the Court some explanation and insight into the commission of this offence by this offender or some reason why a more, or less, sentencing outcome is appropriate. Family Dynamics and Background58 B J N is a fifty-seven year old single man. His father died of a heart attack in the offender’s mid-teenage years. He was the second of four boys. The father appears to have been a strict disciplinarian. At fifteen B J N was place with a foster family. He claims to have been regularly sexually abused by the foster father. At the time he lost contact with other members of his family. He left the foster home aged eighteen, lived an itinerant lifestyle. At somewhere between nineteen to twenty he was incarcerated, as I understand it, in Queensland. Whilst in custody he was again sexually assaulted. 59 His first relationship occurred shortly after release from prison. There were five children from this relationship, one of whom had cerebral palsy. His wife died of cancer, the oldest son had drug problems and involvement in the criminal justice system. These children were ultimately taken into the care of DOCS. B J N has lost contact with these children, although in June of last year he was saying that he was in contact with one son from this family by phone. 60 In the 1980s B J N found a second long-term relationship. This partner was already pregnant when the relationship formed. The child born carried the offender’s name. They are still in contact. Indeed, B A was with the offender on the day of the offence. In February of 2006, B J N was living with his stepson.61 Subsequently, three other children, including the complainant, were born into this union. His partner and the remaining two children have apparently returned to Melbourne and the offender claims to have lost contact with them. 62 The offender’s mother is aged seventy-nine or eighty. It would seem that he has renewed, since the time of his foster caring, contact with her. In February of 2006, she is described as living in a nursing home. In June of 2006, she is described as living with the offender’s two brothers in Kurrajong. I have assumed that the elderly woman in the back of the Court on the last two occasions is his mother. Education skills and employment: 63 B J N lasted at school until the age of fourteen and a half. He was an average student. His early working career was as an unskilled labourer. He worked in the timber industry for ten years, then became a courier driver for four years. At the time of the offence he was working as a security guard. His licence was revoked. He claims it was because of this charge. There is reason to think it may also have been related to his deteriorating health. There were periods of unemployment, including the period post-charging. His current income stream is provided by Centrelink.Health issues: 64 There is a back problem dating back to his time in the timber industry. He has Type-2 diabetes controlled by diet and exercise. He experiences hypertension at a level requiring continual medication. There are cholesterol issues, ulcers and other health problems. 65 In submissions it was put that his prognosis has him destined for the wheelchair within two years. I have sought among the material before me an evidential basis for this submission without success, but I accept that it may well be so. His GP provides a history of his hypertension low back pain, hyper cholesterol aemia, nocturnal leg cramps, GORD glaucoma and COPD. He had prostate and other associated urinary problems last year. There was a fear of prostate cancer. That caused some delay in the hearing, but ultimately no cancer was detected. Mental health issues: 66 His GP diagnoses anxiety and depression. This appears to be managed by Efexor-XR 75 milligrams. The psychological report acknowledges the history given of depression, but the testing conducted by the psychologist was geared to issues other than depression. I am satisfied the depression is reactive depression related to the offender’s present circumstances. There do not appear to be any other mental health issues relating to general health, causation or rehabilitation issues. Alcohol, drugs, gambling addictions: 67 There is nothing in the evidence before me to suggest any problem relating to alcohol, drugs or gambling. Character and criminal history: 68 Bill Walker, a company director, own/managing his own transport company, writes the following: 
     
      
      “...I have known [B J N] for the past twelve years.... 
       
      I have come to know [B J N] as a man of excellent family values and a person who projected faultless social image.  
      To quote an old clique (sic) ‘That man would give you the shirt off his back’, epitomises the very person who I have always called my best mate. 
      Over the years I have been witness to many of his kind deeds. I have also fallen victim to some of his over-commitments in a help him out capacity. 
      I have witnessed [B J N] care for his children on numerous occasions and never once felt compelled to question his methods of so doing.Also as father of five, I would have to state he was perhaps more competent than myself and a few of our friends in this area of child raising.  
      In the earlier stages of knowing each other, I had hired [B J N] to work for me in one of three companies that I had then owned. He had worked his way up to a supervisory position through determination and hard work, and not favouritism, until his moving to Victoria approximately five to six years later. 
      I’ve been informed by [B J N] of the charge he faces. I can assure you that my feelings for my best friend have not changed in any a way shape or form”. 
      
    69 The offender does have prior criminal history dating back to 1969. His last prior offending was in 1980. All five of his court appearances have been before the summary jurisdiction courts. There is also a conviction in Queensland that I have already mentioned. None of his prior history relates to sexual offending or any crimes of violence. For the purposes of this sentence, I have put very little weight on his past history. I regard the last twenty-five years as demonstrating a man of prior good character. Attitude to offence: 70 This offender has demonstrated little insight into his offending conduct. His initial account does not sit with others he has given. Later accounts still present with inconsistencies. It is difficult to accept he has yet told the whole truth of the criminal conduct that brings him to the Court. 71 In January of 2006, some three years after the offence, he was proclaiming his innocence, explaining to both Probation and Parole, and to John Machlin, that he was pleading on advice. Subsequent accounts have sought to place him in the best light possible. 72 In May 2006 upon a re-referral to John Machlin, the account he gave changed. He acknowledged “rubbing her genitals” and “touching his daughter”, which he said compounded his arousal. Machlin opines: 
     
      
      “He has a simplistic view of sexual offending. He knows his actions were wrong but lacks the perspective to place them on a scale of severity. There is an emotional immaturity or dependency that prevents him from fully appreciating the victim’s perspective”.  
      
    73 Machlin further opines that the offender is now taking responsibility for his actions. I doubt, though, that he does it with any understanding of his criminality or empathy for the victim. One can take responsibility for offending for a multitude of reasons.Plea of guilty: 74 The offender pleaded guilty to this matter on the day it was set down for trial. In matters such as this, there is a particular utilitarian value. Sexual assault trials are notoriously difficult for the crown. In more than 60 percent of sexual assault trials, juries acquit. A plea of guilty, therefore, should be seen as advancing the administration of criminal justice; first and foremost because the interests of the administration of criminal justice are served through the public acknowledgement by an offender of his guilt. That, as I say, is particularly so in sexual assault trials.75 Pleas of guilt by offenders sustain the community’s confidence in the administration of criminal justice by maintaining the confidence of the community in the investigation of crime and the community’s expectation that those guilty of crime will be held accountable for it. 76 The administration of criminal justice is also served because court time, witnesses’ time, legal expenses and the like are freed so that they can be devoted to other cases. A plea reduces considerably the likelihood of contest in an appeal on the issue of guilt. All of these are important utilitarian factors insofar as the administration of criminal justice in this case is concerned. 77 To all of this should be added that the complainant was saved the trauma of giving evidence and being tested upon it in cross-examination. The offender is entitled to a seventeen and a half percent discount in the circumstances for his plea even though it was late entered.Rehabilitation prospects: 78 Reports from the psychologists place the offender’s prospects of re-offending as in the low/moderate range. One psychologist referred to an eleven percent chance of re-offending within ten years. I regard these reports as unduly optimistic. My findings of fact are more negative than the assumptions upon which both assessments were made.79 In the absence of a sexual partner, and in circumstances where he has an ability to access children, this offender’s lack of insight and empathy for his victim, suggests his prospects of re-offending are greater than that ascribed to him by the professionals. It is to be remembered it took three years for him to acknowledge any role in the offence. I have little doubt in the circumstances of this litigation with the crown there were immense pressure on him to make an acknowledgement. Setting the sentence - Deterrence:80 In modern Australian society there is a very extensive raft of criminal laws passed by both federal and state parliaments. The chief purpose of the criminal law put in place by parliaments is to deter those who are tempted to breach the provisions of the criminal law. Parliament does that be prescribing maximum penalties for those who engage in conduct prohibited by the criminal law. 81 Consequently, when a person is sentenced for a breach of the criminal law, he is exposed to the possible maximum penalty provided by the statute breached. In this case, there is also the provision of a standard non-parole period. 82 Sentencing for breaches of the criminal law requires the sentencing judge to keep in mind those general deterrence aims of the criminal law for the community at large, by keeping in mind the maximum penalties available and the standard non-parole period and their deterrent purpose. 83 There is also a specific deterrence aimed at individuals likeminded to an offender who, but for such deterrence, would be willing to commit crimes similar to those for which this offender is being sentenced. 84 Finally, there is a component of deterrence to be considered personal to an offender with a view to deterring him or her from re-offending. Such deterrence is particularly important in cases where prospects for rehabilitation are not strong or high. 85 The maximum penalty for this offence is one of ten years. It also carries a standard non-parole period of five years. To that topic I shall return shortly. Delay: 86 This offence occurred in September of 2003. The District Court seeks to resolve all matters within twelve months of committal. There was immediate complaint in this matter. My understanding is that there was no undue delay by the prosecution. It appears there may have been two sources of delay; both appear to me to relate to the defence; one a change of counsel and, secondly, awaiting the outcome of medical tests arising from cancer concerns. In those circumstances, I do not view the delay as requiring any mitigation of penalty.Standard non-parole period: 87 A review of the subjective features establishes that the offender pleaded guilty. The standard non-parole period applies usually only in circumstances where there has been a trial. It normally does not apply in circumstances where a plea has been entered. Nonetheless, the standard non-parole period does provide a guideline and an indication that the legislature requires a general increase in tariffs be imposed when court is sentencing. Balancing objective and subjective circumstances:88 When the objective and subjective circumstances are evaluated one thing is clear, a sentence of fulltime custody of some severity is called for. There is nothing in the subjective circumstances that puts this offence below one of mid-range of seriousness. I say that giving full account for what I have called the offender’s general good character.Custodial history: 89 My understanding is that this offender has spent no time in custody. Special circumstances: 90 Both parties agree that this is a case in which special circumstances can be found so that a greater parole period than the so-called ‘statutory norm’ can be set. Factors qualifying this offender for special circumstances include 
     
     First time in custody. 
     Age. He will be about thirty years or more older than the bulk of the prison population. That puts him at greater risk and greater potential for social isolation. 
    91 Health issues indicate the offender’s custodial time will be more arduous for him. They also indicate that he will be more frail than the general inmate population.Sentence: 92 But for the plea of guilty, I would have set an overall sentence of six years. I have discounted that by seventeen and a half percent making, on my calculations, a sentence of four years, eleven months and two weeks overall.93 B J N, I convict you of the offence that you on 18 September 2003 at Toongabbie assaulted R-- and at the time of the assault committed an act of indecency upon her, she then being a child under ten years, namely six years.94 I set a non-parole period for that offence of two years and three months to date from 8 February 2007 and to expire on 7 May 2009. 95 I find special circumstances. 96 I set a balance of term of two years, eight months and two weeks to expire on 21 October 2011.97 I should indicate to you that because the sentence that I have set exceeds three years, parole for you will not be automatic on 7 May 2009. You will have to earn it and convince the Serious Offender’s Review Council - which is a Board that sits to determine whether you are eligible for parole - that you are worthy of it. I would think in your case that would require of you - but it is a matter for you - serious consideration about doing the Sexual Offender’s Program within the prison system.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 ADAMS J: I agree with Howie J 
     
      
    2 HOWIE J: The applicant was convicted by a jury of a charge of robbery with a dangerous weapon contrary to s 97(2) of the Crimes Act 1900. This is an offence that carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 25 years. On 25 November 2005 Hughes DCJ (the Judge) sentenced him to a term of imprisonment made up of a non-parole period of four and a half years and an additional term of one and a half years. The sentence was to commence on 3 February 2004 and the applicant is eligible for release to parole on 2 August 2008. The applicant seeks leave to appeal against this sentence. 
     
      
    3 The Judge recited the following facts during his sentencing remarks. On 3 February 2004 in the early evening the applicant entered a chemist shop in Liverpool armed with a loaded revolver. The applicant approached the counter and asked the owner of the shop whether he kept morphine. He was told that they did not stock the drug and that it had to be ordered. The applicant claimed that he had a prescription for the drug but then produced the revolver from behind his back and pointed it in the direction of the storeowner. He demanded money. The owner opened the till and threw cash onto the counter. The applicant demanded more money but was informed that it was kept in a time delay safe. The applicant took the money from the counter, about thirty dollars, and walked out of the shop. He was arrested a short time later with the revolver tucked into his pants in the small of his back. There were five rounds in the revolver. 
     
      
    4 The applicant stood trial on the basis that he could not recall committing the offence. However, the Crown case was very strong as there was video footage that clearly showed the applicant committing the robbery. The applicant gave evidence that he remembered receiving the weapon from a person he knew as “Sam” although he was not sure when that occurred. He said that he did not know where the chemist shop was and had never seen it before. In cross-examination he admitted that, when the revolver was handed to him, he opened it up and saw five cartridges inside. He said that after that time he had no further recollection of what happened. 
     
      
    5 The applicant was born on 17 January 1949. He has a criminal record dating from 1980 when he was convicted in South Australia of being in possession of a dangerous weapon. In 1993 he was sentenced for offences of armed robbery, possessing a shortened firearm and discharging a firearm to avoid lawful apprehension. He received an overall sentence of a minimum term of 6 years and an additional term of 4 years. That sentence commenced on 3 May 1993 and he was released to parole on 6 May 1999. 
     
      
    6 He gave evidence on the sentencing proceedings. That evidence was to some extent inconsistent with the evidence he gave at trial because he said that the persons who came to the flat with the gun told him that there was morphine at the chemist shop and they wanted it. 
     
      
    7 There was in evidence a psychologist report dated 30 September 2004 that contains some relevant history of the applicant. He was single at the time of his arrest but had been married twice. He had limited contact with the children born of the first marriage. He was living in housing commission accommodation. He had not been in employment since his release from his first prison sentence and was in receipt of a pension. The applicant was in the Fire Brigade in New Zealand, and a member of the Australian Federal Police from September 1972 to October 1973 and he served as a member of the police force in the Northern Territory. He also worked in the mining industry. 
     
      
    8 As to the offence, the applicant told the psychologist that “three young blokes” came to his home and gave him the gun. He could not recall going to the chemist shop and assumed he had been drinking alcohol during the day. He told the psychologist he had been consuming alcohol since he was 18 or 19. He used to purchase ten casks of wine on each pension day before his arrest. He would also drink beer and scotch if he had funds to do so. He had unsuccessfully attended AA meetings at some time in the past. He was admitted to the Alcohol Related Brain Damage Unit at Cumberland Hospital between 7 May and 5 August 1992. He had reported a history of alcohol consumption for 30 years apparently drinking up to 6 litres of wine and a carton of beer daily before his admission. He was diagnosed with a number of alcohol related injuries including “minimal frontal lobe damage”. He complained to the psychologist of seizures, blackouts, head injuries and headaches. He had been diagnosed with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder as a result of his experiences in the Police and Fire Services. 
     
      
    9 The psychological report contained the following assessment:  
     
      
       
        
         
        In practical terms, Mr Tilyard's neuropsychological profile indicates his functional capacity will be greatly undermined by cognitive impairment affecting his ability to attend to, remember and operate on full and accurate information, particularly in busy or stressful situations. Problems with attention, memory and executive capacities would be expected to variably limit application of intact verbal reasoning skills, particularly, once again, in more demanding or stressful situations. Mr Tilyard reports difficulty with problem solving and decision making. I find no reason to doubt this and expect the evident difficulty on testing in respect of generation of ideas and response inhibition (together with probable impaired mental flexibility as documented in 1992) would adversely undermine capacity for reasoning, judgement and sound decision making. Deficits in cognitive functioning would be expected to be exacerbated under the influence of alcohol. 
         
        
       
      
    10 There was a further short report from the psychologist dated 9 May 2005 that contained the following additional information: 
     
      
       
        
         
        I find Mr Tilyard's ability to operate independently and to problem solve and make decisions based on full and accurate processing of information, enabling well rounded reasoning and in turn sound judgement is defective. He is vulnerable to acting on faulty information due to poor attention and very unreliable memory both in respect to what he can recall and the accuracy of that recall. He has difficulty generating novel ideas and/or inhibiting more obvious responses. I do not expect he can think quickly, clearly or effectively in many situations, particularly busy or stressful ones. He may reasonably be expected to become readily confused in the face of stress, novel problems and the unexpected or unfamiliar. I fully anticipate he is thereby more vulnerable to the influences of others around him at any one time, be they in his best interests or not. 
         
         
        In short, I believe Mr Tilyard is susceptible to suffering duress as a result of diminished cognitive capacity due to brain damage. 
        
       
      
    11 There were also in evidence hospital notes from the Liverpool Hospital. These record that the applicant was admitted into the hospital on 29 January 2004 after he had been found wandering the streets in a confused state. He was intoxicated at the time and could not remember the events of the day. He remained in hospital as an in-patient until 3 February the date of the offence. His behaviour while in the hospital was unpredictable and he often wandered out of the ward. On 3 February he complained that he had no money and was given ten dollars to obtain milk and bread until he could attend Centrelink. 
     
      
    12 There was before the Judge a number of reports by a psychiatrist, Dr Carne. The first was dated 9 June 2004. He had assessed the applicant in 1994 and again in June 2004. The report contains a lengthy background of the applicant. He had been admitted to treatment programmes for alcoholism in 1991 and 1992. The report indicates that, when he was released from custody in 2000, the applicant spent a period in a drug and rehabilitation centre before moving to the accommodation provided for him by the Housing Department. 
     
      
    13 The applicant told Dr Carne that he had been told by one of the persons who came to his home that he could purchase the gun for $800. He said that he could not afford it. He was told that a robbery had been arranged at a chemist shop where he could obtain morphine and money and his participation in the “feigned” robbery would be accepted as payment for the weapon. He said that he felt intimidated by the visitors. His memory thereafter was a blank until he could recall being in the chemist shop asking for morphine and then money. He felt it unsafe to return home and was arrested shortly after. Dr Carne thought that the presence of alcohol-related brain damage could have led to “recklessness and poor judgment that could have contributed to his behaviour”. His memory was also severely impaired at the time of the offences. 
     
      
    14 There was also tendered on the applicant’s behalf a report of a psychologist, Dr Westmore, dated 14 June 2005. The applicant gave the psychiatrist an account of the incidents leading up to the offence. He said that three young fellows came to his home and wanted him to purchase the pistol. He checked the weapon and noted that it had five rounds in it. He was told that one of the men had used it the day before. They told him that there was a stack of morphine in the chemist shop and they wanted it. He had some recollection of being in the shop and assumed he was there to rob it. He thought they wanted to get rid of the weapon because he later learned it had been used to shoot someone. He did not remember how much alcohol he had consumed that day. 
     
      
    15 The applicant told Dr Westmore that he had been drinking two to three litres of wine a day up to his arrest. He said that he had been to detoxification centres in the past, the last being in the late 1980s. The psychiatrist reports that the applicant has suffered many of the acute and chronic illnesses associated with long-term alcohol abuse. He stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        From a psychiatric perspective he needs long term community based rehabilitation. This man needs to be in sobriety and if he cannot achieve that state then his prognosis from a psychiatric and general medical perspective is extremely poor. His risks of being influenced by others and acting in a behaviourally disturbed way will also be greatly reduced if he can enter into sobriety. 
        
       
       
      Dr Westmore believed that the applicant had been discharged from the hospital too early. 
       
      
    16 The Judge, on the basis of the material before him, concluded that it was more likely than not that the applicant was suffering the effect of brain damage due to his excessive intake of alcohol. Although the Judge did not think that the offence was “the most serious case” he was of the view that only a gaol sentence was appropriate. His Honour referred to a number of considerations in R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346, the guideline judgment on armed robbery offences. The Judge was not satisfied that the applicant was unlikely to re-offend, being of the opinion that any prospect of rehabilitation was speculative. He found that the applicant was not fully aware of the consequences of his actions and that the offence was at the lower end of offences coming within the section. He was not satisfied that there were special circumstances to vary the proportional relationship between the non-parole period and the term of the sentence. 
     
      
    17 There are two grounds of appeal, the first that the sentence is manifestly excessive and secondly that the Judge erred in not finding special circumstances. 
     
      
    18 In my opinion on the face of it a sentence of six years for an armed robbery with a loaded weapon by a person previously convicted for a similar offence is very lenient indeed. The applicant had no benefit of a plea of guilty and clearly displayed no contrition for the offence. Although he may have had some confused thinking at the time as a result of a brain injury or otherwise, he clearly was aware that he was committing an armed robbery with a weapon that he knew was loaded. Just how he came to go the chemist shop was unclear and his accounts were somewhat conflicting as to what he recalled about the surrounding circumstances. 
     
      
    19 There is little analysis of the relevant sentencing principles during the course of the sentencing remarks. This is not to suggest that a sentencing judge should deliver a treatise on sentencing, but the applicant’s legal representative raised a number of issues during his address and by written submissions to which there is no reference in the sentencing remarks. For example, a significant matter raised was the effect, if any, of the applicant’s mental state on issues such as specific and general deterrence. The Judge referred to it at one stage as “some affectation in his mental capacity due to his ingestion of too much alcohol over the years” but he did not in his remarks consider how this finding impacted upon the applicant’s culpability or the purposes of sentencing as set out in s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. Similarly the Judge referred to the applicant’s epilepsy and acknowledged that it was relevant fact whatever its cause. How it was relevant and what impact it should have on sentencing the applicant was left apparently unconsidered. 
     
      
    20 Many of the submissions made to his Honour and to this Court concerned the relevance of the Henry guideline. The Judge addressed this to some degree during the course of the sentencing remarks by considering similarities between the applicant’s offence and what was considered to be the usual case in the guideline judgment. With respect I do not believe that there is any particular assistance to be gleaned from Henry. The facts and circumstances of the applicant’s offence were very different from those being considered in Henry to the applicant’s disadvantage. Further, the applicant’s offence was more serious: the maximum penalty for the offence considered in Henry was 20 years imprisonment, whereas the maximum in the present case was 25 years. In effect the sentence imposed is marginally outside the Henry guideline, which seems to indicate to me that the sentence was a lenient one. 
     
      
    21 I accept that a relevant consideration to sentencing the applicant was the applicant’s mental state at the time of the offence as this may reduce the moral culpability of the offender, reduce the need for general deterrence and indicate that there would be a more severe impact of imprisonment upon the offender: R v Israil [2002] NSWCCA 255. Further, it was a relevant matter that the applicant had issues related to his physical health that might impact upon his sentence. I accept that none of these considerations seems to have been addressed by his Honour and this amounts to an error in the exercise of his discretion by an apparent failure to take into account relevant facts and circumstances. 
     
      
    22 The Judge said nothing at all about the relevance or otherwise of general deterrence. In fact that topic gets no mention whatsoever despite it being a matter of considerable significance in sentencing for this type of offence because of its prevalence. It was submitted on behalf of the applicant that, by reason of the length of sentence, the Judge should be taken to have placed considerable weight on general deterrence and this was an error in light of the applicant’s mental condition. In the absence of any reference to deterrence at all in the sentencing remarks, I am not prepared to accept that the Judge even took general deterrence into account. His Honour was concerned about the objective seriousness of the offence and it was this, as against the maximum penalty prescribed, that seemed to be the major consideration in determining the sentence. 
     
      
    23 Nor did the Judge mention personal deterrence. It is argued that such a consideration should not apply because of the applicant’s mental condition. Again in the absence of any reference to that topic I am not prepared to find that he gave it any weight. It is argued that the applicant had no apparent insight into the effects of alcohol upon him and, therefore, it was not appropriate to consider personal deterrence. But it does not follow that personal deterrence should not operate in the applicant’s case. He should be made aware by the sentence imposed upon him that, if he continues to abuse alcohol, he runs the risk of committing a serious offence that will result in a significant gaol sentence. 
     
      
    24 In any event, notwithstanding his confused state, there is no suggestion that the applicant did not appreciate that he was committing an armed robbery offence with a loaded weapon by threatening the victims in order to obtain money. His explanations for being in that situation are inconsistent and he was unreliable in his account. I see no reason why, in light of his earlier offence, he was not a proper subject of a sentence that had an element of specific deterrence in relation to his possession and use of loaded firearms. It is the fact that, because of his mental condition he was a potential danger to the community if he came into possession of a loaded firearm. If he lacks insight and the ability to control his use of intoxicating liquor, as was submitted on his behalf, then it is appropriate to have regard to the protection of the community from him provided that the sentence imposed is not disproportionate to the objective seriousness of the offence. 
     
      
    25 At the end of the day I do not believe that any lesser sentence than that imposed is warranted even if appropriate regard is given to those issues that the Judge did not apparently address. It cannot be overlooked that this was the second time that the applicant had intentionally used a loaded weapon to commit an armed robbery offence so that the conduct cannot be considered as an aberration attributable to his mental state at the time. In my opinion the Judge arrived at a lenient sentence even though not through a sufficient and reasoned consideration of all relevant factors.  
     
      
    26 This ground has not been made out. 
     
      
    27 The second ground of appeal is that the Judge failed to find special circumstances. The Judge found that the applicant’s prospects of rehabilitation were not good. He was entitled to come to that view because of what is conceded to be the applicant’s lack of insight into his abuse of alcohol. The Judge seemed to have a view that a person in the position of the applicant had little assistance in rehabilitation. He said: 
     
      
       
        
         
        I am not satisfied that the offender is unlikely to re-offend. Mr Corrish argues that if appropriate rehabilitation is provided than he is unlikely to re-offend. I think that is speculative. Mr Corrish submits the offender has good prospects of rehabilitation. That is the sad part of this whole matter. It seems people with brain damage or mental illness have very little help. 
        
       
      
    28 It is submitted that this passage should be seen as evidencing his Honour’s view that there were inadequate recourses available to assist the applicant. The evidence of Dr Westmore was that the applicant needed long-term community based rehabilitation to maintain sobriety. He says nothing about the likelihood of that succeeding in light of the applicant’s brain damage. The psychologist says nothing at all about the prospects of rehabilitation or what might be offered to the applicant by way of assistance. Nor did the report from Dr Carne deal with the possible treatment of the applicant or the likelihood of his rehabilitation. 
     
      
    29 In my opinion it was open to the Judge to conclude that there were no special circumstances in this case warranting a reduction in the non-parole period. This is a question of fact for the sentencing Judge and this Court should only interfere if the decision was one that was not reasonably open to the Judge upon the material available. 
     
      
    30 It seems to me not to be irrelevant that the applicant had a prior offence and had been placed under parole for a lengthy period yet had re-offended in a similar way shortly after the parole had expired. He had been given numerous opportunities to address his alcoholism in the past and there was little to show that he would benefit from an extended parole period if he were provided with that opportunity. 
     
      
    31 This ground of appeal does not succeed. 
     
      
    32 I propose that the application for leave to appeal be granted but that the appeal be dismissed. 
     
      
    33 PRICE J: I agree.

      JUDGMENT (on tender by Crown of six conversations recorded pursuant to warrant under the  
      Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979 
        
      (Cth) 
      ) 
       
      
    1 JOHNSON J: The Crown seeks to tender, for the purpose of the forthcoming trial of the Accused, a number of conversations between the Accused and other persons which were recorded pursuant to warrant under the Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979 (Cth). The six conversations which are the subject of the present ruling are as follows: 
     
      
       
      (a) conversation between the Accused and  
      “Judy” 
       at 2021 hours on 3 September 1999;  
       
       
      (b) conversation between the Accused and an unidentified female at 2212 hours on 8 September 1999; 
       
       
      (c) conversation between the Accused and John McLaren at 1249 hours on 24 September 1999; 
       
       
      (d) conversation between the Accused and Geoff Strong at 1231 hours on 2 October 1999; 
       
       
      (e) conversation between the Accused and Nick Panos at 1807 hours on 3 October 1999; 
       
       
      (f) conversation between the Accused and Geoff Strong at 1104 hours on 4 October 1999. 
       
      
    2 On 11 December 2006, I heard argument concerning the tender of the six conversations. On 12 December 2006, I announced my decision to admit each of the six conversations. These are my reasons for that decision. 
     
      
       
      Sully J’s Rulings on 14 April 2005 
       
      
    3 On 14 April 2005, Sully J, in a judgment delivered on a pre-trial application before the first trial of the Accused, allowed the tender of conversations (a) to (c) above, but rejected the tender of conversations (d) to (f). In each case, his Honour’s ruling was based upon the relevance test under s.55 Evidence Act 1995. Conversations (a) to (c) were held to be relevant (Judgment, pages 14-17, 19-23). Conversations (d) to (f) were held to be irrelevant and therefore inadmissible (Judgment, pages 26-29).  
     
      
    4 I am not bound by the decisions of Sully J concerning the admissibility of these conversations. With respect to the present tender, I will consider the submissions and material to which reference has been made and I will make my own independent assessment of that material for the purpose of ruling on the admissibility of the conversations. I will have regard to the decisions of Sully J to which I have been taken to assist in this decision-making process: R v Petroulias (No. 1) [2006] NSWSC 788 at [51]-[54]. 
     
      
       
      Relevant Legal Principles 
       
      
    5 With respect to each of the six conversations, the Crown submits that the test of relevance under s.55 Evidence Act 1995 is satisfied and that each conversation ought be admitted into evidence. Mr Sutherland SC, for the Accused, submits that each conversations is not relevant and ought be rejected. In addition, Mr Sutherland SC submits that, if conversations (d) to (f) are relevant, they should nevertheless be rejected under s.135(a) Evidence Act 1995 upon the basis that their probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger that the evidence might be unfairly prejudicial to the Accused.  
     
      
    6 Evidence that is relevant in a proceeding is evidence that, if it were accepted, could rationally affect (directly or indirectly) the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue in the proceeding: s.55(1) Evidence Act 1995. Evidence that is relevant in a proceeding is admissible in the proceeding: s.56(1) Evidence Act 1995. 
     
      
    7 If a question arises as to the relevance of a document or thing, the Court may examine it and may draw any reasonable inference from it: s.58(1) Evidence Act 1995.  
     
      
    8 The Crown submits that, in a number of respects, statements made by the Accused during the various recorded conversations constitute admissions for the purpose of Part 3.4 (ss.81-90) Evidence Act 1995. The term “admission” is defined in the Dictionary to the Evidence Act 1995 in the following way: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        admission 
         means a previous representation that is: 
         
         
        (a) made by a person who is or becomes a party to a proceeding (including a defendant in a criminal proceeding), and 
         
         
        (b) adverse to the person’s interest in the outcome of the proceeding.” 
        
       
      
    9 The terms “previous representation” and “representation” are defined in the Dictionary to the Act in the following way: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        previous representation 
         means a representation made otherwise than in the course of giving evidence in the proceeding in which evidence of the representation is sought to be adduced. 
         
         
        … 
         
         
        representation 
         includes: 
         
         
        (a) an express or implied representation (whether oral or in writing), or 
         
         
        (b) a representation to be inferred from conduct, or 
         
         
        (c) a representation not intended by its maker to be communicated to or seen by another person, or 
         
         
        (d) a representation that for any reason is not communicated.” 
        
       
      
    10 A “fact in issue” is any matter of fact that must ultimately be determined by the jury in order to decide whether the Accused has committed the offence charged. In considering the relevance test under s.55, as Sully J observed in his judgment of 14 April 2005 (page 4), it is necessary to bear carefully in mind that the words of the section, and especially the expression “directly or indirectly”, are words of wide import. 
     
      
    11 With respect to s.135, it should be understood that all relevant evidence led in the Crown case at trial is prejudicial to the Accused, but it is only that of which the probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice which is excluded, that is, evidence which has only slight probative value but which carries with it a probability that it be misused by the tribunal of fact in a way logically unconnected with the issues in the case: R v Serratore (1999) 48 NSWLR 101 at 109 [31]. Evidence is not unfairly prejudicial merely because it makes it more likely that the Accused will be convicted. The prejudice to which s. 135 refers is not that the evidence merely tends to establish the Crown case; it means prejudice which is unfair because there is a real risk that the evidence will be misused by the jury in some unfair way: R v BD (1997) 94 A Crim R 131 at 139; Papakosmas v The Queen (1999) 196 CLR 297 at 325 [91].  
     
      
       
      Conversation (a) Between the Accused and  
      “Judy” 
       at 2021 Hours on 3 September 1999 
       
      
    12 The conversation between the Accused (“N”) and “Judy” (“J”) at 2021 hours on 3 September 1999 is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “N Now look, you just make sure that nothing go if nothing goes wrong I'll be happy okay. 
         
         
        J What do you mean? 
         
         
        N I just don't want to be hassled by the ATO so it can happen then I'll do it and I'll be a lot happier. 
         
         
        J Mm. 
         
         
        N Seriously I'm afraid of those guys. 
         
         
        J Are you? 
         
         
        N Yeah. 
         
         
        J Well what's the worst thing that you've done to them? What's the worst deal you have done? 
         
         
        N Ah I think they know everything now. 
         
         
        J They know everything? 
         
         
        N I think they've work it all out by now. 
         
         
        J Well what have you done? 
         
         
        N I told you favours for people. 
         
         
        J Yeah but what's the worst favour that you did like what? 
         
         
        N Oh it shouldn't really it can't be that bad because it was just giving rulings on things that the ATO was happy to give rulings on. 
         
         
        J Sorry you gave rulings on it that wasn't supposed to? 
         
         
        N Rulings on things that the ATO had already given rulings on and was already giving rulings in other parts of the ATO so actually it wasn't that bad if you think about it. 
         
          
         
        J Well what it why are you scared then? 
         
         
         
        N Because I was a high profile guy I was supposed to be the anti tax avoidance crusader. 
         
         
        J Oh. 
         
         
        N I was supposed to be the one who was supposed to stop everything and yet here I am encouraging it that's why they hate me. 
         
         
        J Yeah but they they won't do anything because they're on the political scale they would why would they wanna. 
         
         
        N Exactly. 
         
         
        J You know it ah what do you call it erm  
        [sic]  
        crucify themselves. 
         
         
        N Yeah. 
         
         
        J But they'd they'd want to cover it up and just get on with it. 
         
         
        N That's what I'm hoping they do. 
         
         
        J Well it's true he did you have have you got any summons or anything? 
         
         
        N No no no for God's sake no no no. 
         
         
        J And ho okay ho did you resign yourself or did they sack you? 
         
         
        N No I resigned before anything went wrong.” 
        
       
      
    13 Before Sully J, the Crown pressed this conversation by reference to Particulars D and M(ix) which provide as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “Particular D - At all times during his employment in the Australian Tax Office (the Accused)’s duties were such that any involvement in the planning, promotion or implementation of tax schemes was a conflict of interest, and a breach of his duty as an officer of the Australian Taxation Office. 
        
       
       
        
        Particular M(ix) - In other telephone conversations with friends and associates Petroulias admitted his role in the issue of the rulings pursuant to the arrangement alleged above, and that he was in trouble.” 
        
       
       
      Submissions 
       
      
    14 The Crown submitted that, in this conversation, the Accused was speaking to a young female whose identity is irrelevant. In the conversation, the Accused referred to the fact that “they know everything now”, thereby tending to confirm the lack of transparency on his part when issuing rulings in the Australian Taxation Office (“ATO”) and the fact that it required considerable time and effort for the ATO to ascertain what he had been doing. The Accused also confirmed that he had been doing “favours for people”, consistent with the allegation by the Crown that the Accused had been acting inconsistently in the way he gave favourable rulings to Productivity Incentive Corporation (“PIC”) schemes, unlike the schemes of other promoters. The Crown submitted that, in this conversation, the Accused admitted that he had caused rulings to be made in circumstances where he “was supposed to be the anti tax avoidance crusader” who was “supposed to stop everything and yet here I am encouraging it”.  
     
      
    15 Mr Sutherland SC submitted that it was necessary to bear in mind that the telephone conversation was occurring at a time when a Senate Select Committee Inquiry was on foot which was examining various aspects of the ATO, including aspects relating to the Accused. He submitted that it is important to relate the alleged relevance of the conversation to the actual charges preferred in the indictment against the Accused. He contended that, when this exercise was undertaken, statements made by the Accused during the conversation were not relevant to the charges brought against him. It was submitted that no consciousness of guilt was evinced with respect to the charges which had been preferred.  
     
      
    16 To the extent that the Accused explained in the conversation that his “favours for people” could not be “that bad because it was just giving rulings on things that the ATO was happy to give rulings on”, Mr Sutherland SC submits that this is far from an admission in relation to the elements of the offences charged. Accordingly, he submitted that the statements of the Accused had no probative relevance to the prosecution case.  
     
      
       
      Decision 
       
      
    17 In determining the relevance of the Accused’s statements in this conversation to this case, it is appropriate to note the charges contained in the indictment: 
     
      
       
      (a) Count 1 - Between about 1 September 1997 and 27 February 1999, Nikytas Nicholas Petroulias did defraud the Commonwealth, in that while an officer of the Australian Taxation Office, he did put the revenue of the Commonwealth at risk by causing Private Binding Rulings and Advance Opinions to issue to taxpayers, by dishonest means (s.29D  
      Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) 
       - maximum penalty - 10 years’ imprisonment); 
       
       
      (b) Count 2 - Between about October 1997 and February 1999 at Sydney, New South Wales and elsewhere, Nikytas Nicholas Petroulias, then a Commonwealth officer with the Australian Taxation Office, did agree to receive a benefit for himself, namely money, on an understanding that the exercise by him of his duty as a Commonwealth officer would be affected (s.73  
      Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) 
       - maximum penalty - two years’ imprisonment); 
       
       
      (c) Count 3 - Between about June 1998 and April 1999 at Sydney, New South Wales, Nikytas Nicholas Petroulias, then being a Commonwealth officer with the Australian Taxation Office, did publish to Richard Llewellyn Morgan, a person to whom he was not authorised to publish, documents which came into his possession by virtue of him being a Commonwealth officer, and which it was his duty not to disclose (s.70  
      Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) 
       - maximum penalty - two years’ imprisonment). 
       
      
    18 In the course of my judgment in R v Petroulias (No. 1), I considered submissions made on behalf of the Accused concerning aspects of the first count on the indictment, being the offence of defrauding the Commonwealth contrary to s.29D Crimes Act 1914 (Cth). I noted (at [96]-[97]) a defence concession with respect to evidence touching the issue of dishonesty. There followed an extensive consideration of submissions advanced with respect to the element of deprivation ([100]-[174]), the element of causation ([175]-[208]) and the element of dishonest means ([209]-[233]).  
     
      
    19 In dealing with the element of causation, I considered submissions concerning the role of the Accused in the giving of rulings relevant to this prosecution. With respect to the element of dishonest means, I considered questions of conflict of interest, discrimination between the schemes of the PIC group and the schemes of other promoters, concealment of the rulings being issued and deception of officers as to the rulings being issued.  
     
      
    20 I mention these parts of my earlier judgment because they bear upon the relevance of statements made by the Accused in the conversation to the charges contained in the indictment.  
     
      
    21 It seems to me that statements made by the Accused in the telephone conversation presently under consideration are capable of constituting admissions that he caused rulings to be made which constituted “favours for people”, in circumstances where the process was concealed so that it would take some time for the ATO to “work it all out”.  
     
      
    22 The Accused’s statement that he “was supposed to be the anti tax avoidance crusader” who “was supposed to be the one who was supposed to stop everything and yet here I am encouraging it” is capable of constituting an admission that he had caused the rulings to be made in a manner which encouraged tax avoidance and which was entirely inconsistent with, and contrary to, the duties which he was obliged to perform in his position within the ATO. 
     
      
    23 I do not consider that the existence of a Senate Select Committee Inquiry as part of the background to this conversation detracts from its relevance to this prosecution. What matters are the statements of the Accused concerning his own conduct which is directly relevant to facts in issue in these proceedings. 
     
      
    24 I am satisfied that the conversation containing these statements by the Accused is relevant and admissible for the purposes of ss.55 and 56 Evidence Act 1995. I propose to admit the conversation. 
     
      
       
      Conversation (b) Between the Accused and an Unidentified Female at 2212 Hours on 8 September 1999 
       
      
    25 The Crown tenders an intercepted conversation between the Accused (“NP”) and an unidentified female (“F”) at 2212 hours on 8 September 1999 to the following effect: 
     
      
       
        
        “NP The worse scenario is that they say that this bloke came up with a really wacky highly theoretical ideas that just didn't apply in practice that's all and was badly misunderstood I think that's … 
         
         
        F No that's not bad that's OK. 
         
         
        NP Well I think that's the way the chips will fall. 
         
         
        F But isn't it bad isn't bad the assumption that you were um that the way you made your decisions was influenced by means which weren't necessarily um erm professional?  
         
         
        NP Yeah. 
         
         
        F And ethical so that's the big problem? 
         
         
        NP Hm. 
         
         
        F Right the stuff the other stuff here OK you've got the strategies you know you've got the intellectual strategies there that's no problem it's the other allegations that you have to find a nice um honest way of … 
         
         
        NP Well the thing is the truth of the matter is my approach worked. 
         
         
        F Yes well then it's good? 
         
         
        NP Well I mean I I achieved more in the ATO in a year and a half that anybody else has ever done I mean it was truly breath taking it was truly amazing stuff. 
         
         
        F You know from what I understand that's not what some of these that is under scrutiny you know? 
         
         
        NP No but that goes to suggest what the strategy was and why it worked why it didn't work. 
         
         
        F But it's not that strategy that's the problem is it? 
         
         
        NP No it's not no it's not. 
         
         
        F Then but I understand that part … 
         
         
        NP No but there's consequences no hold on there's consequences the reason I got results is because I worked closely with certain members of the profession who would assist me in understanding how the market actually operated hence allowed me to get a more fully appreciation of where the … 
         
         
        F And they assisted on the understanding that … 
         
         
        NP That provided they didn't abuse the system and they and they behave according to established ATO procedures that have been established eight years before I even existed in there that so long as they behaved to existing ATO procedures that I would not seek to upset their practice. 
         
         
        F And that would be fine? 
         
         
        NP Yeah. 
         
         
        F So long as there was no sort of social kind of infiltration (implications)? 
         
         
        NP Oh well you know obviously looking for people well Ok in an ideal world it wouldn't be in the ideal world you stand there and you have perfect information and people would know who you are and they come to you but in the real world people don't trust the tax office right so the only way you can ever start the ball rolling is to save the people who trust you more and those who trust you more are those who know you more.” 
        
       
       
      Submissions 
       
      
    26 The Crown submits that statements made by the Accused in this conversation constitute admissions so that the conversation is relevant and admissible in this case. It was submitted that statements of the Accused in this conversation involve concessions that he had aligned himself with one group and displayed favouritism to them. Particular reference was made to the comment of the Accused that “in the real world people don't trust the tax office right so the only way you can ever start the ball rolling is to save the people who trust you more and those who trust you more are those who know you more”. 
     
      
    27 Mr Sutherland SC emphasises, once again, that the context in which this conversation took place involved a current Senate Select Committee Inquiry which, in the conversation, the Accused suggested was “out there to score political points” and as to which, at one point in the conversation, he asked rhetorically whether “they want my head on the platter … or do they want Carmody’s head on the platter?”. He submitted that the Accused’s comments in these conversations could not be regarded as admissions with respect to the offences charged in the indictment.  
     
      
    28 Mr Sutherland SC submits that, at points in the conversation, comments of the Accused were denials of wrongdoing, and not admissions. He submits that the conversation had no relevance and ought not be admitted. 
     
      
       
      Decision 
       
      
    29 In approaching a ruling concerning this conversation, I bear in mind those parts of my judgment in R v Petroulias (No. 1) adverted to at paragraphs 18 to 20 above. I do not think that the context of a current Senate Select Committee Inquiry into the ATO, including the activities of the Accused, affects the relevance of the Accused’s statements to the present prosecution. It is the subject matter which the Accused is speaking of which is capable of satisfying the test of relevance under s.55.  
     
      
    30 The topics which the Accused is discussing bear directly upon aspects of the present prosecution and, in my view, are capable of constituting admissions, in particular, with respect to the elements of causation and dishonest means. Whether they are accepted as admissions, will be a matter for the jury at the forthcoming trial. The fact that there is an intermingling of statements by the Accused which, in some respects, are adverse to his interests, but in other respects, may be favourable to his interests, does not render the statements of the Accused in this conversation irrelevant. 
     
      
    31 I am satisfied that this conversation is relevant and admissible and I propose to admit it for the purpose of the trial. 
     
      
       
      Conversation (c) Between the Accused and John McLaren at 1249 Hours on 24 September 1999 
       
      
    32 The Crown tenders an intercepted telephone conversation between the Accused (“N”) and John McLaren (“J”) at 1249 hours on 24 September 1999 to the following effect: 
     
      
       
        
        “J Well look I tell you what's happening is the um the the accountants in PERTH … 
         
         
        N Yeah. 
         
         
        J Are having a visit next week … 
         
         
        N Mm. 
         
         
        J From people from the PERTH office … 
         
         
        N Mm. 
         
         
        J And they're particularly wanting to see ah the letters that were sent requesting the rulings. 
         
         
        N Mm yeah that's fine. 
         
         
        J Now what I suspect will happen is that they'll say look we got this letter from JOHN MCLAREN. 
         
         
        N Mm. 
         
         
        J And what I wanted to talk to you about ah was sort of what I I mean I mean they're sort of ah taking my advice but do we need to drop in PRODUCTIVITY INCENTIVE CORPORATION I think it's I think that's the way to go isn't it? 
         
         
        N No why? 
         
          
         
        J Well just that it then directs it back to ah the people in Sydney rather than me personally doesn't it? 
         
         
        N Um no because the problem is JEFF said that he'd only done the ten and he's only done the ten so then they will come to you anyway because . . ah they'll come to you and they'll say well hold on JEFF said he's done ten so I think what they're trying to do is piece the picture in pee piece the picture together … 
         
         
        J That's right so if they come to me I'd say … 
         
         
        N Yeah. 
         
         
        J Look I was licensed under by PRODUCTIVITY INCENTIVE CORPORATION um ah RICHARD MORGAN um … 
         
         
        N No don't mention RICHARD MORGAN. 
         
         
        J You don't … 
         
         
        N Because he's oh he's disappeared. 
         
         
        J He has has he … 
         
         
        N Well I haven't I haven't heard a word from him. 
         
         
        J No I haven't either okay so well where did I come up with all this information because the ruling requests exactly the same as ah …  
         
         
        N Oh you got it on. 
         
         
        J … 
         
         
        N You got it on disc from PANOS. 
         
          
         
        J From PANOS okay so PANOS. 
         
         
        N Yeah. 
         
         
        J PANOS is well that's all right so long as I got that that contact that they know about. 
         
         
        N Mm. 
         
         
        J Then there isn't a problem. 
         
         
        N Mm. 
         
         
        J And then basically if they ask me who I've sold to then it's pretty well all the ones that have got the rulings isn't it? 
         
         
        N Exactly. 
         
         
        J So then that ties in that completes that loop? 
         
         
        N Yep. 
         
         
        J Um and that's about it isn't it? 
         
         
        N Yeah. 
         
         
        J Cause at the moment I don't exist as far as they're concerned. 
         
         
        N Oh no you exist yeah you exist see what they're what they're really investigating is they want to they want to know because we because that guy ah that idiot up in Perth is … 
         
         
        J Yeah. 
         
         
        N ...claiming that we have given ruling to single director company situations. 
         
          
         
        J Well that's also wanted to look at was was how it was implemented in … 
         
         
        N Yeah. 
         
         
        J Terms of the ruling now everything is totally legit there isn't any problems at all. 
         
         
        N Oh good. 
         
         
        J Yeah and they've been banks involved with security and all sorts of things so so it's not as if there are any of them are gear are are feeling any sort of ah problem with any of them … 
         
         
        N Oh good good. 
         
         
        J So … 
         
         
        N That's very good. 
         
         
        J So but what I thought was it was a two pronged thing one was to see whether there was any um any any favours being made and secondly whether it was implemented according to the ruling. 
         
         
        N Mmm. 
         
         
        J Now all the accountants are saying implement it exactly according to the ruling everything's been documented everything's legit … 
         
         
        N Mm. 
         
         
        J In terms of any favours well they're not aware of any sort of arrangements … 
         
         
        N Mm. 
         
          
         
        J They simply send letters on their own letterhead to the TAX OFFICE and they got rulings within a week two weeks three weeks … 
         
         
        N Yeah yep yep. 
         
         
        J So I think from that point of view we're okay my only concern was that the a that that the mob over there will then come directly back to me but then they'll know everything about what I've been doing anyway won't they? 
         
         
        N Yeah they they pretty much will they've already got your I mean they've got GLOBAL GROWTH on file so all you have to is just ah just say that ah you know well … you've got nothing to worry about. 
         
         
        J But then but then all these ones were done under the MCLAREN HOLDINGS. 
         
         
        N Yeah well that's fine. 
         
         
        J What I'm saying is fine yes that's right. 
         
         
        N There is if there's but if there's any of them that you haven't got rulings for right? 
         
         
        J Yep. 
         
         
        N If you haven't got rulings for that you don't to tell them about don't … 
         
         
        J Exactly. 
         
         
        N … 
         
          
         
        J That's my feeling yeah. 
         
         
        N You simply … 
         
         
        J Yeah absolutely. 
         
         
        N Forgot you've lost the file you don't keep it.  
        
       
       
      J That's right exactly. 
       
        
         
        N There's no record keeping obligations on you. 
         
         
        J No no you're absolutely right so so you know I'm comfortable with whatever they they know now is really the ah the limit to what I've been involved in. 
         
         
        N Yeah yeah. 
         
         
        J … 
         
         
        N No I've you saw it was a good idea so you asked ah PANOS ah a copy of the disc of ah how it works PANOS sent you a copy of the disc from because we're not you're not competing against him  
         
         
        J That's right 
         
         
        N Because you're in different markets ah and goo  
        [sic] 
         JEFF agreed to it. 
         
         
        J That's right. 
         
         
        N And and in return you give them ideas and that that's how it works. 
         
         
        J That's right. 
         
         
        N Yeah. 
         
         
        J Yep perfect. 
         
         
        N Yeah. 
         
         
        J Okay so excellent so so that's that's sort of um gonna close that loop in terms of the Perth people? 
         
         
        N Yeah.” 
        
       
      
    33 In admitting this conversation at the first trial (pages 17-18), Sully J referred to Particular M(vii) which states: 
     
      
       
        
        “Subsequent to his employment with the ATO Petroulias continued to contact Morgan, Panos, Strong, Gray and McLaren and discussed the progress of the investigation by the ATO and the AFP into their arrangements, as well as the explanations to be given for the issue of the rulings, and the action to be taken in response to the investigations.” 
        
       
       
      Submissions 
       
      
    34 The Crown submits that this conversation involves a discussion between the Accused and a promoter, Mr McLaren, during which they discussed a version of an explanation to be given to investigators. It is submitted that not only does the conversation reflect the joint involvement of the Accused and Mr McLaren and the arrangement alleged, but that the Accused also provides suggestions as to what to say and what not to say, including the Accused’s comment to Mr McLaren “No, don’t mention Richard Morgan”. It will be remembered from my judgment in R v Petroulias (No. 1) (at [257]) that Sully J characterised Mr Morgan in summing up to the jury as “a cardinal witness in the Crown case”. 
     
      
    35 The Crown submits that statements made by the Accused in this conversation are at odds with him being at arm’s length when dealing with PIC applications and are inconsistent with him having an involvement with promoters which could be explained as that of a professional advisor prior to him joining the ATO. Even though the conversation occurs at a time after the Accused had left the ATO, the Crown submits that he demonstrates in the conversation knowledge of activities of the PIC group which can only be explained by the fact that he was a member of it.  
     
      
    36 Accordingly, the Crown submits that the conversation is clearly relevant to the present prosecution.  
     
      
    37 Mr Sutherland SC submits that the conversation is a discussion between tax professionals concerning ATO enquiries at a time well after the Accused had ceased working for the ATO. It occurred shortly after Mr McLaren had been spoken to, at his home, by investigators. He points to the fact that, during the conversation, Mr McLaren states “Now everything is totally legit. There isn’t any problems at all”. Mr Sutherland SC submits that the conversation does not carry any probative relevance to the elements of the offences alleged by the Crown and that it ought not be admitted into evidence. If that primary submission is rejected, Mr Sutherland SC submits that this conversation ought be excluded, in any event, under s.135(a) Evidence Act 1995. 
     
      
       
      Decision 
       
      
    38 I will rule firstly upon the relevance ground and, if that ruling favours the Crown, I will then consider the objection under s.135(a) Evidence Act 1995. 
     
      
    39 A significant issue at the trial will concern the involvement of the Accused with PIC, and his relationship with promoters including Mr McLaren. In my judgment in R v Petroulias (No. 1) (at [185]), I reproduced part of a recorded interview between the Accused (“NP”) and Federal Agent David Wildman (“DW”) on 24 March 2000 to the following effect: 
     
      
       
        
        “DW: Do you have a relationship with PIC? Either PICs? 
         
         
        NP: What do you mean, how many? Oh Hong Kong it is..OK. 
         
         
        DW: The other one? 
         
         
        NP: Yes I do know the one, yes I know the one. You interviewed my exwife Regina? 
         
         
        DW: She was spoken to this morning. 
         
         
        NP:  
        I helped her doing her HR, she was doing her masters degree so I helped her write her masters degree as a result I learnt a lot about HR and my philosophy is this is going to be a growing area, a growing market 
        . 
          
         
         
        DW: Right. 
         
         
        NP:  
        If you defer money into a trust you get a tax deduction that you don't have to pay for much later 
        .  
         
         
        DW: Yep OK. 
         
         
        NP:  
        That wasn't really a tax scheme, now then the offer came to go to the ATO so I mean I was really interested in going along with all of this as a business, I thought it was a fantastic business, urn then I went to the ATO. I went to the ATO and asked them the ATO view and this is all in the ATO internal memos, I was asking around, `is this thing, do we still have this position 
        '. 
         
         
        DW: The position for? 
         
         
        NP:  
        Oh the technical, legal position, is the way we treat the law 
        . 
          
         
         
        DW: Righto OK. 
         
         
        NP:  
        Now if this is the way we treat the law and we've done it since 1992 
        .  
         
         
        DW: Right. 
         
         
        NP:  
        Then it doesn't matter if I give one, a million or sixteen million advanced opinions or rulings, to my father my brother or anybody else, because if that's how we treat the law then that is the law, as far as the ATO is concerned, so why should my brother be treated any disadvantageously, or Nick Panos or anybody else so I had no problem with that 
        , 
         
         
        DW: OK. 
         
         
        NP:  
        But I had no problem with that at all but I also understood the advantage of having them tell me information about what was going on in the market 
        . So you know, did I get a benefit, well what benefit did I get, cup of coffee? A drink? When we met and they told me what was going on. Did I receive any cash at any point in time, was any account ever opened in my name, was any trust ever created in my benefit, was anything ever created in earth. Nothing has ever been done that I have received a red cent. If this was going to happen I wish that, you think to yourself shit at least if you have that benefit or money it would have been (inaudible) What I was afraid of covering my arse is shit and it does look like shit um yeah.”  
        (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    40 The explanation proffered by the Accused in this conversation concerning his relationship with PIC, and his role in the development of the concept, are pertinent to the present tender.  
     
      
    41 Also relevant to this ruling are issues considered by me in R v Petroulias (No. 1), referred to at paragraphs 18 to 20, above concerning the elements of causation and dishonest means. In particular with respect to the latter, statements of the Accused in the conversation are pertinent to questions of conflict of interest, discrimination between the schemes of the PIC group and the schemes of other promoters, concealment of the rulings being issued and deception of ATO officers as to the rulings being issued. 
     
      
    42 Against this background, the subject telephone conversation occurs between a promoter, Mr McLaren, and the Accused at a time when an active investigation is underway with respect to the PIC group. In the conversation, the Accused appears to be discussing with Mr McLaren a likely approach following an interview with Mr Geoff Strong, including suggestions as to what Mr McLaren should, and should not, say to investigators, including the significant suggestion that he should not mention Mr Morgan. The Accused appears to suggest other matters to Mr McLaren, including what he might say concerning Mr Panos and the provision of a copy of a disk.  
     
      
    43 For the purpose of a ruling as to relevance, I am satisfied that the statements of the Accused in this conversation are capable of constituting implied admissions, reflecting consciousness of guilt, with respect to the activities of the Accused with the PIC group.  
     
      
    44 I accept the Crown submission, for the purpose of this relevance ruling, that the conversation is capable of supporting a conclusion that, if the Accused’s dealings with the PIC group were honest and complied with ATO procedure, then it would not be necessary for him to disguise that involvement by making suggestions to Mr McLaren as to what he should say, and not say, to investigators concerning that topic. 
     
      
    45 I am satisfied that the conversation is relevant and admissible in the current prosecution. Accordingly, it will be necessary for me to consider the second leg of the objection, being that under s.135(a) Evidence Act 1995. I will return to this objection, which also touches the tender of conversations (d), (e) and (f), to which I will now turn. 
     
      
       
      Conversation (d) Between the Accused and Geoff Strong at 1231 Hours on 2 October 1999 
       
      
    46 The Crown tenders an intercepted telephone conversation between the Accused (“N”) and Mr Geoff Strong (“G”) at 1231 hours on 2 October 1999. As mentioned earlier, prior to the first trial, Sully J ruled that this conversation was not relevant and rejected its tender. The Crown tenders the conversation before me. It is necessary for me to determine whether it ought be admitted for the purpose of the forthcoming trial. 
     
      
    47 The conversation is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “N Hello. 
         
         
        G. NICK? 
         
         
        N Yes. 
         
         
        G It's GEOFF mate. 
         
         
        N GEOFF how are you sir? 
         
         
        G Good. 
         
         
        G I just had a visit from the Australian Federal 
         
         Police. 
         
         
        N For what? 
         
         
        G They asked me about the minutes of meeting in January. 
         
         
        N Yeah. 
         
          
         
        G And who was present who took them. 
        
       
       
        
        N Yeah. 
         
         
        G All sorts of things. 
         
         
        N Really? 
         
         
        G. Yeah. 
         
         
        N Shit. 
         
         
        G So I just said look I I I can't I said I definitely had a meeting with PETROULIAS PANOS may have been there in that office at York Street … 
         
         
        N Yep. 
         
         
        G I don't recall who kept the minutes I know that there was some minutes floating around … 
         
         
        N Yep. 
         
         
        G But I don't know I didn't have them immediately to hand so they're gonna come back they've also just rang PANOS and asked him about it. 
         
         
        N Really? 
         
         
        G Yes. 
         
         
        N Well I mean I mean what's the big deal here we did have a meeting so who cares? 
         
         
        G Yeah well the problem is you know I don't think those dates were correct. 
         
         
        N Oh well I mean I mean you know jeez I mean dates are not always correct no way a bit ordinary. 
         
         
        G I don't know but I think probably I need to um I'm not on the line we need to talk about that I'm going to we're just about to go away to Noosa for a week its school holidays we're going up there tomorrow so they're gonna back they're gonna talk to PANOS as well. 
         
         
        N Yeah. 
         
          
         
        G They asked me who else was at the meeting I'm just wondering whether if anyone else was there whether they said … 
         
         
        N No just EMMANUEL.  
         
         
        G Yeah. 
         
         
        N Yeah shit why did they come and why did they come today? 
         
         
        G I've got no idea. 
         
         
        N I mean it's Saturday. 
         
         
        G They just showed up at my front door. 
         
         
        N Huh. 
         
         
        G They just showed up at the front door. 
         
         
        N Really? 
         
         
        G Yep. 
         
         
        N What with warrants and things? 
         
         
        G No they just wanted to ask me a few questions. 
         
         
        N Shit god that's getting serious. 
         
         
        G Yeah. 
         
         
        N Yep but at the end of the day there was no money given to anybody or no one did anything and at the end of the day everything was pretty ordinary just benefit trusts just like everybody else's got you know like fucking hell it's not as if you got a ruling which says you can deduct your home loan fuck . 
         
         
        G OK well I might talk to you through the week. 
         
         
        N Yeah. 
         
         
        G And perhaps come down to see you or do something. 
         
         
        N Yeah yeah. 
         
         
        G OK. 
         
         
        N But I mean OK at the end of the day though I mean it's pretty pretty clean I mean there is nothing really to worry about I mean you never gave me any money you never offered to give me any money you've got a ruling that was consistent I mean what what. 
         
         
        G They're investigating the minutes of this meeting and I've got you know … 
         
         
        N Have you got have you got those minutes? 
         
         
        G I'd have them somewhere I just couldn't I tried to find them quickly. 
         
         
        N Yeah. 
         
         
        G How would they have a copy anyway they'd be on the ATO file? 
         
         
        N Well the ATO had a copy. 
         
         
        G Yeah. 
         
         
        N So they would have got it from the ATO? 
         
         
        G Yeah. 
         
         
        N Boy that's pretty strange. 
         
          
         
        G You might like to think about it I'll give you a call through the week and if we need to get together I'll come down and have a chat. 
         
         
        N Fine. 
         
         
        G OK. 
         
         
        N OK mate. 
         
         
        G Good on you. 
         
         
        N Thanks bye.” 
        
       
       
      Submissions 
       
      
    48 The Crown submits that this conversation (and conversations (e) and (f)) are relevant and admissible for the purposes of ss.55 and 56 Evidence Act 1995. It is part of the Crown case that the Accused is alleged to have fabricated a document entitled “Memorandum of Understanding re the ATO Attitude Towards the Taxation Treatment of Incentive Structures”. This (closely typed nine-and-a-quarter page) document purports to be minutes of a meeting said to have been held on 28 and 29 January 1998 attended by the Accused and Mr Emmanuel Aivaliotes (representing the ATO), Mr Geoff Strong (representing PIC) and Mr Nick Panos (of Coleman & Greig, Solicitors). It is the Crown case that the Accused created the Memorandum of Understanding as part of his concealment in the ATO of his involvement in the PIC group.  
     
      
    49 The Crown submits that Mr Aivaliotes gave evidence at the first trial (T882) that he did not recall that any such meeting took place and was able to account for the few occasions when he met either Mr Strong or Mr Panos. 
     
      
    50 The Crown submits that the Memorandum of Understanding first came to light when Mr Gregory Farr (then the First Assistant Commissioner in charge of Corporate Services) and Mr Stephen Brown (then a Senior Investigator in the Fraud Prevention and Control Unit) were investigating complaints from the public concerning the actions of the Accused and a meeting took place, at the Accused’s Sydney ATO office, on 9 November 1998. In the context of explaining his actions in issuing favourable rulings, the Accused produced a white folder containing a number of documents, including the Memorandum of Understanding (Farr - T1693; Brown - T1722). The Crown submits that the clear inference arising from the production of the document to Mr Farr and Mr Brown is that the Accused represented that there was an accord reached with PIC, at arm’s length, as a result of the Accused being persuaded during the meeting that the PIC schemes were bona fide. 
     
      
    51 In submitting that the present conversation is relevant, the Crown points to the account given by the Accused to Federal Agent Wildman in his interview on 24 March 2000 to the effect that he came across the idea which became PIC, when helping his wife with her master’s degree in human resources and thought that it was a “fantastic business” (see extract at paragraph 39 above). 
     
      
    52 The Crown submits that the subsequent investigation by the Australian Federal Police revealed a non-formatted version of the Memorandum of Understanding document on the hard-disk drive of the Accused located in a storage facility in Fitzroy, Melbourne, leased by him in the name of Christopher Marriott. Details extracted from the computer indicated that the document was created on 19 May 1998, four months after the purported meeting to which the Memorandum of Understanding relates. The Crown acknowledged that expert opinion left open the possibility that the document could have been loaded onto the computer on 19 May 1998 from another source (PT589, 2006). The Crown submitted, however, that the non-formatted version on the hard-disk drive was quite disjointed and had the appearance of a draft and not a simple copying of a pre-existing document (PT606, 2006). 
     
      
    53 Also extracted from the hard-disk drive of the same computer were other documents headed “The Mechanics of the Productivity Incentive Plan”, “Boosting Productivity Through Employee Reward and Ownership Plans”, “Explanatory Memorandum - The Productivity Incentive Trust Plan” and “The Tax Benefits of the Productivity Incentive Trust Plan”. A glossy brochure used for the marketing of PIC products included portions of the text from various parts of these documents (Exhibit C160 at first trial). 
     
      
    54 The Crown submits that a comparison between the contents of these documents, particularly the brochure, and the Memorandum of Understanding in the form of minutes of the alleged meeting on 28 and 29 January 1998, reveals the artificiality of the document in that much of the Memorandum of Understanding is made up of a “cut and paste” of verbatim extracts from the documents found on the computer of the Accused. The Crown alleges that the conclusion from this evidence is that the document is a fabrication, and part of the strategy of the Accused to conceal his involvement with the PIC group and to cover his tracks in relation to his role in issuing the favourable rulings for the PIC schemes. 
     
      
    55 It is the Crown case that the minutes contained within the Memorandum of Understanding are fabricated. The Crown submits that a farcical scenario is suggested by the minutes whereby the PIC scheme, of which the Accused was the creator and of which he had detailed existing knowledge, was explained to him in detail by Mr Strong and Mr Panos, being persons with less knowledge of the PIC scheme than the Accused.  
     
      
    56 The Crown points to a number of items of evidence, none of which (on their own) are decisive on the question, in support of an argument that the present conversation is relevant and admissible in accordance with the test in s.55 Evidence Act 1995. The Crown submits that inferences adverse to the Accused are available, in this respect, from the location of the draft Memorandum of Understanding, in a different order to that contained in the final document, in the Accused’s hard-disk drive in Melbourne, located in a storage facility leased by him in a false name.  
     
      
    57 The Crown submits that an inference adverse to the Accused may be drawn from the similarity between the contents of the Memorandum of Understanding and the brochure prepared with respect to the PIC scheme which was in the possession of the Accused. An inference adverse to the Accused is fortified, the Crown submits, by the circumstances in which the Accused produced the Memorandum of Understanding to Mr Farr and Mr Brown on 9 November 1998. 
     
      
    58 Mr Sutherland SC submits that I should reach the same conclusion as Sully J and hold that conversation (d) is irrelevant and inadmissible. He acknowledged that Sully J had observed, with respect to the Memorandum of Understanding, that “there is, to my eye, something odd about ‘the document’” (Judgment, 14 April 2005, page 28). However, his Honour stated that the issue of admissibility did not turn upon the form and contents of the document, but turned rather “on the capacity of the telephone conversation to bolster a Crown case that there was never such a meeting” as recorded in the Memorandum of Understanding (page 28). His Honour concluded with respect to the present conversation (pages 28-29): 
     
      
       
        
        “I do not see, as at present advised, how the conversation assists that aspect of the Crown case. The most that can be gleaned from the conversation is that Mr Strong is apprehensive that the two given dates are incorrect; and that he has, as matters then stand, no means of clarifying the fact. 
        
       
       
        
        I cannot see anything in the reported material that should be thought reasonably to constitute an admission, whether express or implied, by the accused that the meeting did not in fact take place, and that the document, Exhibit C-2, is simply a charade designed to camouflage some relevant impropriety. 
        
       
       
        
        In my opinion evidence of this conversation is irrelevant and is, therefore, inadmissible.” 
        
       
      
    59 Although acknowledging that I am not bound by the judgment of Sully J, Mr Sutherland SC submits that his Honour’s conclusion was correct and that I should reach the same conclusion on the present application. He submits that the critical question, as identified by Sully J, was whether or not there ever was a meeting of the kind reflected in the Memorandum of Understanding. To the extent that the Crown seeks to establish that the meeting did not occur, because of the suggested inference that the document was created at some time after the events which it purports to record, it was submitted that the telephone conversation did not advance such an argument. Mr Sutherland SC submits that the conversation contains no admission of the document being a fabrication and that the discussion appears to relate to whether the dates of the meeting were correct, not whether a meeting took place at all. 
     
      
    60 Mr Sutherland SC submits that the location of the non-formatted version on the Accused’s hard-disk drive did not assist the Crown on the tender. The evidence did not demonstrate that the non-formatted version was first created on 19 May 1998. It was open to conclude that, although it was loaded onto the Accused’s computer on that date, it had been created well before that date. Further, Mr Sutherland SC submits that there is nothing sinister in the fact that the comments attributed to Mr Strong in the minutes appear to follow closely the content of the PIC brochure - it is to be expected that information of that type would be the source for Mr Strong’s presentation at the meeting. 
     
      
    61 Mr Sutherland SC submits that the conversation does not advance the Crown case at all and is not relevant. In the event that the Court ruled that the conversation was relevant, Mr Sutherland SC advanced a further submission that it should be rejected, in any event, under s.135(a) Evidence Act 1995. 
     
      
       
      Decision 
       
      
    62 I will firstly consider the issue of relevance concerning this conversation. In the event that I hold that it is relevant, I will return later in this judgment to the s.135(a) Evidence Act 1995 objection, which also affects conversation (c) and, if held to be relevant, conversations (e) and (f).  
     
      
    63 As I understand the Crown submission, this conversation is said to be relevant to the question not just whether a meeting occurred at some time between various persons, but whether a meeting took place attended by the nominated persons on the nominated dates at which discussion took place as attributed to various speakers in the alleged minutes contained within the Memorandum of Understanding.  
     
      
    64 It is against that background that the conversation between Mr Strong and the Accused of 2 October 1999 is tendered. Mr Strong rings the Accused to inform him that he had just had a visit from the Australian Federal Police who had enquired about minutes of the meeting and the identity of the person who was present and took them. 
     
      
    65 An examination of the conversation suggests a level of agitation on the Accused’s part with respect to this investigation of the minutes. It is true that the Accused, at one point, says “what’s the big deal here we did have a meeting so who cares”. There is then discussion as to whether the dates were correct. Again, comments by the Accused reflect a level of agitation or concern on his part that an investigation is on foot directed to the minutes of the alleged meeting. 
     
      
    66 I am satisfied that the Accused’s statements in this conversation are at least capable of supporting an inference that the alleged minutes of the meeting were a suspect document and that the fact that an investigation was on foot with respect to them was a cause for concern to the Accused.  
     
      
    67 This reaction of the Accused related to a document about which Sully J observed that there was “something odd”. For the purpose of this ruling, I agree with his Honour’s characterisation of the document. The document has the flavour of a document created after the event. The alleged minutes do not nominate the venue of the meeting or its starting and finishing times. Further, given the facts otherwise known concerning the Accused’s existing detailed knowledge of PIC schemes, there is a strong element of artificiality in the minutes which allege that a detailed and protracted explanation was provided to the Accused, over two days, with respect to information already well known to him. 
     
      
    68 I have come to a different conclusion to Sully J concerning the relevance of the conversation which is presently tendered. I have reached that conclusion only after undertaking my own independent assessment of the material relied upon and the submissions, and after giving careful and significant weight to his Honour’s earlier conclusion. I am satisfied that the statements of the Accused in this conversation are capable of constituting admissions against interest on facts in issue in the proceedings and are capable of reflecting consciousness of guilt on his part concerning the genuineness of the alleged minutes contained in the Memorandum of Understanding.  
     
      
    69 A significant factor in reaching this conclusion is the prima facie unrealistic scenario that, on 28 and 29 January 1998, Mr Strong and Mr Panos would explain in a meeting with the Accused, in considerable detail, the PIC scheme. The fact that the evidence of Mr Aivaliotes is that he has no recollection of such a meeting is also supportive of the admission of this evidence. 
     
      
    70 I am satisfied that this conversation is relevant and admissible for the purposes of ss.55 and 56 Evidence Act 1995. Accordingly, it will be necessary to consider the objection under s.135(a) Evidence Act 1995, a topic to which I will return later in this judgment. 
     
      
       
      Conversation (e) Between the Accused and Nick Panos at 1807 Hours on 3 October 1999 
       
      
    71 The Crown tenders an intercepted telephone conversation between the Accused (“NP”) and Mr Panos (“N”) at 1807 hours on 3 October 1999. Before the first trial, Sully J ruled that this conversation was irrelevant and inadmissible. The Crown tenders it before me for the purposes of the second trial. 
     
      
    72 The conversation in question was as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “NP Hello. 
         
         
        N Hello. 
         
         
        NP Yeah NICK. 
         
         
        N Hello. 
         
         
        NP Hello NICK. 
         
         
        N Hallo hold on a sec Hallo. 
         
         
        NP Yeah NICK it's NICK PETROULIAS. 
         
         
        N Oh how are going mate how are you? 
         
         
        NP Good good you're responded to the missed call did you? 
         
         
        N What was that - 
         
         
        NP You responded to the missed call on the phone? 
         
         
        N That's right yes. 
         
         
        NP Yeah OK listen I made some inquiries about in the those people that turned up at GEOFF'S house. 
         
         
        N Right. 
         
         
        NP And it was an isolated thing that they're that they're investigating which is just ... they're just looking at whether those minutes were real I guess. 
         
         
        N Alright. 
         
          
         
        NP They're just looking they're just looking at the issue of they just issued looking at the issue of the meeting that's it. 
         
         
        N Right OK yeah that's right. 
         
         
        NP And that's why I think that's what explains the fact that it was on Saturday.  
         
         
        N Right. 
         
         
        NP Like some some cop thinking oh what the fuck you know I've got to look at the stupid book piece of crap you know it's not just you know it's not that the whole thing has gone off there. 
         
         
        N Right. 
         
         
        NP So it's it's it's just that issue that only … 
         
         
        N So … 
         
         
        NP So in a way it means you know …

      Submissions 
       
      
    73 In support of the tender of this conversation, the Crown advances the same submissions as relied upon with respect to conversation (d). Mr Sutherland SC advanced the same submissions, resisting the tender, as were made with respect to conversation (d). 
     
      
       
      Decision 
       
      
    74 In rejecting the tender of this conversation, Sully J observed that the conversation was in the same position as conversation (d) and was irrelevant and inadmissible (page 29).  
     
      
    75 In ruling on the tender of this conversation, I repeat the reasons expressed at paragraphs 63 to 69 concerning conversation (d). The conversation takes place a day after the Accused and Mr Strong had discussed the visit to Mr Strong by investigators enquiring about the minutes of the alleged meeting. The Accused informs Mr Panos that he has learned that police were “just looking at whether those minutes were real” and were “looking at the issue of the meeting”. The transcript of the conversation suggests that there is some agitation on the part of the Accused during the conversation, and he suggests to Mr Panos that “there’s nothing to worry about there never was” and “I mean there isn’t anything in substance”. 
     
      
    76 In my view, an inference adverse to the Accused is open from this conversation. He is discussing with Mr Panos the fact that an investigation is under way with respect to the genuineness of the minutes, a topic which arguably would not be of concern to the Accused unless there was a basis for concern about the genuineness of the minutes. The fact that, at one point in the conversation, the Accused makes the statement which is inconsistent with this available inference is not, in my view, a basis for holding that the conversation is irrelevant and inadmissible.  
     
      
    77 I am satisfied that this conversation is relevant and admissible for the purposes of ss.55 and 56 Evidence Act 1995. In these circumstances, it will be necessary to consider the objection under s.135 Evidence Act 1995, a topic to which I will return later in this judgment. 
     
      
       
      Conversation (f) Between the Accused and Geoff Strong at 1104 Hours on 4 October 1999 
       
      
    78 The Crown tenders the intercepted telephone conversation between the Accused (“N”) and Mr Strong (“G”) at 1104 hours on 4 October 1999. Sully J rejected the tender of this conversation before the trial upon the basis that it was irrelevant and inadmissible. The Crown tenders the conversation again for the purpose of the trial to take place before me. 
     
      
    79 The conversation is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “N Hello. 
         
         
        G NICK GEOFF STRONG. 
         
         
        N GEOFF how are you you're in Brisbane? 
         
         
        G Yeah yeah. 
         
         
        N Yeah oh you rang me late last night didn't you? 
         
         
        G Yes I did sorry we're off the road. 
         
         
        N OK. 
         
         
        G I was returning your call. 
         
         
        N Yeah I was returning your call just to say to you I found out a bit more about it I rang GREG FARR from the ATO. 
         
         
        G Yeah. 
         
         
        N And he's saying to me that that part was closed off that aspect of the rule that's the one self contained area the DPP wanted the feds to look at. 
         
         
        G In what way though why? 
         
         
        N I don't know what it will be the charges would possibly be falsifying Commonwealth documents I guess because that's what they've mentioned before which means that those documents are false and not real that meeting never happened and that record thing that record of the thing never happened and then they'll … 
         
         
        G I'm prepared to say that the meeting happened the dates don't gel with my diary. 
         
         
        N Well I don't know I don't know where your diary is and if it exists or not but the point is um the sorry my point is that it's just well that's that's the only basis and um the reason why I think they left it for Saturday morning it's because it's a crappy job that nobody wanted to do. 
         
         
        G They're only young guys that came out. 
         
         
        N Yeah. 
         
         
        G They'd probably be in their you know wouldn't be in their thirties their late twenties. 
         
         
        N Yeah I think they were just interested in just one of those crappy jobs that someone had to do and I mean what are they yeah the only charges that they can claim is yeah that it didn't happen. 
         
         
        G Yeah. 
         
         
        N And that I falsified that document. 
         
         
        G Yeah. 
         
         
        N And that would be an offence in itself it did happen and obviously you've got the record there. 
         
         
        G Yeah. 
         
         
        N I mean you know. 
         
         
        G Well OK they're gonna come back to me sometime next week they also asked NICK PANOS. 
         
         
        N Yeah. 
         
         
        G Because they said to me who was at the meeting and I said look I didn't I can't find ... I definitely had a meeting with NICK PETROULLAS  
        [sic] 
         which I did and I think PANOS was there which he was and there may have been-someone from the ATO but I just can't remember without looking at the document. 
         
         
        N Yeah no it was EMMANUEL yeah the other thing is you did you did you did the minutes and the minutes aren't that exciting all they are is at the beginning the whole spiel which is essentially the brochure you know that brochure?  
         
         
        G Yeah. 
         
         
        N You know that brochure you ... them while they're good it's all that still and then there's that bit at the end about how they want to work together with the ATO. 
         
         
        G Yeah. 
         
         
        N You've got you've got you've got all that haven't you? 
         
          
         
        G I've got it yeah I just got to find it I had a big clean out I'm not exactly sure where it is but I will find it. 
         
         
        N OK. 
         
         
        G Yeah. 
         
         
        N Alright GEOFF ... thank you mate. 
         
        
       
       
        
         
        G I'll talk to you later bye. 
         
         
        N Bye.” 
        
       
      
    80 Sully J rejected the tender of this conversation, concluding that it was irrelevant and inadmissible for the same reasons as applied to conversation (d) (page 29). 
     
      
       
      Submissions 
       
      
    81 In support of the tender, the Crown relies upon the same submissions as made with respect to conversations (d) and (e). Mr Sutherland SC makes the same submissions in opposition to the tender of the conversation.  
     
      
       
      Decision 
       
      
    82 In ruling with respect to this conversation, I repeat the reasons set out at paragraphs 63 to 69 above concerning conversation (d).  
     
      
    83 The present conversation occurs two days after a conversation between the Accused and Mr Strong with respect to the same subject matter. In the present conversation, the Accused explains to Mr Strong that he has obtained information about the investigation which involved investigators considering that “those documents are false and not real that meeting never happened and that record thing that record of the thing never happened”. Mr Strong responds “I’m prepared to say that the meeting happened the dates don’t gel with my diary”.  
     
      
    84 In the course of the discussion, the Accused states that a meeting took place and says to Mr Panos “the other thing is you did you did you did the minutes and the minutes aren’t that exciting all they are is at the beginning the whole spiel which is essentially the brochure you know that brochure … and then there’s that bit at the end about how they want to work together with the ATO”.  
     
      
    85 The Accused then says to Mr Panos “You’ve got you’ve got you’ve got all that haven’t you” to which Mr Strong replies “I’ve got it yeah I just got to find it I had a big clean out I’m not exactly sure where it is but I’ll find it”. 
     
      
    86 For the purpose of this ruling, I am satisfied that an inference adverse to the Accused is open from the discussion concerning the minutes of the meeting involving, at one point, the Accused telling Mr Strong that he (Strong) had done the minutes. The very fact that the topic was being discussed, with apparent concern on the Accused’s part about the accuracy of the dates and the identity of the author of the minutes, is capable of constituting an admission against the Accused’s interest relevant to facts in issue. 
     
      
    87 Accordingly, I am satisfied that this conversation is relevant and admissible for the purposes of ss.55 and 56 Evidence Act 1995. It is now necessary to turn to the second basis for objection under s.135(a) Evidence Act 1995. 
     
      
       
      Objection Under s.135(a)  
      Evidence Act 1995 
       
       
      Submissions 
       
      
    88 Mr Sutherland SC objects to the tender of conversations (c), (d), (e) and (f) upon the basis that, even if their contents are relevant, the probative value of the conversations is substantially outweighed by the danger that the evidence might be unfairly prejudicial to the Accused: s.135(a) Evidence Act 1995.  
     
      
    89 In support of this submission, Mr Sutherland SC submits that unfairness will flow from the decision of the Crown not to call Mr McLaren, Mr Panos or Mr Strong in the Crown case at the trial. Mr Sutherland SC submits that the Crown is in possession of statements signed by Mr Panos and Mr Strong in which they assert that the meeting referred to in the Memorandum of Understanding did, in fact, take place. He submits that the Crown proposes, however, to invite the jury to draw an inference from these telephone conversations (and other evidence) that no such meeting took place.  
     
      
    90 Mr Sutherland SC submits that this is unfairly prejudicial for the purposes of s.135(a) of the Act, in circumstances where the Crown holds statements to the contrary effect from Mr Panos and Mr Strong and declined to call them as witnesses in the prosecution case at the trial. 
     
      
    91 In support of his s.135(a) Evidence Act 1995 submission, Mr Sutherland SC points to authorities which have concluded that unfair prejudice, for the purpose of s.135(a), may arise where evidence is tendered against a party who could not contest it: Commonwealth of Australia v McLean (1996) 41 NSWLR 389 at 401; Gordon (Bankrupt), Official Trustee in Bankruptcy v Pike (No. 1) (Federal Court of Australia, Beaumont J, 1 September 1995). He submits that, in circumstances where the critical issue is whether a meeting took place at which Mr Panos and Mr Strong were present, the clear intention of the Crown to not call those persons as witnesses (where they had said in statements that a meeting had occurred) would militate in favour of an exercise of discretion to exclude evidence of conversations from which a contrary inference will be sought to be drawn. Mr Sutherland SC points also to the evidence of Mr Aivaliotes of having no recollection of attending a meeting with the Accused and a representative of PIC. He submits that, in the light of the evidence of Mr Aivaliotes and the Crown decision not to call either Mr Panos or Mr Strong, it would be unfair to admit the conversations.  
     
      
    92 Mr Sutherland SC submits that similar, but not identical, considerations apply with respect to Mr McLaren. Although Mr McLaren was not said to have been present at the alleged meeting on 28 and 29 January 1998, the Crown says that he was a promoter involved with the Accused in sinister activities, which the Crown wishes to demonstrate by the tender of conversation (c). It was submitted that such an approach was unfairly prejudicial where the Crown declines to call Mr McLaren as a prosecution witness at the trial. 
     
      
    93 The Crown submits that there is no basis for excluding the evidence of these conversations under s.135 Evidence Act 1995. The Crown proposes to rely upon the statements by the Accused in these conversations as admissions reflecting consciousness of guilt (in various ways) on his behalf. The fact that the Crown declines to call Mr Strong, Mr Panos and Mr McLaren as Crown witnesses at the trial, it was submitted, is not relevant to the admissibility of the telephone conversations containing admissions by the Accused which, in some cases, take the form of responses to things said by the other participant in the conversation (PT591.31, 2006).  
     
      
    94 I was informed by the Crown that I can approach this ruling on the basis that it is the Crown’s intention not to call Mr Panos, Mr Strong and Mr McLaren at the forthcoming trial (PT607.56, 2006).  
     
      
       
      Decision 
       
      
    95 It is appropriate, at this point, to refer to an argument advanced by the Accused as a ground for a permanent stay of the indictment for abuse of process, in R v Petroulias (No. 1) at [287]-[302]. The Accused submitted that he was entitled to a permanent stay of the proceedings because of the failure of the Crown to call a number of witnesses at the first trial, principally Mr Panos and Mr Strong. In the course of that argument, I was informed that the Crown had determined not to call Mr Panos and Mr Strong as Crown witnesses because of the telephone conversations with the Accused which are conversations (d), (e) and (f) on the present application. In my judgment R v Petroulias (No. 1), I said at [292]-[296], [300]: 
     
      
       
        
        “292 I was informed by the Crown that Mr Panos and Mr Strong were not called as Crown witnesses because of the existence of evidence obtained by telephone intercepts of collusion with them by the Accused in relation to providing false explanations to any police officer who should approach them about the matter. In support of this submission, I was provided with copies of transcripts of telephone conversations between the Accused and Mr Strong on 2 and 4 October 1999 and between the Accused and Mr Panos on 3 October 1999. These transcripts were Exhibit D1 on the voir dire with respect to Pre-Trial Application No. 3 determined by Sully J on 14 April 2005. His Honour declined to admit the transcripts as evidence in the trial on relevance grounds. In my view, the transcripts disclose discussions between the Accused, Mr Strong and Mr Panos which may be characterised in the manner described in the Crown submission. 
         
         
        293 It was submitted for the Accused before me that the proposition put by the Crown that the telephone intercepts established a basis for not calling Mr Panos and Mr Strong was effectively rejected by Sully J when he ruled on the admissibility of the particular intercepts on 14 April 2005. I do not accept this submission. His Honour ruled that the transcripts were not admissible in the trial of the Accused, applying the relevance test in s.55 Evidence Act 1995. His Honour did not determine that there was an absence of collusion between the Accused, Mr Panos and Mr Strong for the purpose of devising answers to questions to be asked of them by police. The transcripts tend to support that description. 
         
         
        294 I was further informed by the Crown that Mr Panos and Mr Strong did not respond to written requests that they attend for a conference with the Crown representatives. In these circumstances, the Crown concluded that they would not be called in the Crown case at trial. This was the approach foreshadowed in February 2005 to Sully J. 
         
         
        295 The Crown submitted that the question whether Mr Panos and Mr Strong ought be called in the Crown case involved the exercise of prosecutorial discretion. In accordance with the procedures proposed in  
        R v Kneebone 
         [(1999) 47 NSWLR 450] 
         at 460-461 [49]-[52], 462 [60]-[61], the Crown had invited these two persons to attend for a conference to allow an assessment to be made of their veracity and independence. Both persons declined to attend such a conference. Having regard to the information available to the Crown concerning their collusion with the Accused during the investigation, it was determined that they not be called in the Crown case. 
         
         
        296 The Crown submits that it was open to the Accused to call Mr Panos and Mr Strong in his case. Both persons are solicitors and, the Crown submitted, would no doubt be capable of giving coherent evidence in chief so that there was no prejudice by reason of the Accused not being able to cross-examine them. It may be taken, the Crown submitted, that Mr Panos and Mr Strong were articulate and intelligent persons. In these circumstances, there was no unfairness to the Accused.  
         
         
         … 
         
         
        300 I am not satisfied that the Crown’s failure to call Mr Panos and Mr Strong constituted a breach of the prosecutor’s duty to call all material witnesses. The Crown sought to confer with these witnesses in accordance with the practice referred to in  
        R v Kneebone 
        . It may readily be inferred that Mr Panos and Mr Strong were unwilling to attend a conference with the Crown representatives. Their telephone conversations with the Accused in October 1999 were such as to support a view that they were not at arm’s length from the Accused. There is nothing to indicate that these persons were not available to be called by the Accused in his case at the trial if he so wished. I see no basis for the grant of a stay arising from the Crown’s failure to call Mr Panos and Mr Strong at the first trial.” 
        
       
      
    96 Although I was dealing with an application made for a different purpose, the observations made concerning the Crown’s approach to the calling of Mr Panos and Mr Strong are presently relevant. 
     
      
    97 Sully J’s rulings, on 14 April 2005, excluding conversations (d), (e) and (f), were confined solely to the relevance ground. The application of s.135 Evidence Act 1995 played no part in his Honour’s reasoning. 
     
      
    98 In approaching the s.135(a) objection, it is appropriate to keep in mind that the Crown tenders these conversations as admissions by the Accused. The fact that the statements of the Accused were made in the course of conversations with Mr McLaren, Mr Strong and Mr Panos does not mean that, in some way, the Crown is seeking to adduce evidence from those three persons.  
     
      
    99 As I observed in my judgment in R v Petroulias (No. 1) at [296], it is open, in any event, to the Accused to call these persons in his case if he so wishes. I do not consider that the fact that the Crown is said to have statements from Mr Panos and Mr Strong which assert that a meeting took place creates a situation of unfair prejudice with respect to the tender of the conversations, let alone unfair prejudice that substantially outweighs the probative value of the admissions made by the Accused during the conversations.  
     
      
    100 The conversations will be admitted to establish, expressly and by implication, admissions against interest by the Accused which, the Crown contends, are indicative of consciousness of guilt. 
     
      
    101 I do not consider that the circumstance of the Crown declining to call Mr McLaren, Mr Panos or Mr Strong as prosecution witnesses or to, in some way, seek to place before the jury the statements of Mr Panos and Mr Strong concerning the alleged meeting, establishes a basis for the exercise of the s.135(a) discretion.  
     
      
    102 There is a further matter which bears upon the issue of unfair prejudice. Some comments made by Mr Panos and Mr Strong in the conversations are open to a construction that a meeting did take place, albeit with queries as to the date or dates of the meeting. As Mr Sutherland SC acknowledged, there was a “two-edged sword aspect” to his submission on this point (PT602, 2006). I mention this because it is difficult to see how the failure of the Crown to call Mr Panos and Mr Strong gives rise to unfair prejudice to the Accused when, to some extent at least, some things said by them in these conversations may assist the Accused. As I have said, it remains open to the Accused to call these persons at the trial if he sees fit. 
     
      
    103 I am not satisfied that the probative value of conversations (c), (d), (e) and (f) is substantially outweighed by the danger that the evidence might be unfairly prejudicial to the Accused resulting from the fact that the Crown does not propose to call Mr McLaren, Mr Panos or Mr Strong at the trial. 
     
      
       
      Conclusion 
       
      
    104 Accordingly, I am satisfied that each of the six conversations which are tendered by the Crown are relevant and admissible for the purposes of ss.55 and 56 Evidence Act 1995, and that no basis has been demonstrated for the exercise of discretion to exclude any of the conversations under s.135(a) of that Act. 
     
      
    105 I propose that each of the six conversations will be admitted into evidence at the trial.

    IN THE SUPREME COURTOF NEW SOUTH WALESEQUITY DIVISIONBRERETON JTuesday 30 January 20075415/06 Ajan Khanna v Commissioner of Police for NSW 
     
      
    JUDGMENT 
     
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: The plaintiff Ajan Khanna was, on 9 July 2004, in the County Court of Victoria, convicted of an offence against (VIC) Crimes Act 1958, s 47(1), of committing on or about 21 April 1998, an indecent act with a child under the age of 16, and sentenced to a term of imprisonment for 12 months, which was wholly suspended for 18 months. The defendant Commissioner of Police for New South Wales contends that Mr Khanna is a registrable person whose name and other particulars must be entered on the Child Protection Register maintained under the (NSW) Child Protection (Offenders Registration) Act 2000 (“the NSW Registration Act”). Mr Khanna claims a declaration that he is not a registrable person, and an injunction restraining the Commissioner from making any entry in respect of him in the Register. 
     
      
    Background 
     
      
    2 In October 2002, Mr Khanna was charged with an offence under (VIC) Crimes Act 1958, s 45(1), of taking part in an act of sexual penetration with a child under the age of 16, and later with an alternative count under s 47(1) of committing an indecent act with a child under the age of 16. The incident to which the charges related occurred on or about 21 April 1998, when Mr Khanna was aged 24 and the child was aged seven. Mr Khanna pleaded not guilty. After a five day trial, which commenced on 5 July 2004, in the County Court of Victoria at Melbourne before Nixon CCJ and a jury of 12, he was acquitted of the charge under s 45, but found guilty of the alternative count under s 47, the conduct alleged against him in this respect involving the touching of the child’s vaginal area, without penetration. 3 Mr Khanna was sentenced to a term of imprisonment for 12 months, wholly suspended for 18 months. The sentence did not require Mr Khanna to be under the supervision of any supervising authority or any other person, and he was not required to enter into any bond. The sentencing judge refused the prosecution’s application for a Buccal swab, saying: 
     
      
       
        
        I am prepared to accept that this was an isolated lapse … . I think one can never be sure, but I think he is unlikely to reoffend in this manner. Therefore, given all the circumstances, I don’t believe it’s appropriate to make such an order. 
        
       
      
    4 Mr Khanna has no other convictions. The sentencing judge accepted that his prospects of rehabilitation were very good, given his previous good character and the other evidence before the court, and that the offence was “an isolated lapse”. 
     
      
    5 Although the evidence is not entirely clear, Mr Khanna seems always to have been a resident of New South Wales, and was in Victoria for a few days only at the time of the offence. 6 The (VIC) Sex Offenders Registration Act 2004 (“the Victorian Registration Act”) requires certain offenders who commit sexual offences to keep police informed of their whereabouts, and prevents registered sex offenders working in child-related employment. Mr Khanna has not been entered on the Child Protection Register in Victoria, and it is common ground that, at least until recently, he is not a registrable person in Victoria. An officer of the Victorian Director of Public Prosecutions has indicated to Mr Khanna’s representatives that it is not proposed to seek to have him placed on the Victorian register. 
     
      
    7 The NSW Registration Act imposes requirements and obligations relating to reporting and registration for persons who have committed sexual and other serious offences against children. On Friday 16 June 2006, New South Wales Police contacted Mr Khanna with a request that he complete a Form 3 Notice under the NSW Registration Act, which is a step in the registration process. Mr Khanna’s solicitors have requested that the NSW Police reconsider their position, but on 9 October 2006 the police indicated that they intended to proceed with steps towards registration. Mr Khanna instituted these proceedings on 23 October 2006, and when it became apparent that the police were not prepared to await the determination of the proceedings, moved ex parte on 24 October 2006 for an interlocutory injunction. On that day, upon Mr Khanna by his counsel giving to the court the usual undertaking as to damages, it was ordered that until 31 October 2006 the Commissioner be restrained from making any entry in the register in respect of Mr Khanna. The proceedings were stood over to 31 October 2006, on which date I heard them on a final basis, extending the interlocutory injunction until judgment. 
     
      
    8 Two issues arise: 
     
      
    · Is Mr Khanna, as the Commissioner contends, a “registrable person” for the purposes of the NSW Registration Act?  
     
      
    · If not, should the relief sought nonetheless be declined on discretionary grounds, as the Commissioner submits? 
     
      
    Is Mr Khanna a “registrable person”? 
     
      
    9 The Register is established by s 19 of the NSW Registration Act, which provides as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        Child Protection Register 
         
         
        (1) The Commissioner of Police is to establish and maintain a Child Protection Register or arrange with another person or body for the establishment and maintenance of a Child Protection Register on the Commissioner’s behalf. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) The Register is to contain the following information in respect of each registrable person (to the extent that it is known by the Commissioner of Police): 
        
       
       
        
        (a) the person’s name and other identifying particulars, 
        
       
       
        
        (b) details of each Class 1 or Class 2 offence of which the person has been found guilty or with which the person has been charged, 
        
       
       
        
        (c) details of each offence of which the person has been found guilty that resulted in the making of a child protection registration order, 
        
       
       
        
        (d) the date on which the person was sentenced for any registrable offence, 
         
         
        (e) the date on which the person ceased to be in government custody in respect of a registrable offence, or entered or ceased to be in government custody in respect of any offence during the person’s reporting period, 
        
       
       
        
        (f) whether the person is a child or has any special need or disability, 
        
       
       
        
        (g) any information provided to the Commissioner in respect of the person under this Part, 
        
       
       
        
        (h) any information the Commissioner considers appropriate for inclusion in the Register, 
        
       
       
        
        (i) any other information prescribed by the regulations. 
        
       
      
    10 Reporting obligations are imposed on a “registrable person” in respect of a “registrable offence”, beginning from the later of when the person is sentenced for the offence or when the person ceases to be in government custody in relation to the offence [s 14], and continuing for eight years (if the person has only ever been found guilty of a single “class 2 offence”), or longer in other cases [s 14A]. The reporting obligations include reporting the person’s “relevant personal information” to the Commissioner within 28 days after the later of ceasing to be in government custody or being sentenced for the registrable offence, or (if the person enters NSW from a “foreign jurisdiction”) within 14 days after entering and remaining for 14 or more consecutive days, or (if the person is a “corresponding registrable person”, within 28 days after becoming a corresponding registrable person [s 9A]. A registrable person must then report the person’s relevant personal information to the Commissioner each year.  
     
      
    11 Who is a “registrable person” is defined in the NSW Registration Act by s 3A, as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        3A Registrable persons 
         
         
        (1) A registrable person is a person whom a court has at any time (whether before, on or after the commencement of this section) sentenced in respect of a registrable offence, and includes a corresponding registrable person. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) Unless a person is a corresponding registrable person, a person is not a registrable person merely because the person: 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        (b) is a person on whom a sentence has been imposed in respect of a single Class 2 offence, if the sentence did not include: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (i) a term of imprisonment, including a term of imprisonment the subject of a periodic detention order or home detention order, or an equivalent order under the laws of a foreign jurisdiction, or 
           
           
          (ii) a requirement that the person be under the supervision of a supervising authority or any other person or body, …  
          
         
        
       
      
    12 The Commissioner concedes that Mr Khanna is not a “corresponding registrable person” within s 3C. That concession is correctly made. Section 3C provides:  
     
      
       
        
        A corresponding registrable person is a person who: 
        
       
       
        
        (a) had at any time (whether before, on or after the commencement of this section) been in a foreign jurisdiction and at that time had been required to report to the corresponding registrar in that jurisdiction for a longer period than the person would have been required to report under this Act, and 
        
       
       
        
        (b) would, if the person were currently in that jurisdiction, be required to report to the corresponding registrar in that jurisdiction for a longer period (the corresponding foreign reporting period) than the person would be required to report under this Act, and 
        
       
       
        
        (c) falls within a class of person whom the regulations prescribe as corresponding registrable persons for the purposes of this Act. 
        
       
      
    13 The three requirements of s 3C are each linked by the word “and”, and are therefore cumulative, so that all three have to be satisfied if a person is to be a “corresponding registrable person”. Mr Khanna does not satisfy requirement (a). As a result of recent statutory amendments in Victoria, he might now satisfy (b) and (c), but without element (a) that is insufficient to make him a “corresponding registrable person”. 
     
      
    14 As “court” includes a court of a foreign jurisdiction, and “foreign jurisdiction” means a jurisdiction other than New South Wales [s 3(1)], the County Court of Victoria is a relevant court. 15 A “class 2 offence” is defined to mean, inter alia: 
     
      
       
        
        (a) an offence that involves an act of indecency against or in respect of a child, being an offence that is punishable by imprisonment for 12 months or more or 
        
       
       
        
        …  
        
       
       
        
        (j) any offence under a law of a foreign jurisdiction that, if it had been committed in NSW, would have constituted an offence of a kind listed in this definition. 
        
       
      
    16 Had the offence of which Mr Khanna was convicted been committed in NSW, it would have been an offence against (NSW) Crimes Act 1900, s 61N(1), which provides that “any person who commits an act of indecency with or towards a person under the age of 16 years … is liable to imprisonment for two years”. Accordingly, his offence was a “class 2 offence”. 
     
      
    17 Mr Khanna is therefore within s 3A(1), in that he is a person whom a court has sentenced in respect of a registrable offence, unless he is excluded by s 3A(2)(b). The only sentence imposed on him was one in respect of a single class 2 offence. The essential issue is whether that sentence was one that included a term of imprisonment, for the purposes of s 3A(2)(b)(i), or a requirement that he be under supervision within 3A(2)(b)(ii). 18 Is the Victorian suspended sentence imposed on Mr Khanna a “term of imprisonment” for the purposes of s 3A(2)(b) the NSW Registration Act? This requires identification of what is contemplated by “term of imprisonment” in the NSW Registration Act, and then consideration of whether the Victorian suspended sentence falls within that concept.  
     
      
    19 If s 3A(2)(b)(i) spoke simply of “a sentence of imprisonment”, and not a sentence including “a term of imprisonment” which is then specifically stated to include “a term of imprisonment the subject of a periodic detention order or home detention order” (or their equivalents in other jurisdictions), the position would be unambiguous: there is not room for doubt that a suspended sentence of imprisonment is, generally speaking, to be regarded as a sentence of imprisonment. In Drake v Minister for Immigration & Ethnic Affairs (1979) 46 FLR 409, the plaintiff had been convicted of possessing cannabis and was sentenced to imprisonment for 12 months, accompanied by a direction that he be released after three months on entering into a recognizance of $200 to be of good behaviour for two years. The Minister issued a deportation order against him on the ground, authorised by (CTH) Migration Act 1958, s 12, as it then was, that he had been “convicted in Australia of any … offence for which he has been sentenced to imprisonment for one year or longer”. Bowen CJ and Deane J held that the deportation order was authorised, and that s 12 was concerned with the sentence imposed, not the term of imprisonment actually served. Their Honours said (at 418): 
     
      
       
        
        It is unfortunate that the liability of a person to be made the subject of a deportation order with all its consequences should depend upon verbal niceties of the type involved in the present matter. There is, indeed, much to be said for the view that a finding that the plaintiff was, for the purposes of s 12 of the Migration Act, sentenced to a term of imprisonment of one year involves a preference for the shadow of verbalism over the substance of reality. In our view, however, this is not so. The fact that the learned magistrate directed that the plaintiff be entitled to be released upon recognizance after he had served three months in prison does not alter the fact that the magistrate determined that the appropriate sentence to be imposed for the offence of which the plaintiff was guilty was a term of imprisonment of one year. The magistrate in fact imposed that sentence of imprisonment. True it is that, by entering into a recognizance and undertaking obligations which, if breached, would render him liable to be sentenced to a new term of imprisonment, the plaintiff was entitled to secure his release after he had served three months of the term imposed and that, on such release, his liability to serve the balance of the term imposed was extinguished. None the less, in our view, the plaintiff was, under the composite sentence imposed, sentenced to a term of imprisonment of one year. We are unable to read the relevant words of s 12 in a sense which would warrant the conclusion that their requirements were not satisfied by the sentence which was imposed upon the plaintiff. 
        
       
      
    20 In dissent, Smithers J construed s 12 as referring to a sentence of one year’s imprisonment simpliciter, namely a sentence which by its terms requires the person sentenced to serve one year at least in imprisonment. In Meng Kok Te v Minister for Immigration & Ethnic Affairs (1999) 88 FCR 264, the Full Federal Court considered and rejected a submission that Drake was wrongly decided. Their Honours were strongly influenced by the circumstance that after the decision in Drake, the former section was replaced by a very similar section, so that Parliament should be taken to have intended the words to bear the meaning that they had already had judicially attributed to them. In respect of what is now Migration Act, s 201(c), their Honours observed that the section refers to the sentence of imprisonment imposed, not the term of imprisonment actually served; that it directs attention not merely to the sentence imposed but to the quality of the offence committed as reflected in the sentence imposed; that, a fortiori Drake, it was not plain in Meng Kok Te that the applicant would necessarily serve less than 12 months; and that on the appellant’s argument, it would be necessary for the Minister to defer for some time after a suspended sentence had been imposed determination of whether the offender fell within s 201(c).21 However, in the NSW Registration Act, the circumstance that the provision specifically addresses custodial sentences falling short of full-time imprisonment suggests that Parliament did not contemplate that the phrase “a term of imprisonment” in this context of itself encapsulated sentences of less than full-time custody. While an alternative explanation is that the specific reference to periodic detention and home detention might have been included for more abundant caution, then it remains striking, particularly when one considers the sentencing hierarchy applicable in New South Wales, that there is no corresponding specific reference to a suspended sentence. In (NSW) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (“the Sentencing Procedure Act”), Part 2 deals with custodial sentences in Division 2: imprisonment (s 5), periodic detention (s 6), and home detention (s 7). It then deals with “non-custodial alternatives” in Division 3: community service orders (s 8), good behaviour bonds (s 9), conditional discharge or dismissal (s 10), deferred sentence (s 11) and suspended sentences (s 12). Thus a suspended sentence under New South Wales sentencing legislation is regarded as a “non-custodial alternative”. In Regina v LRS [2001] NSWCCA 338, Sully J (at [65]) said: 
     
      
       
        
        If there had been a proper consideration of those alternatives then, as I understand the scheme of the Act, it necessarily followed that a sentence of imprisonment must be passed. I do not mean passed and served in full time custody. I mean passed. That done, it was then necessary to consider, and to decide, whether service of the sentence thus passed should be: (a) suspended pursuant to s12; (b) service by means of home detention pursuant to s7; (c) service by means of periodic detention pursuant to s6; or, (d) service in full time custody. 
        
       
      
    22 In Regina v Zamagias [2002] NSWCCA 17, Howie J (with whom Hodgson JA and Levine J agreed) said (at [29]): 
     
      
       
        
        So in the second step, where, for example, the term chosen is one of 18 months or less the alternatives generally available would be, in escalating order of severity: an order suspending the sentence; a home detention order; a periodic detention order; full-time custody:  
        R v LRS  
        [2001] NSWCCA 338 per Sully J at [65]. Of course the court has a discretion as to which of the available alternatives is chosen, but that discretion must be exercised according to established sentencing principles. 
        
       
      
    23 It is clear that a suspended sentence is lower in the sentencing hierarchy than a term of imprisonment the subject of a periodic detention order or a home detention order, which are the two alternatives specifically referred to in s 3A(2)(b)(i).24 Moreover, Part 4 of the Sentencing Procedure Act does not apply to a sentence of imprisonment which is suspended, except to the extent to which it deals with setting the non-parole period and the balance of the term of the sentence [s 12(3)]. One significant relevant consequence of this is that s 63 (which otherwise requires an offender’s identifying particulars to be taken, including photographs and fingerprints), does not apply in the case of a suspended sentence. In the event of a breach of a good behaviour bond in connection with a suspended sentence, the court must generally revoke the bond [s 98]. If it does so, the order of suspension ceases to have effect and Part 4 applies - except to the extent to which it has already applied in relation to setting a non-parole period - and the sentence “takes effect” [s 99(1)(c)]; the court may direct at that stage that the sentence be served by periodic detention or home detention [s 99]. In other words, a sentence of imprisonment does not “take effect” while suspended.25 The NSW Registration Act includes provisions that require notice to be given to registrable persons of their reporting obligations. First, notices are to be given by the sentencing court when a registrable person is sentenced for a registrable offence, as soon as practicable after being sentenced, to the person of the reporting obligations, and to the Commissioner and the supervising authority of the fact that the registrable person has been sentenced [s 4]. Next, notices are to be given when a registrable person commences to serve a supervised sentence [s 5], as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        5 Notices to be given when registrable person commences supervised sentence for registrable offence 
         
         
        (1) As soon as practicable after a registrable person commences a supervised sentence for a registrable offence, the supervising authority for the person is to give written notice to the person of:  
         
         
        (a) the person’s reporting obligations, and 
         
         
        (b) the consequences that may arise if the person fails to comply with those obligations. 
         
         
        (2) The regulations may make provision for or with respect to the manner and form in which written notice must be given under this section. 
         
         
        (3) In this section,  
        supervised sentence 
         means:  
         
         
        (a) a sentence of imprisonment the subject of a periodic detention order or home detention order, or 
         
         
        (b) a community service order, or 
         
         
        (c) a good behaviour bond under which the person is required to submit to strict supervision, or 
         
         
        (d) an order of detention under section 27 or 39 of the  
        Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990 
        , other than an order that, as originally made, requires the person to be kept in strict government custody. 
        
       
      
    26 Thirdly, notices are to be given when a registrable person ceases to be in custody or under supervision of a supervising authority, as follows [s 6]: 
     
      
       
        
        6 Notices to be given when registrable person ceases to be in custody or under supervision of supervising authority 
         
         
        (1) As soon as practicable before or after a registrable person:  
         
         
        (a) ceases to be in strict government custody, or 
         
         
        (b) ceases to be in government custody, or 
         
         
        (c) ceases to be subject to a supervised sentence (within the meaning of section 5), or 
         
         
        (d) ceases to participate in the Pre-Trial Diversion of Offenders Program under the Pre-Trial Diversion of Offenders Act 1985, or 
         
         
        (e) ceases to be subject to a condition of parole requiring the person to be subject to supervision, or 
         
         
        (f) ceases to be an existing licensee, 
         
         
         whether in respect of a registrable offence or otherwise, the supervising authority for the person is to give written notice of that fact to the Commissioner of Police. 
         
         
        (2) As soon as practicable before or after a registrable person who has been in government custody for 14 or more consecutive days ceases to be in government custody, whether in respect of a registrable offence or otherwise, the supervising authority for the person is to give written notice to the person of:  
         
         
        (a) the person’s reporting obligations, and 
         
         
        (b) the consequences that may arise if the person fails to comply with those obligations. 
         
         
        (3) The regulations may make provision for or with respect to the manner and form in which written notice must be given under this section. 
        
       
      
    27 From these provisions, it appears that a sentence of imprisonment which is suspended is not a “supervised sentence”, unless accompanied by a bond under which the person is required to submit to strict supervision; and that as a suspended sentence of imprisonment does not “take effect”, a person who receives such a sentence does not “commence” the sentence for the purposes of s 5(1).28 The matters to which reference has been made raise sufficient doubt as to whether, for the purposes of s 3A(2)(b) of the NSW Registration Act, a sentence is to be taken to include a term of imprisonment if it is wholly suspended to justify consideration of extrinsic material which can assist in the ascertainment of the meaning of the provision, including the relevant Second Reading Speech [(NSW) Interpretation Act 1987, s 34(1)(b)(i), (2)(f)].  
     
      
    29 Upon the second reading of the Child Protection (Offenders Registration) Bill, the Minister (the Hon Carmel Tebbutt, Minister for Juvenile Justice, Minister Assisting the Premier on Youth, and Minister Assisting the Minister for the Environment) said [NSW Legislative Council Hansard, 20 June 2000, p 7055]: 
     
      
       
        
        The Bill will also exclude first-time class 2 offenders who receive a fine or unsupervised good behaviour bond. As these offenders are less serious than class 1 offenders, there is no demonstration of actual recidivism, and the court is satisfied that such offenders are not of sufficient risk to the community to warrant any supervision after sentencing. 
        
       
      
    30 Although the Minister referred specifically to the exclusion of offenders who receive only “a fine or unsupervised good behaviour bond”, the policy which informed that exclusion was the view that such sentences were demonstrative that a court was satisfied that the offender was not of sufficient risk “to warrant any supervision after sentencing”. An unsupervised suspended sentence conveys the same view. There are many similarities between a suspended sentence and an unsupervised good behaviour bond, the significant difference being that, in the case of a good behaviour bond, the possibility of a sentence of imprisonment is deferred; whereas in the case of a suspended sentence of imprisonment, the sentence is imposed but its execution suspended so that it does not “take effect”. The concept of “supervision after sentencing” in the Minister’s speech reflects that of a “supervised sentence” in s 5.31 In distinction from the Migration Act provisions considered in Drake v Minister and in Meng Kok Te, in each of which the relevant statutory provisions spoke of “sentenced to imprisonment for a period of not less than one year”, or “for one year or longer”, in the NSW Registration Act s 3A(2)(b) speaks of a sentence which includes “a term of imprisonment”, not merely of a “sentence of imprisonment”. I do not think that this distinction is merely semantic, although it is not critical to my conclusion that under New South Wales sentencing law, a person who receives a suspended sentence of imprisonment receives a sentence of imprisonment, but so long as it remains suspended and therefore does not take effect, the sentence does not include a term of imprisonment for the purposes of s 3A(2)(b). That conclusion is primarily founded on the following matters: 
     
      
    · The delineation in s 3A(2)(b)(i) of the (NSW) Child Protection (Offenders Registration) Act 2000 of the types of sentence which disqualify a person from the exception from registration otherwise granted by that section as including terms of imprisonment the subject of a periodic detention order or home detention order (which are custodial sentences under the Sentencing Procedure Act), without stipulating a term of imprisonment the execution of which is suspended (which is a non-custodial alternative under that Act);· The place of a suspended sentence in the sentencing hierarchy in New South Wales, as reflected in the Sentencing Procedure Act – below terms of imprisonment the subject of a periodic detention order or home detention order; 
     
      
    · The policy indicators in the Second Reading Speech that the significant matter informing the distinction between sentences which lead to registration and those which do not was whether the sentence was of a type which indicated a judgment by the court that the offender did not require further supervision;  
     
      
    · The circumstance that a suspended sentence is not a supervised sentence under s 5(3) of the NSW Registration Act, coupled with the circumstance that a person who receives a suspended sentence of imprisonment never “commences a supervised sentence” for the purposes of s 5(1) unless it takes effect (because of the non-applicability of Part 4 so long as it remains suspended). 
     
      
    32 The nature of a suspended sentence, and the circumstance that a suspended sentence is not a “supervised sentence”, indicate that Parliament did not intend a sentence of imprisonment that was wholly suspended to be excluded from the exemption granted by s 3A(2)(b)(i). The reference in s 3A(2)(b)(i) to “a term of imprisonment, including a term of imprisonment the subject of a periodic detention or home detention order”, was not intended to include a term of imprisonment which was wholly suspended, but was limited to a “custodial sentence” within Part 2, Div 2 of the Sentencing Procedure Act.  
     
      
    33 How does a Victorian suspended sentence relate to this concept? (VIC) Sentencing Act 1991, s 27, provides as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        27. Suspended sentence of imprisonment 
         
         
        (1) On sentencing an offender to a term of imprisonment a court may make an order suspending, for a period specified by the court, the whole or a part of the sentence if it is satisfied that it is desirable to do so in the circumstances. 
         
         
        … 
         
         
        (2A) The period for which the whole or a part of a sentence of imprisonment may be suspended is- 
         
         
        (a) the length of the suspended term of imprisonment; or 
         
         
        (b) another period specified by the court not exceeding 3 years, in the case of the Supreme Court or the County Court, … 
         
         
        whichever is the longer. 
         
         
        (3) A court must not impose a suspended sentence of imprisonment unless the sentence of imprisonment, if unsuspended, would be appropriate in the circumstances having regard to the provisions of this Act. 
         
         
        (4) A court proposing to make an order suspending a sentence of imprisonment must before making the order explain, or cause to be explained, to the offender in language likely to be readily understood by him or her- 
         
         
        (a) the purpose and effect of the proposed order; and 
         
         
        (b) the consequences that may follow if he or she commits, whether in or outside Victoria, another offence punishable by imprisonment during the operational period of the sentence. 
         
         
        (5) A wholly suspended sentence of imprisonment must be taken to be a sentence of imprisonment for the purposes of all enactments except any enactment providing for disqualification for, or loss of, office or the forfeiture or suspension of pensions or other benefits. 
         
         
        … 
        
       
       
        
        29. Effect of suspended sentence 
         
         
        An offender in respect of whom a suspended sentence has been imposed under section 27 only has to serve the sentence or part sentence held in suspense if he or she is ordered to do so under section 31. 
        
       
       
        
        31. Breach of order suspending sentence 
         
         
        (1) If at any time during the operational period of a suspended sentence of imprisonment, the offender commits, whether in or outside Victoria, another offence punishable by imprisonment, the offender is guilty of an offence for which he or she may be proceeded against on a charge filed by a prescribed person or a member of a prescribed class of persons. 
         
         
        (2) A proceeding for an offence under sub-section (1) may be commenced at any time up until 3 years after the date on which the offence is alleged to have been committed. 
         
         
        … 
         
         
        (4) Despite anything to the contrary in this or any other Act or in any rule of law, the Supreme Court or the County Court may, if the suspended sentence was imposed by it, hear and determine without a jury an offence against sub-section (1) and, subject to any rules of court, the practice and procedure applicable in the Magistrates' Court to the hearing and determination of summary offences applies so far as is appropriate to the hearing of the offence. 
         
         
        (5) If on the hearing of a charge under sub-section (1) the court finds the offender guilty of the offence, it may impose a level 10 fine and in addition must - 
         
         
        (a) restore the sentence or part sentence held in suspense and order the offender to serve it; or 
         
         
        (b) restore part of the sentence or part sentence held in suspense and order the offender to serve it; or 
         
         
        (c) in the case of a wholly suspended sentence, extend the period of the order suspending the sentence to a date not later than 12 months after the date of the order under this sub-section; or 
         
         
        (d) make no order with respect to the suspended sentence. 
         
         
        (5A) Despite anything to the contrary in sub-section (5), if on the hearing of a charge the court finds the offender guilty of the offence it must, in addition to any fine it may impose under sub-section (5), exercise the power referred to in paragraph (a) of that sub-section unless it is of the opinion that it would be unjust to do so in view of any exceptional circumstances which have arisen since the order suspending the sentence was made. 
         
         
        … 
         
         
        (6) If a court orders an offender to serve a term of imprisonment that had been held in suspense, the term must be served- 
         
         
        (a) immediately; and 
         
         
        (b) unless the court otherwise orders, cumulatively on any other term of imprisonment previously imposed on the offender by that or any other court. 
        
       
      
    34 Thus unlike a New South Wales suspended sentence, in which the order suspending the sentence is accompanied by a requirement that the offender enter into a good behaviour bond [Sentencing Procedure Act, s 12], a Victorian suspended sentence does not involve entry into a good behaviour bond; but the practical effect and consequences are otherwise not substantially different. Like a New South Wales suspended sentence, a Victorian suspended sentence is not a “custodial sentence” within the contemplation of the New South Wales sentencing legislation; it is a sentence of a type which does not include what s 3A(2)(b)(i) of the NSW Registration Act contemplates to be a term of imprisonment. 35 The answer is not provided by (VIC) Sentencing Act, s 27(5). In Meng Kok Te, the Full Federal Court said that in considering the proper construction of Migration Act, s 201(c), it was appropriate to take account of the terms of s 27(8) of the Sentencing Act (VIC), which made provision similar to s 27(5) in respect of a sentence that was partly as distinct from wholly suspended: 
     
      
       
        
        This sub-section provides that a partly suspended sentence of imprisonment must be taken for all purposes to be sentence of imprisonment for the whole term stated by the court. The proper construction of Commonwealth legislation cannot be determined by a State enactment unless the Commonwealth law incorporates by reference the provisions of the State legislation. Nonetheless, parliament must have contemplated that s 201(c) of the  
        Migration Act 
         would apply to offenders whose sentences are imposed by State courts under State law. In the absence of clear words indicating a contrary intention, it would be strange if s 201(c) of the  
        Migration Act 
         did not apply to an offender who, under State law, is taken “for all purposes” to have been sentenced to imprisonment for a term of not less than 12 months. 
        
       
      
    36 In the present context, the proper construction and application of a New South Wales statute cannot be determined by a Victorian statute. While the New South Wales Parliament would have contemplated that the NSW Registration Act would apply to offenders whose sentences were imposed by the courts of other States under the laws of other States, the words of s 3A(2)(b) direct attention to the precise types of sentence involved, and the issue is whether the Victorian suspended sentence falls within the terms of s 3A(2)(b). That issue cannot be determined by (VIC) Sentencing Act, s 27(5). 37 Nor did the sentence imposed on Mr Khanna include a requirement that he be under supervision, for the purposes of s 3A(2)(b)(ii) of the NSW Registration Act. A person upon whom a suspended sentence of imprisonment has been imposed under (VIC) Sentencing Act, s 27, is not under supervision of a supervising authority or any other person or body [DPP v Neisser [2006] VSC 218].  
     
      
    38 Accordingly, for the purposes of s 3A(2)(b)(i) of the NSW Registration Act, the sentence imposed on Mr Khanna did not include a term of imprisonment. Nor, for the purposes of s 3A(2)(b)(ii) did it include a requirement that he be under supervision. It follows that, he is a person on whom a sentence has been imposed in respect of a single class 2 offence, and neither of the two matters that might deprive him of that exemption from registrability applies. In my opinion, therefore, he is not a registrable person. 
     
      
    Should relief be refused on discretionary grounds? 
     
      
    39 The Commissioner submitted that relief should be refused on discretionary grounds because, although until 10 October 2006 Mr Khanna was not a registrable person under the Victorian Act - since he was not an “existing controlled registrable offender” - that position changed with effect from 10 October 2006. 
     
      
    40 The Victorian Act in its original form provided: 
     
      
       
        
        6. Who is a registrable offender? 
         
         
        (1) Subject to sub-sections (3) to (6), a registrable offender is a person whom a court has at any time (whether before, on or after 1 October 2004) sentenced for a registrable offence. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        (3) Unless he or she is a registrable offender because of sub-section (2), a person is not a registrable offender merely because he or she- 
         
         
        … 
         
         
        (c) is a person on whom a sentence has been imposed in respect of a single Class 2 offence, if the sentence did not include- 
         
         
          
          (i) a term of imprisonment; or 
          
         
         
          
          (ii) a requirement that the person be under the supervision of a supervising authority or any other person or body. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (4) Unless he or she is a registrable offender because of sub-section (2) or is an existing controlled registrable offender, a person is not a registrable offender merely because he or she was sentenced for a registrable offence before 1 October 2004. 
        
       
      
    41 It will be observed that in the Victorian Registration Act, s 6(3)(c)(i) does not include the additional specific references to periodic detention and home detention which appear in the corresponding provision of the NSW Act and which were important to the construction which I have preferred. Given the potentially broader concept of “a term of imprisonment” in the Victorian Act, Mr Khanna might not have been saved from registrability in Victoria by sub-s 3(c); but unless he was an existing controlled registrable offender, he was not registrable by reason of sub-s (4), as he was sentenced before 1 October 2004, namely on 9 July 2004.  
     
      
    42 “Existing controlled registrable offender” was then defined to mean “a person who, as a result of having been sentenced for a registrable offence, was under the supervision of a supervising authority or any other person or body immediately before 1 October 2004”. A person serving a Victorian suspended sentence was not relevantly under supervision and was not an “existing controlled registrable offender” under that definition [DPP v Neisser]. 
     
      
    43 However, with effect from 10 October 2006, the definition of “existing controlled registrable offender” in the Victorian Registration Act has been amended to include: 
     
      
       
        
        A person who, as a result of having been sentenced for a registrable offence committed when he or she was 18 years of age or older, was immediately before 1 October 2004. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        (d) serving a sentence referred to in Section 6C(1) of the  
        Corrections Act 
         1986 … 
        
       
      
    44 (VIC) Corrections Act 1986, s 6C(1)(d) refers to “a person who is serving a sentence of imprisonment that was wholly or partly suspended and who is in the community in accordance with that sentence”. Immediately before 1 October 2004, Mr Khanna was serving such a sentence. He is therefore within the definition, now, of “existing controlled registrable offender” within the meaning of the Victorian Act.  
     
      
    45 However, Mr Khanna will not incur reporting obligations in Victoria unless and until he enters and remains in Victoria for fourteen days [Victorian Registration Act, s 12]. Only then would he become a “corresponding registrable person” for the purposes of the NSW Act, because so far as the evidence goes he has not been required to report to the corresponding registrar in Victoria at any time when he has been in Victoria [NSW Registration Act, s 3C(a)]. There is no suggestion that he has been in Victoria since 10 October 2006. And as element (a) is not satisfied, it matters not that he would if currently in Victoria be required to report [s 3C(b)], nor that he now falls within the class of “registrable offenders” within the Victorian Act and is therefore in a prescribed class for the purposes of the NSW Registration Act [s 3C(c); (NSW) Child Protection (Offenders Registration) Regulations 2001, Clause 5B(d)], because the requirements of the definition of “corresponding registrable person” are cumulative [see [13] above]. 
     
      
    46 Mr Khanna is therefore not presently a “corresponding registrable person”, and he will become one only if he travels to Victoria and remains there for fourteen days, so as to incur reporting obligations there. I do not see why the hypothetical possibility that in such circumstances he would become a “corresponding registrable person”, and thus registrable in New South Wales, as a result of retroactive amendments to the Victorian legislation, particularly when there is no reason to suppose that Mr Khanna will go to Victoria so as to incur reporting obligations there, should lead this court to decline as a matter of discretion to recognise and give effect to the fact that he is not registrable in the present circumstances in New South Wales. 
     
      
    Conclusion 
     
      
    47 The Child Protection (Offenders Registration) Act 2000 serves an important function in protecting the community from the risk of children being exposed to persons who have committed sexual offences against children. However, most protections of one class of person involve incursions on the liberties of others, and this Act endeavours to balance the goal of the protection of children with the rehabilitation of offenders after they have served their sentences by recognising that some classes of sex offenders do not pose a sufficient risk to justify the imposition on them of the stigma of registration to the detriment of their effective rehabilitation. The terms of the Act and the second reading speech indicate that in balancing those considerations Parliament has determined that a single offence in the less serious category (Class 2) that attracts a sentence indicative of a judgment that supervision after sentencing is not required is not such as to warrant registration. 48 A suspended sentence unaccompanied by a bond requiring strict supervision is such a sentence. So is a suspended sentence under the Victorian Sentencing Act. The reference in s 3A(2)(b)(i) to “a term of imprisonment, including a term of imprisonment the subject of a periodic detention or home detention order”, was not intended to include a term of imprisonment which was wholly suspended, but was limited to a “custodial sentence” within Part 2, Div 2 of the Sentencing Procedure Act. 49 Accordingly, for the purposes of s 3A(2)(b)(i) of the NSW Registration Act, the sentence imposed on Mr Khanna did not include a term of imprisonment. Nor, for the purposes of s 3A(2)(b)(ii) did it include a requirement that he be under supervision. It follows that he is a person on whom a sentence has been imposed only in respect of a single class 2 offence, and neither of the two matters that might deprive him of that exemption from registrability applies. He is therefore not a registrable person. The circumstance that as a result of a recent retroactive legislative amendment in Victoria Mr Khanna might become a corresponding registrable person in New South Wales if he ever goes to Victoria is no reason to decline to recognise and give effect to his current status under New South Wales law. 
     
      
    50 My orders are: 
     
      
      
      1. Declare that upon the proper construction of the (NSW)  
      Child Protection (Offenders Registration) Act 
       2000 and in the events which have happened, the plaintiff Ajan Khanna is not a “registrable person” for the purposes of that Act. 
       
       
      2. Order that the defendant Commissioner of Police for New South Wales be restrained from by himself his servants or agents making any entry in the Child Protection Register kept under s 19 of that Act in respect of the plaintiff. 
       
       
      3. Order that the defendant pay the plaintiff’s costs.

    JUDGMENTIntroduction1 This is an application by Phillip Abbruzzese (the Applicant) for leave to withdraw pleas of guilty he entered upon arraignment in respect of two charges arising from frauds upon the Commonwealth of Australia. The parties agree that this occurred on the 25th July 2005.2 There is also before me, in separate proceedings, an application by the Applicant’s wife, Violetta Kostadinoska, who wishes to withdraw her pleas of guilty in respect of two of a number of charges upon which she has been presented arising generally from the same facts and circumstances. She is separately represented. Her application has been listed contemporaneously with that of this Applicant as the proceedings have continued. However, such connections as there are between the Applicant and his wife in these prosecutions do not impact upon the decision I am called upon to make in this present matter.3 The application is before the Court, upon its remission from the Court of Criminal Appeal to be dealt with according to law, following the successful Crown appeal from the orders of his Honour Judge Freeman on the 13th April 2006 when his Honour entered pleas of not guilty on behalf of the Applicant: Regina v Phillip Abbruzzese [2006] NSWCCA 207. 4 There has been some confusion as to the indictment in respect of which the application has been brought. I propose to deal with this at the outset in these introductory remarks.5 In the Court of Criminal Appeal, Grove J, with whom Hidden and Kirby JJ agreed, noted the history of the proceedings to the date of the appeal. His Honour referred to charges to which the Applicant pleaded guilty in the Local Court, from which he later resiled before Blanch CJDC who then fixed a date for trial. 6 His Honour noted that advice was subsequently given to the Director of Public Prosecutions that the Applicant would be entering pleas of guilty, thereby reverting to his original position, and thereafter the matter was listed before Berman DCJ and then Puckeridge DCJ for sentence proceedings. 7 His Honour raised questions as to precisely when the Applicant was arraigned, however at paragraph [26], by a process of deduction from terms of written submissions and the oral argument of counsel, his Honour concluded that it was common ground that arraignment did in fact take place, and that it took place at some point prior to the 13th April 2006. His Honour noted that the copy of the indictment included in the appeal book was signed but undated and the back unendorsed. 8 It was common ground between the parties before me that the relevant arraignment occurred on the 25 July 2005 before his Honour Judge Berman S.C.9 Unfortunately, when the matter was adjourned after the presentation of the evidence upon which the parties wished to rely in this Court, I was left with the impression that there had been some change made to the indictment upon which the Applicant had been presented, by the replacement of the initial series of charges with a single count. 10 This impression was taken from the nature of the copies of the indictment placed before the court. One of those has the date 4 February 2005 on its face, whereas the back sheet shows the date of the plea as the 25 July 2004 before his Honour Judge Berman S.C. Moreover, the plea recorded on the back sheet is expressed as “2 x G” notwithstanding that there was only one charge set out on the document. There is no signature on this copy. The affidavit of Robert Ian Davidson, solicitor for the Applicant, of the 18th August 2006 filed in these proceedings has as annexure A, a document described as the proposed indictment. This copy of an indictment also contains only one charge, expressed to be a further charge in different terms to those used in the first. This document is signed. 11 Upon comparison of these documents it became apparent that they are each partial copies of the one indictment. I have since been provided with access to the original document which discloses that the Applicant was charged with two offences, the first contrary to section 29D of the Crimes Act, 1914 (Cth) and the other contrary to section 135.1(5) of the Criminal Code, 1995. 12 The first count is expressed in the following terms: 
     
      
      Between about 5 February 1998 and about 10 May 2001 at Sydney did defraud the Commonwealth, namely the Commonwealth Services Delivery Agency, in that he dishonestly obtained Disability Support Pension which was not payable because he was in receipt of income in the name Filippo Spano and his partner, Violet Stoikovska, was in receipt of income in the name of Violet Adrevska. 
      
    13 Beneath this charge there are 11 paragraphs of particulars upon which the Crown relies for this charge, wherein are summarised the receipt of income by the Applicant and his partner from various employers, the receipt of compensation payments, and the receipt of rental income from real estate.14 The second count is expressed in the following terms: 
     
      
      Between about 24 May 2001 and about 19 December 2002 at Sydney did dishonestly cause a loss to another person, namely the Commonwealth entity the Commonwealth Services Delivery Agency, knowing that such a loss would occur, in that he did obtain payment of Disability Support Pension in the name Philip Abbruzzese without disclosing to the Commonwealth that he was in receipt of income in the name Filippo Spano, and his partner, Violet Stoikovska, was in receipt of income in the name of Violet Andrevska. 
      
    15 Beneath this charge there are 4 paragraphs of particulars upon which the Crown relies for this charge, wherein are summarised the receipt of income by the Applicant and his partner from employers, the receipt of compensation payments, and the receipt of rental income from real estate.16 It is the pleas of guilty entered to these charges with which the court is concerned.The Evidence17 The Application came on for hearing before me on the 15th September 2006. Affidavits filed in support of the application are from Ian Robert Davidson of the 18th August 2006, and from the Applicant of the 23rd August 2006. On behalf of the Respondent Crown, affidavits by Wendy Patricia Firth of the 22nd August 2006 and the 15th September 2006 were filed. The earlier of these has as annexures A and B, affidavits by Ms Firth of the 16th February 2006 and the 15th March 2006.18 The Applicant gave evidence and was cross-examined.19 Exhibit A is a report by Emma Collins, psychologist, of the 12th September 2005 and Exhibit B is a report by Dr. Jonathan M Carne, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist, of the 3rd November 2005. These were tendered by the Respondent Crown.The Issue20 The submissions of counsel on behalf of the Applicant were, in essence, that by reason of his state of mental health, to be ascertained from the reports of the aforementioned practitioners and his evidence to this court, the Applicant was unusually sensitive to the pressures brought by the proceedings against him and their possible outcome, to the extent that he could not properly assimilate the advice of his representatives from time to time regarding his options. It was said that the Applicant’s mental health left him so susceptible to the effects of the anxiety generated by the prosecution and the advice he was receiving, that he was unable to make a properly informed decision as to whether he should plead guilty or not guilty to the charges. 21 Counsel expressly disavowed any suggestion that there was improper pressure brought by the solicitors or counsel who have acted for the Applicant throughout these proceedings. Rather, it was by reason of the suggested sensitivity and susceptibility that the integrity of these pleas was brought into question. 22 Counsel submitted that the Applicant‘s vulnerability was such that his pleas of guilty could not be seen to be a free and voluntary confession to these charges, or attributable to a genuine consciousness of his guilt. 23 Counsel acknowledged that there must be good and substantial reasons before the Applicant should be permitted to withdraw his pleas, but submitted that these were present in this matter.24 The Crown has challenged these propositions.The History of the Proceedings25 The assessment of the Applicant’s vulnerability, or susceptibility, and whether these pleas of guilty lacked the integrity required before the court ought to act upon them, will be informed by reference to the history of these proceedings.26 The Applicant appeared before a magistrate in the Downing Centre Local Court on the 31st March 2004. He was represented by counsel, who was appearing upon instructions from the Applicant’s solicitors. Pleas of guilty were entered to the charges and he was committed to the District Court on the 16th April 2004 for sentence.27 On that day Blanch CJDC adjourned the proceedings to the 11th June 2004 when the Applicant appeared before her Honour Judge Tupman. A medical certificate was tendered speaking to the birth of a child to the Applicant’s partner, and the proceedings were adjourned to the 9th July 2004 for mention to set a date for sentence.28 On the 9th July 2004 the matter was adjourned for sentence to the 26th August 2004. On that date it was noted that a pre-sentence report had not been prepared for the Applicant and his Honour Judge Graham adjourned the proceedings to the 28th October 2004 for sentence. 29 The Applicant continued to be represented by the same counsel and solicitors.30 By letter of the 13th September 2004 the Director of Public Prosecutions received a letter from the solicitors advising that they ceased to act for the Applicant. A Notice of Ceasing to Act was filed.31 On the 28th October 2004 the Applicant appeared before his Honour Judge O’Reilly represented by a solicitor. He informed the court that his instructions were not consistent with the pleas of guilty and he was given leave to withdraw from the matter. 32 The proceedings were adjourned to the 19th November 2004 and on this date his Honour the Chief Judge adjourned the proceedings to the 17th December 2004 for mention and to set a date for sentence proceedings. The Applicant was represented by the Legal Aid Commission on this occasion.33 On the 17th December 2004 the Applicant was again represented before his Honour the Chief Judge, and the proceedings were adjourned to the 21st January 2005 for mention and to set as date for the sentence proceedings.34 On the 21st January 2005 the Applicant adhered to his pleas of guilty and the proceedings were adjourned to the 31st March 2005 for sentence, however on that date the Applicant reversed his pleas and the matter was adjourned for mention on the 4th February 2005 to set a trial date. On that date the trial was set down for hearing over five weeks to commence on the 18th July 2005. This date was later vacated and the trial listed to commence on the 25th July 2005.35 On the 20th July 2005 the Director of Public Prosecutions received a letter from solicitors acting for the Applicant advising that he would be entering pleas of guilty to both offences on the 25th July 2005. On that date the Applicant appeared before his Honour Judge Berman S.C. represented by counsel with a solicitor instructing him.36 I do not have a transcript of those proceedings, but as I have noted earlier in these reasons, it is common ground that the Applicant pleaded guilty on this occasion, and there is an endorsement to that effect on the back sheet of the indictment, a copy of which was before me.37 His Honour adjourned the proceedings from that date to the 27th July 2005 for mention. The pleas of guilty were confirmed and the proceedings adjourned to the 30th September 2005 for sentence. 38 On that date the matter was mentioned before his Honour Judge Puckeridge Q.C. The Applicant was once against represented by counsel. An adjournment was sought so that the Applicant might be assessed by a psychiatrist. The Crown tendered material upon which it intended to rely, and the proceedings were adjourned to the 4th November 2005 part heard.39 On the 4th November 2005 the Applicant appeared with his counsel, however he advised the court that the Applicant would traverse his plea if he were called to give evidence, and sought leave to withdraw. 40 A transcript of these proceedings has been included in the material before me. These record representations by the Applicant after his counsel departed. The Applicant told his Honour that he wanted the matter adjourned again so that he could obtain further legal representation. He wanted to get a private solicitor. He complained of the seizure by the authorities of his property and money. He told the court that he only pleaded guilty to finish the case and that he had done nothing wrong. At page 2 the Applicant is attributed with the following: 
     
      
      Your Honour I only plead (sic) guilty to finish the case because there’s nothing done wrong. I just want to end it, like I said I’ve got seven kids and it stop, they’ve sold two properties off me. They got $100,000 cash in the bank, no-one tells me where the money is, no-one tells me how much I have got to give them, but the solicitor tell me you got to plead guilty, you can’t pay because you admitting you’re working. Of course I’m admitting I’m working, I’m not denying it. 
        
      
    41 He told the court that he did not want the Legal Aid Commission to represent him, for reasons given at line 41 on page 2: 
     
      
      Because I say to them not guilty and they say to me ‘no you have to plead guilty, I can’t represent you otherwise.’ This is the honest truth. 
      
    42 He told the court that he wanted a private solicitor, that there were funds available to pay a private solicitor but they were being held by the authorities, and he understood that there were two aspects of the proceedings. This appears at page 3 line 20: 
     
      
      …there’s two cases here they’re saying, one is for the criminal matter I think what I understood and after today or whatever I have to go for a civil – and all the solicitors there they say to me ‘I don’t understand why they done this to you’, but no-one wants to tell me what’s happening. 
      
    43 At the conclusion of the exchange his Honour indicated that the court could not accept the pleas of guilty and stood the matter over until the 30th November 2005. On that date a solicitor from the Legal Aid Commission appeared to inform the court that the matter was yet to be allocated. The matter was adjourned to the 21st February 2006 for the hearing of an application to withdraw the pleas of guilty.44 On the 1st February 2006 the Director of Public Prosecutions received a letter from the Legal Aid Commission advising that they were no longer instructed in the matter and no longer had authority to act for the Applicant.45 On the 21st February 2006 the Applicant informed the court of the name of the solicitor he was intending to instruct to act for him. A letter was received by the Director of Public Prosecutions on the 6th March 2006 from that solicitor confirming that his firm was not instructed to appear on behalf of the Applicant.46 On the 13th April 2006 the Applicant appeared unrepresented before his Honour Judge Freeman. I have a transcript of those proceedings. It is annexure C to the affidavit of Ms Firth of the 22nd August 2006 and annexure D to the affidavit of Mr. Davidson of the 18th August 2006.47 The Applicant told his Honour that he pleaded guilty to these charges in 2004 and 2005 because he wanted to finish the case. He said it had been going on for too long, he is a schizophrenia (sic); he has seven children, some of whom were in and out of hospital over the last month with seizures. He complained of his most recent solicitors telling him that if he wanted to plead not guilty he would need to find somebody else to represent him. He continued at page 2: 
     
      
      Now how can I plead guilty or not guilty when the prosecution – I don’t know if it’s up to them but somebody has to tell me the law and somebody needs to tell me how much money I owe them and how much money they have to give me back because they’ve got nearly one million dollars off me your Honour. They sold the house. On the paperwork it says anything that I’m supposed to have in my possession before ’93 is not supposed to be touched and they sold the flat on me. How can I plead guilty. 
      
    48 The matter stood in the list, and when called later his Honour once again raised the earlier pleas and asked the Applicant why he should be permitted to plead not guilty. The Applicant responded at page 6: 
     
      
      Because I am not guilty your Honour. I’m not guilty and no solicitor wants to represent me like that. Why? Aren’t solicitors supposed to do what I tell them to do? If I say I’m not guilty they have to represent me not guilty. They can’t say to me because you don’t want to do what – we want you to plead guilty, I have to plead guilty. How can I do that? They’ve been telling to do this. I’ve never said, not guilty or guilty. They’ve been telling me all to do this but nobody ask me any question what happened, how it happened, why did you do it or what did you do. They haven’t asked me, not one person your Honour. The only question they told me, we’ve gone through your transcript and you have to plead guilty otherwise you’re going to get a bigger sentence if you plead not guilty. But in the meanwhile this has been nearly six years now. I’ve been in the street with the five little children. 
      
    49 His Honour noted that there was no formal application before the court for the pleas to be withdrawn, and the exchanges continued thereafter. At page 13 he asked the Applicant whether he understood what a plea of guilty meant, to which he responded: 
     
      
      Yes. I – to have an explanation with it, what about if I done a mistake. I’m not guilty your Honour. 
      
    50 The transcript at page 14 provides further illumination upon the Applicant’s understanding of matters. 
     
      
      HIS HONOUR: Did you understand Mr Abbruzzese that the Commonwealth were saying that you had received a disability support pension between 1998 and 2001 when you were not entitled to it? You understand that the Commonwealth says you received a pension and you were not entitled, did you understand that? 
       
      OFFENDER: I was entitled to it. I am entitled to it. This is the point your Honour. 
       
      HIS HONOUR: The Commonwealth says you were not entitled to it because you were receiving payments which disqualified you. 
       
      OFFENDER: That’s wrong your Honour. You are allowed to go to work. You can earn $10,000 a year on the pension and at the end of the year you do your tax return and I’ve been doing all that. I’ve been doing all that. I’ve got proof of all that stuff. 
       
      HIS HONOUR: You understand these are the elements of the charge which the Crown has brought? 
       
      OFFENDER: Yes. 
       
      HIS HONOUR: Were these explained to you at the time you entered your plea of guilty or not? 
       
      OFFENDER: No, no your Honour. 
       
      HIS HONOUR: Were you not told that that was the charge, that you’d received a disability pension when you were not entitled to it? 
       
      OFFENDER: No I think they told me it was just fraud the charge. 
       
      HIS HONOUR: You understood, did you not, or was it explained to you that the allegation was that you received a disability pension when you were not entitled to it? 
       
      OFFENDER: Yes. 
       
      HIS HONOUR: You understood that? 
       
      OFFENDER: Yes. 
       
      HIS HONOUR: That was explained to you? 
       
      OFFENDER: Yes. 
       
      HIS HONOUR: Did you understand and was it explained to you that the reason the Commonwealth said you were not entitled to the pension was because you were receiving other moneys which disqualified you from receiving the pension, namely that you were being paid under another name for working and that your wife was receiving money as well. 
       
      OFFENDER: Yeah but we’re separated. She’s entitled to receive it. This is a big mistake your Honour. This a big mistake and this is why I – I cannot plead guilty to it when I’m entitled— 
       
      HIS HONOUR: Well how did you plead guilty to it? 
       
      OFFENDER: Because of the – 
       
      HIS HONOUR: Twice. 
       
      OFFENDER: The solicitors your Honour they’ve been pushing me. You have to plead guilty because you get lesser but nobody ask me what’s the story. They all gone off the transcript. Not one solicitor he ask me what’s your story. And they themself told me I can’t represent you. I didn’t say to them not to represent me. But they only want to represent me only if I plead guilty. How can that be? 
      
    51 Thereafter his Honour expressed the view upon what the Applicant had said to him, albeit not by way of evidence, that the allegation that he was not given advice because he was not asked or allowed to fully instruct his lawyers meant that the application could not realistically be refused. The exchanges continued, and at page 17 his Honour suggested that in the circumstances it was impossible for the Applicant to represent himself in the inquiry that would be required before he should be permitted to withdraw his plea. His Honour therefore took the step of entering a plea of not guilty on the accused’s behalf, noting that the plea of guilty entered earlier had been rejected by his Honour Judge Puckeridge Q.C.52 I note that the transcript records his Honour speaking of the plea in the singular, whereas there were two charges to which the Applicant has pleaded guilty on two separate occasions.53 The Court of Criminal Appeal held that this approach by his Honour was an error. The essential criticism was that his Honour entered pleas of not guilty on behalf of the Applicant upon the representations by the Applicant from the bar table, without requiring the Applicant to formally withdraw his pleas and offer evidence as to the facts upon which the court should have considered whether he ought to be permitted to do so.The Medical Opinion54 In the light of events that evolved after I reserved my judgement, to which I will refer in due course, it is appropriate that I consider in some detail the contents of the reports Exhibit A and Exhibit B respectively. Neither the psychologist Ms Collins, nor the psychiatrist Dr. Carne was required for cross-examination.55 The Applicant was seen by Ms Collins for seventy-five minutes on the 8th September 2005. She noted that the Applicant was born on the 28th May 1966. He is now 40 years of age.56 Ms Collins noted that although he was generally cooperative throughout the assessment, he was agitated and distressed and it was not considered appropriate to administer psychometric testing. She said that he was also vague in his self-report. 57 I note that Ms Collins had access to a pre-sentence report and to his criminal history. Neither of those documents is before me.58 Ms Collins recorded a tragic history. The Applicant was born in Sydney of Italian parents who relocated back to their homeland when he was but months of age. His siblings, four older brothers and one elder sister, were all killed in a motor vehicle collision when the Applicant was aged three years. His Uncle was driving at the time, and he and the Applicant were the only survivors from the vehicle.59 This loss, as one might expect, had a devastating impact. It is said that his father became schizophrenic, but it is not said that this was a sequelae to the grief suffered from his loss, and no connection apart from the temporal link to the event is discussed. The Applicant reports that his father had numerous admissions and was managed on anti-psychotic medication. According to the history, his father would scream at him, threaten his mother, or exhibit delusional behaviour, and on occasions both as a child and an adult the Applicant would be called upon to intervene prevent his father causing harm to his mother. These incidents included an occasion when his father attempted to stab his mother. 60 The Applicant’s father died in 2004 from a heart attack, after having battled his mental illness throughout his life. 61 There were attempts to have the Applicant submit to assessment for the same condition, but he resisted these because of his experiences watching the treatment of his father over the years. 62 The family moved from Italy to Belgium, and then returned to Italy before returning to Australia in 1978 leaving the Applicant behind. He re-joined them in Sydney in 1982. He would have then been 16 years of age. He attended school in year 10, and was awarded a school certificate notwithstanding that in his assessment he was not entitled to it. He left school and worked as a tiler up until 1991. There is reference in the report to his release from gaol, after which he engaged in mostly short-term work. 63 He has been married twice, and has six children from these unions at the time of the report. From the first marriage he has a twenty-year-old son and a nineteen-year-old daughter. Contact with them has been intermittent due to his escalating drug use.64 His present marriage has produced three sons and a daughter. They are aged from one year to five years of age as at the date of the report. 65 The Applicant suffers from Hepatitis C virus contracted through intravenous drug use. He has continuing pain from a back and leg injury suffered at work in 1997. 66 When in gaol he has been prescribed anti-psychotic medication but his belief is that it exacerbated his symptoms. Of these Ms Collins writes: 
     
      
      … Mr. Abbruzzese reports that when he is feeling distressed, he hears voices that he likened to an angel and a devil. He said that these voices monitor his behaviour and often give him their opinion as to whether his behaviour is appropriate (“don’t do that”, “do this” etc). He also tells me that he sees what he reported to be antennae-like aerials at the top of his peripheral vision that are often stuck on walls or buildings. He states that these look like video recording devices that have been placed onto surfaces to capture information. Mr. Abbruzzese also said that he sees these when he is feeling ‘bad’. Additionally, he reports that he is often suspicious of the motives of others and feels that there are people ‘out there’ that want to cause him ill will. When asked as to whether he thought these paranoid thoughts, auditory hallucinations and perceptual disturbances were troublesome, Mr. Abbruzzese tells me that he believes such occurrences are normal and he reported believing that everyone has these experiences. 
      
    67 The Applicant reported sustained abuse of drugs, including cocaine and heroin. He has since then been maintained on methadone. He is a regular user of cannabis. 68 As noted above, no formal cognitive assessment was performed due to the agitated state of the Applicant. Upon the observations made of him in the course of the interview and the history he gave however, it is thought that his cognitive ability falls within the low average to average range.69 Ms Collins’ assessment of the Applicant’s personality, against the restless and agitated presentation, and the tendency to digress from the topic being discussed, was that he presented with mild delusions of persecution, and perceptual disturbance that encompasses both auditory and visual hallucinations. These indicated psychiatric illness, and when this was indicated to him he agreed to see a psychiatrist.70 In her concluding remarks Ms Collins wrote: 
     
      
      It is evident that Mr. Abbruzzese has a genetic vulnerability with regard to developing schizophrenia…It is possible that his substance abuse may have exacerbated his perceptual and delusional behaviour, and his ongoing abuse of cannabis remains of concern. Whilst the offences were not directly discussed with him, Mr. Abbruzzese’s psychiatric presentation would likely have impacted upon his judgement and ability to exercise appropriate self-restraint. He currently impresses with symptoms that could be consistent with schizophrenia or perhaps an Axis11 presentation such as shizotypal personality disorder.  
      
    71 Dr. Carne saw the Applicant on the 2nd November 2005. He gleaned a somewhat briefer history from the Applicant, albeit in terms consistent with that attributed to him by Ms Collins.72 Of his psychiatric history Dr. Carne notes: 
     
      
      Mr. Abbruzzese described persecutory delusions, that he is being followed, auditory and visual hallucinations of a persecutory, contradictory and confusing nature and command auditory hallucinations. He described these present particularly when he is affected by cocaine but also when not drug-affected, on and off since the age of fourteen. 
      
    73 With regard to the offences with which he is charged he is attributed with the following: 
     
      
      …Mr. Abbruzzese told me that he had pleaded guilty to get the matter over with but had not committed any offence. 
       
      He told me that after having left gaol he found he was unable to obtain work because of the criminal record associated with his name of Abbruzzese, so he started using his mother’s name, Spano. He told me he did start work but was injured and put in a Workers Compensation claim and then took part in a return to work programme with the full knowledge of the Commonwealth Employment Service and the GIO. He denied intentionally committing any offence during this period. 
       
      Mr. Abbruzzese told me that in relation to allegations that he did not notify the Department of Social Security that he was married at times when he should have done so, that his marriage was turbulent and there were separations and then reunions. He told me that he in fact did declare those to the Department of Social Security. 
       
      Mr. Abbruzzese also told me that he thought he had notified the Department of Social Security of the ownership of property or properties which were also the subject of some of the charges. 
       
      Mr. Abbruzzese told me that the only work he undertook when in receipt of a pension was work undertaken as far as he was aware within the limits permitted by the pension. 
      
    74 The findings upon psychiatric examination are expressed thus: 
     
      
      His emotions were labile during the interview, at times angry and often sobbing when talking about his difficulties. 
       
      He repeatedly and adamantly asserted that he was innocent of the offences but that he was not being believed. He claimed that he was being victimised and that charges were being laid against him because of his past criminal record and that because he had been identified as a ‘junkie’. 
       
      In spite of his distress there was no evidence of formal thought disorder or of abnormalities or perception of belief, that is, no evidence of acute psychosis at the time of the interview. 
       
      Mr. Abbruzzese told me that he had $100,000 in a bank account currently frozen by the authorities, sufficient to repay the alleged Social Security overpayment and he told me that he was prepared to do so. 
      
    75 Dr. Carne ultimately came to the view that on the balance of probability the Applicant’s primary problem is a severe personality disorder with borderline and schizotypal features and significant substance/drug dependence. It is possible that he has schizophrenia, although in the doctor’s opinion this is less likely.76 The dates upon which the Applicant was assessed by Ms Collins and Dr. Carne were the 8th September 2005 and the 2nd November 2005 respectively. The sequence of events in which they took place was as follows:(1) 31st March 2004 – appearance in the Local Court – plea of guilty entered;(2). 16th April 2004 – appearance before Blanch CJDC;(3) 11th June 2004 – appearance before Tupman DCJ;(4) 9th July 2004 – appearance in the District Court;(5) 26th July 2004 – appearance before Graham DCJ;(6) 13th September 2004 – letter from Applicant’s solicitors advising the DPP of their ceasing to act;(7) 28th October 2004 – appearance before O’Reilly DCJ – solicitor appearing advised the court that his instructions were inconsistent with a plea of guilty and was given leave to withdraw;(8) 9 th November 2004 – appearance before Blanch CJDC;(9) 17th December 2004 – appearance before Blanch CJDC;(10) 21st January 2005 – appearance in the District Court – the Applicant adhered to his pleas of guilty – adjourned for sentence;(11) 31st March 2005 – appearance in the District Court – pleas reversed – adjourned for mention and to set trial date;(12) 4th February 2005 – appearance in the District Court – trial date set for 18th July 2005 – 5 weeks estimate – trial subsequently re-listed to the 25th July 2005;(13) 20th July 2005 – letter from solicitors for the Applicant advising the DPP of intention to plead guilty;(14) 25th July 2005 – appearance before Berman DCJ – arraignment – pleas of guilty;(15) 27th July 2005 – appearance in the District Court – pleas of guilty confirmed;(16) 8th September 2005 – consultation with psychologist Emma J Collins – reported on the 12th September 2005;(17) 30th September 2005 – appearance before Puckeridge DCJ – material upon which the Crown intended to rely tendered – adjourned to allow psychiatric assessment;(18) 2nd November 2005 – consultation with Dr. Jonathan M Carne, psychiatrist – reported on the 3rd November 2005;(19) 4th November 2005 – appearance before Puckeridge DCJ – court advised by counsel that the Applicant would traverse his pleas if called to give evidence – given leave to withdraw – his Honour indicated he could not accept the pleas in the circumstances;(20) 30th November 2005 - appearance in the District Court – matter yet to be allocated by Legal Aid – adjourned to 21st February 2006 for hearing of an application to withdraw pleas of guilty;(21) 1st February 2006 – Legal Aid Commission advised the DPP that they no longer acted;(22) 21st February 2006 – appearance in the District Court – unrepresented – the Applicant gave the name of a solicitor who was to represent him;(23) 6th March 2006 – letter from solicitor nominated by Applicant advising the DPP that they did not act;(24) 13th April 2006 – appearance before Freeman DCJ – pleas of not guilty entered on behalf of the Applicant;(25) 6th July 2006 – judgement of the Court of Criminal Appeal.77 Thus, the Applicant pleaded guilty to these charges at committal, and adhered to those pleas until well after the proceedings were in the District Court for the sentence proceedings. He was, properly, permitted to withdraw his pleas and his matter was listed for trial. Within days of his trial he reverted to his original position, and pleaded guilty upon arraignment even though at that time he could have proceeded to trial should he have wished to do so. He again changed his position, after the psychiatric consultation on the 2nd November 2005. This was well after the commencement of the prosecution.The Applicant’s Evidence78 The Applicant did little more than embrace the terms of his affidavit when he was examined in chief. In that document he asserts that he is not guilty of the offences charged, acknowledges that he has been previously represented by a number of solicitors and counsel who have all advised that the case against him is a strong one, and that he should plead guilty thereby to have the benefit of the discount to which he is entitled. He claims that he has told all of them that he is not guilty and that he wants to proceed to trial. Every lawyer has told him, he asserts, that it is impossible to successfully defend the charges and they will not be able to do so.79 He asserts that he pleaded guilty in the past, not because he believes he is guilty, but because of the pressure and the advice of his lawyers that they cannot defend him.80 I note once more that counsel appearing for the Applicant disavowed any reliance upon any suggestion that there was inappropriate pressure brought to bear upon the Applicant to have him plead guilty to these charges.81 The Applicant confirmed that he is presently medicated with Valium, which he had not taken for two days preceding this hearing, and was on methadone, but had not taken any of that drug during the preceding seven days.82 When cross-examined the Applicant maintained that he was not guilty, and that he pleaded guilty only because of the advice he was given. He did not deny, indeed he accepted the history of the proceedings in which he pleaded guilty before a magistrate, reversed that position in the District Court, but then on the day when he could have had his trial chose to plead guilty to the charges presented by way of the indictment.83 In the course of the cross-examination I noted that the Applicant became emotional and agitated, and presented in a manner well fitting the description given to him by Ms Collins and Dr. Carne.Subsequent Events84 Before turning to the principles and their application to the facts relevant to this question, I shall refer to events, which followed the 15th September 2006 when I reserved my judgement to be delivered on the 29th September 2006.85 When the court convened on that date I was informed that the Applicant had the night before been taken into care as a result of a domestic disturbance at his home, and was presently being assessed at a mental health facility. The matter was therefore adjourned to the 3rd October 2006 so that further information could be provided, and for further evidence to be led should it have been the wish of the Applicant to do so. On that date there was still no information to assist the court with regard to the Applicant’s state of health and I made orders to allow for the Applicant’s bail to continue with conditions to facilitate his assessment and treatment as required, and for the preparation of a report or such other evidence that the Applicant might wish to offer upon his application.86 Eventually, on the 12th December 2006, the Applicant’s solicitor appeared on his behalf and tendered a discharge summary from the Prince of Wales Intensive Care Unit, in respect of the Applicant’s admission on the 15th October 2006 and discharge on the 16th October 2006, together with a photocopy of his file from the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital to which he was taken on the 29th September 2006, and from which he was transferred to the Rozelle mental health facility on the 1st October 2006 until his discharge on the 5th October 2006.87 This material became Exhibit 1 on the voir dire. The Crown objected to the tender of this material as irrelevant to the question of whether the Applicant should be permitted to withdraw his pleas of guilty, to be determined according to the facts and circumstances as they were at the time when the pleas were entered. I was reminded of the decision of Wong v DPP (2005) 155 A Crim R 37 in which the relevant principles were summarised by Howie J, all of which are applied to the facts and circumstances in which the pleas were entered.88 The Crown acknowledged that the Applicant’s mental health at the times to which the material speaks is relevant to the determination of sentence, but not otherwise in this case.89 I raised the question of the fitness of the Applicant to take part in the proceedings, but the Crown submitted that this question would arise only if the Applicant was permitted to withdraw his pleas of guilty, upon which event section 20B of the Crimes Act, 1914 would be of application.90 The Applicant’s solicitor did not seek to have the matter adjourned further for counsel to argue the question of the Applicant’s fitness and whether it was appropriate at this stage to consider the issue, but pressed the tender of the material in support of the application before me.91 I have reviewed the material. It relates to two separate admissions.92 The first for the period from 29th September 2006 until the 5th November 2006, following the domestic disturbance, which prompted the further adjournment of the proceedings. I have been given no assistance with regard to the records relevant to this admission. There is no report from any medical practitioner offering an interpretation of the observations made against the history taken from the Applicant and his wife. All that I am in a position to find is that there is a record of conduct on the part of the Applicant consistent with the observations made earlier by Dr. Carne and Ms Collins, but in the circumstances this is of limited assistance. I would not be prepared to make findings upon this material without evidence from a practitioner with the necessary training and experience to qualify them for the purpose of providing a reliable assessment of the Applicant’s state of mental health.93 The second admission, at the Prince of Wales Hospital, on the 15th and 16th October 2006 is the subject of a discharge summary. It appears that the Applicant had a fall of 1.5 metres onto rocks at Maroubra Beach from which he suffered injuries. According to the document,  
     
      
      Reviewed by psych registrar and was not found to have any acute psychosis requiring treatment. Pt is refuing (sic) anti-psychotic medication and is not a candidate for a compulsory treatment order. 
      
    94 There is no evidence before me as to the circumstances of the fall.95 I propose to admit these documents as some evidence relevant to the question of the mental health of the Applicant. Although the material relates to events which occurred after the occasion of the pleas of guilty, they are sufficiently proximate to bear upon the question of the Applicant’s mental health when he pleaded guilty to these charges.96 However, for the reasons offered, little weight is to be given to the evidence relevant to the first admission, and the findings upon the second admission offer but limited support for the representations made regarding to the Applicant’s mental health. Moreover, I have no evidence before me regarding the circumstances leading to these admissions, beyond the bare references to those events in the documents tendered.97 Accordingly, although I find that the documents are relevant, I find that they provide little assistance in the resolution of the question I must resolve.The Relevant Principles and their Application98 The Applicant bears the onus of showing why he should have leave to withdraw these pleas of guilty: Regina v Abbruzzese [2006] NSWCCA 207. 99 The relevant principles were summarised in R v Van (2002) 129 A Crim R 229 at [48]. Although dealing with the question of an appeal from a conviction entered as a consequence of a plea of guilty, they are clearly of application of the decision I must make as to whether the Applicant should have the leave he seeks: Wong v DPP (2005) 155 A Crim R 37 @ [15].100 In general terms, the court should act upon the pleas of guilty if entered in open court by the Applicant, acting with a sound mind and understanding of the matters to which he was pleading guilty, in the exercise of his free choice made in his own interests. Even if he is indeed not guilty of the offences, there is no miscarriage of justice if the Court does act upon such pleas of guilty: Meissner v The Queen (1995) 184 CLR 132 @ 141.101 I am satisfied that the Applicant did understand and appreciate the nature of the charges to which he pleaded guilty, and that his decision to so plead was free and voluntary and made in his interests after having received advice from those who from time to time advised and represented him. There was no threat, nor inappropriate pressure applied to the Applicant. This was expressly disavowed by his counsel. 102 Notwithstanding that his counsel disavowed any suggestion of misconduct on the part of the solicitors or counsel representing the Applicant, in his evidence and representations to which I have referred above the Applicant has maintained throughout that his decision was made as a consequence of the pressure brought upon him by them. Before Puckeridge DCJ he referred in terms to some of the advice he received regarding the fact that he was working at the time he received money, and that he was therefore bound to plead guilty, in default of which he would need to find alternative representation. He referred to the criminal proceedings, and the civil proceedings relating to the recovery of assets. His evidence before Freeman DCJ referred to the seizure of assets, and the sale of property by the authorities, and attributed his present circumstances to the advice from his representatives, which included advertence to the benefits to be derived upon sentence from that course. He told his Honour of his understanding that he was entitled to receive the Commonwealth benefits the subject of the charge, that he understood the elements of the charges, and that the nature of the charges were explained to him. He finally told his Honour that the solicitors acting for him were pushing him to plead so that he could get a lesser sentence, and said that not one of them asked him for his version or explanation of the matters alleged against him.103 I am satisfied that his pleas were unequivocal. There is no evidence before me of any inappropriate advice by those representing the Applicant. The submission made on his behalf is that he was not in a fit state to be making the decision, and should not be held to it in the circumstances. However, even though there is evidence in support of the state of mental health upon which the Applicant relies for this submission, still the question remains whether the Applicant was thereby comprised in his capacity to make his decision, such that the integrity of the pleas of guilty has been dissolved. I do not believe that the integrity of the pleas of guilty has been comprised so, and I am not of the view that a miscarriage of justice would arise from the court acting upon them.104 Moreover, the Applicant’s understanding of the matters to which he pleaded guilty is further reflected in the representations attributed to him by the psychologist and the psychiatrist.105 Before me, the Applicant maintained that he was not guilty, but pleaded guilty only because of the advice that was given to him. 106 I do not accept the evidence and representations of the Applicant to the effect that he pleaded guilty because the pressure from his solicitors and counsel. The history of the proceedings, and the change of representation from time to time challenges any such proposition. 107 I do not accept that the Applicant’s mental health made him vulnerable to or susceptible by reason of his state of mental health addressed by Ms Collins and Dr. Carne, and therefore to be assessed as if he were overborne by the conduct of those representing him, even though upon any objective assessment of the evidence before me it could not be said that there has been any such conduct by those representatives.Conclusion108 For these reasons, I refuse the application to withdraw the pleas of guilty entered by the Applicant before his Honour Judge Berman S.C. in the District Court at Sydney on the 25th July 2005.

    JUDGMENT1 HIS HONOUR: This morning, after one of the breaks involving the jury leaving the courtroom, I was given a message from the jury. It reads “1 x a juror requesting transcripts please”. The matter was deferred until matters could be looked at over lunch. 2 Mr Campbell for his client maintains that I should not accede to the request of the juror, and that I should not provide transcripts to the juror either now or at any stage of the trial. It is his submission that things in this trial should take place in his client’s presence. A juror's review of the transcript would not take place in his client’s presence which he says breaches the requirements of a proper trial. He also submits that because this is a short trial there is no utility in providing transcripts to the jury and indeed there is the risk that jurors will focus on the transcript rather than their recollection of the evidence.3 I find it puzzling in this day and age that jurors are not provided automatically with daily transcripts of what they have just heard. Even in a short trial where the facts are in a narrow compass such as this, jurors will no doubt find themselves in the position where they are unable to recall precisely what the evidence was on a particular issue. This is moreso the case where they, unlike the parties, do not know in advance the nuances of the various aspects of the evidence. 4 I will give an example from this trial. At one stage the address 105 Frederick Street was mentioned. At that stage, the jurors had not heard anything regarding 105 Frederick Street. They did not know, although I did because I had heard evidence about it on the voir dire, that two of the Crown’s witness happened to be in 105 Frederick Street at the time of the collision. I use this as an illustration. The jurors would not have appreciated the significance of the address at the time the evidence was given. For this reason, jurors may not recall every aspect of evidence which is given before them.5 When this issue came up, I mentioned to counsel that my recollection was that some work done by Professor Warren Young in New Zealand in his important and well-known jury research project should be examined. I will not delay matters by repeating in this judgment the methodology which Professor Young followed but he does note that the juries which he studied were rarely told specifically that they would not be receiving a written copy of what in New Zealand is called the Judges Notes but in New South Wales we call the transcript. They were quite surprised that they did not get what the stenographers were clearly reporting. As a matter of common sense one can understand their surprise. It is they who as jurors ultimately make the most important decision in this case and to deny them the assistance of a transcript which is given to both parties and the Judge makes no sense at all. 6 In the discussion paper put out by the New Zealand Law Commission following Professor Young’s research he notes that the present practice in New Zealand was that the Judge’s Notes, and I emphasise again that that means the transcript, is not given to the jury unlike the situation in New South Wales where it commonly is.7 At paragraph 87 of the Law Commission Report, Juries in Criminal trials Part 2, A Discussion Paper, the authors of the report note: 
     
      
      “The juries in the Research expressed a strong wish to receive a copy of the judge’s notes. At present they do not receive a copy because it is believed that; 
       
       
      Juries will become too absorbed in pouring over the judge’s notes and be distracted from issues of credibility and demeanour.” 
      
     I interrupt the quotation to interpolate that that is one of the matters that Mr Campbell raised. Returning to the quote; 
     
      
       
      “Jurors will get side tracked into details and deliberations will get prolonged as a result. 
       
       
      The Research suggests that these concerns are unfounded. Many juries already spend a lot of time trying to agree on a version of the evidence from the notes they have collectively taken, and search their own notes or the notes of others when they cannot recall a section of the evidence critical to the discussions. They also frequently need to have portions of the evidence read back to them. There is little reason to believe that they would pay much more attention to the judges notes than they currently do to their own notes, and every reason to believe that the provision of a copy of the judges notes, by eliminating the currently sometimes lengthy arguments, about what evidence has actually been given, would not only enable discussions to become more focused but also reduce deliberation time. It is to be expected that jurors are becoming computer literate and could use a search facility in the jury room. The main difficulty in giving the jury a copy of the judge’s notes is ensuring that they are accurate and the abbreviations intelligible. This could become the joint responsibility of judge and counsel, with the vetted notes being provided to the jury shortly after they retire to consider their verdict.” 
      
    8 Thus, what I consider to be commonsense, accords with the position adopted by the New Zealand Law Commission in that discussion paper.9 Section 55C of the Jury Act says that I am in a position to provide to the members of the jury a copy of the transcript if they request it, and if I consider it appropriate and practical to do so. The jury has made a request, at least on behalf of one of the jurors. It is practicable to supply that transcript. As I speak yesterday’s transcript is being prepared, as is today’s.10 For the reasons I have given above I consider it appropriate that it be given to the jurors.11 I should say something specifically about one matter raised by Mr Campbell, that is, that his client has a right to see that things that happen in the trial happen in his presence. That right does not extend to the jury’s deliberations being conducted in his presence. Deliberations do not only occur at the end of a trial. Deliberations occur, I am sure, at each adjournment and the jury no doubt discuss their impression of the evidence, their recollection of the evidence, and the significance of what they have just heard. Part of those discussions will of course involve them relating what they have just heard to what occurred some time before and in doing so they would be assisted by having before them a transcript of what has gone before.12 For more abundant caution, although I do not think it is strictly necessary, I will tell the jury that they should not allow the transcript to take the place of their recollection of the evidence, but use it instead as an aid to remembering what the evidence was.

      JUDGMENT 
       
       
      Introduction 
       
      
    1 On 21 December 1999 the defendant, a surgeon specialising as an upper gastrointestinal surgeon endoscopist, performed a cholecystectomy, a colonoscopy and an upper endoscopy (gastroscopy) upon the plaintiff. The procedures were performed consecutively whilst the plaintiff was under a general anaesthetic. The upper endoscopy revealed a polyp of the duodenum. Whilst the plaintiff remained under the anaesthetic the defendant performed an endoscopic snare removal of the polyp.  
     
      
    2 Unfortunately the duodenum was perforated in the course of the procedure. The perforation was not discovered at that time and sepsis occurred, resulting in the plaintiff requiring further medical attention and leaving her with ongoing problems.  
     
      
    3 The plaintiff has sought damages from the defendant for the perforation of the duodenum and its consequences. Essentially her case is that the defendant was negligent and in breach of contract in that he failed to adequately warn her of the risks involved, failed to advise her of alternative and safer procedures which were available to remove the polyp, failed to reserve the polyp removal for a later time, and failed to take reasonable care to ensure the plaintiff was not injured in the performance of the surgery. It was also asserted the defendant should not have performed the three procedures at the one time nor should he have performed them in the order which he did. No complaint in relation to the actual performance of the cholecystectomy or colonoscopy procedures is made. 
     
      
    4 The defendant concedes the plaintiff sustained a perforation of the duodenum but denies there was any negligence or breach of contract on his part. Accordingly the issues for the determination of the Court are the defendant’s liability to the plaintiff and, if liability is established, the assessment of the plaintiff’s damages. 
     
      
       
      Background facts 
       
       
      The parties 
       
      
    5 The plaintiff was born on 24 August 1955 in Serbia. She came to Australia in 1969. In 1972 she married. In 1973 a daughter was born to her. In 1976 she divorced and in 1980 moved from Australia to Belgrade. In February 1997 she returned to Australia. The plaintiff worked in clerical positions and as a travel consultant. In September 1999 she took employment as an employment officer with Centrelink Sydney. Prior to the operation the plaintiff was “pretty fit”, played tennis three times per week and had a fairly active social life. She had done some modelling, though mainly as a hobby. 6 In January 1996 the presence of a gallstone was noted. A cholecystectomy was offered but declined. In September 1999 the plaintiff had a severe attack of pain in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen. Ultrasound confirmed the presence of a gallstone. The plaintiff was then referred by her general practitioner to the defendant for removal of the gallbladder (cholecystectomy). 7 The defendant was born on 9 April 1955. He is a legally qualified medical practitioner. He obtained the degree of MBBS in 1979, and was admitted as a fellow of the Royal Australian College of Surgeons in 1986 and of the American College of Surgeons in 2002. He is a Clinical Associate Professor of Surgery at the University of Sydney and Senior Specialist, Department Head, Upper GI Surgery Endoscopy at Concord Hospital. He is a Visiting Medical Officer at Strathfield Private Hospital and Sydney Adventist Hospital. He is a Director of the Sydney Heartburn Clinic Oesophageal Diagnostic Laboratory. He has presented and published a number of papers with respect to endoscopy, attended workshops and lectured in respect of endoscopic surgery of the stomach and oesophagus. 
     
      
    8 The defendant trained as a surgeon but for the past 16 years has almost exclusively practised upper gastrointestinal surgery predominately performing laparoscopic and endoscopic procedures and some major operations for cancer. As to the performance of polypectomies (removal of polyps) he said he had never had a perforation before. He gave the following evidence: 
     
      
       
        
        Q. What other endoscopic procedures do you do? 
         
        A. I perform polypectomy more or less in a tertiary referral circumstance in the upper gastrointestinal tract for colleagues, both physicians and surgeons, who refer work from across Sydney and the State for difficult polyps that are likely to haemorrhage. 
         
         
        Q. Of your practice in which you do perform polypectomies, upper gastrointestinal polypectomies, are you referring both to the duodenum and the colon? 
         
        A. I am referring predominantly to the duodenum and stomach. 
         
         
        Q. How many polypectomies would you perform for the duodenum and the stomach on average per annum? 
         
        A. I would perform quite a large number of polypectomies by multiple different techniques. The patients who are referred to me are referred with a view to my advice as to whether open surgery is appropriate, whether endoscopic or flexible surgery through the mouth is appropriate, or whether or not keyhole surgery would be sufficient to remove the polyp, and so of the polyps that I see a number will be treated in different ways, but probably endoscopically through the mouth similar to this situation we are addressing today I would do about five a year. 
         
         
        Q. Of those five a year, that's from the duodenum, is it? 
         
        A. That's from the duodenum, yes. 
         
         
        Q. As at December 1999 what was the nature of your practice with respect to polypectomies of the duodenum? 
         
        A. It has been fairly constant in the amount of referral work I have been doing for maybe the last ten years, so the amount of work I was doing is relatively unchanged. 
         
         
        Q. In addition to the five polypectomies you do per annum for duodenum, I take it you do other polypectomies as well? 
         
        A. Yes, predominantly gastric polypectomies which are usually much larger than the situation one sees in the duodenum and much more likely to haemorrhage. 
         
         
        Q. On average how many of those would you do per annum? 
         
        A. Maybe 10 or so I would think, and the remainder of the polypectomies I do by flexible means would be colon polyps. 
         
         
        Q. How many of those would you do per annum? 
         
        A. Ten or 15 maybe, as my practice is predominantly upper gastrointestinal. 
         
        
       
       
      The Preoperative consultation 
      
    9 The plaintiff consulted the defendant on one occasion only before the operation. This was on 6 December 1999. The consultation involved the taking of a history, an examination, discussion and agreement as to the course to be taken. The memory of each party was deficient as to precisely what was said at the consultation. The plaintiff accepted that her memory was “not very good at all” and that there were some aspects she “might not remember any longer”. The defendant, while having an independent recollection of some aspects, accepted he did not remember clearly the contents of the conversation and, in giving his evidence of the consultation, relied to a considerable extent upon his usual practice and some notes made at the consultation. 
     
      
    10 Notwithstanding these difficulties it appears to me from the evidence, and I find, that at the consultation: 
     
      
       
        
        (a) the plaintiff complained of indigestion, bloated abdomen, palpitations, pain and feeling sick. She reported other dyspeptic symptoms which were suggestive of duodenal ulcer, reflux or motility disorder. She gave a history of a previous duodenal ulcer, stubbornness of the bowel and a family history of colon cancer; 
        
       
       
        
        (b) the parties discussed the issue of gallbladder pain. The defendant confirmed it was appropriate at that stage to undertake a cholecystectomy if the plaintiff wished. The defendant explained what he proposed to do and that he would perform the procedure using keyhole surgery which would leave only a small incision though circumstances could arise which would require converting from keyhole surgery to open surgery. The plaintiff indicated she was prepared to undergo open surgery in respect of the gallbladder if, in the defendant’s opinion, it became necessary; 
        
       
       
        
        (c) the plaintiff told the defendant she wished to have a colonoscopy (examination of the lining of the rectum and colon using an instrument inserted via the anus) performed as she was over the age of 40 years and her mother had had a bowel tumour. The defendant said this procedure involved using an instrument to “have a look”. The plaintiff said there was no mention of any surgery in relation to the procedure. The defendant said that he would have told the plaintiff, as was his routine practice, that if a polyp was found on colonoscopy that it would be removed. The plaintiff did not recall this being said but said it was possible. I accept it as more likely than not that the defendant, as part of his usual practice, did tell the plaintiff of this at the consultation and she has forgotten it. The plaintiff accepted that the defendant probably, in accordance with his usual practice, explained there was a risk of bleeding or perforation of the bowel but that the likelihood of the risk eventuating was small; 
        
       
       
        
        (d) the defendant suggested to the plaintiff she should have an endoscopy (an examination of the lining of the oesophagus, stomach and duodenum (first portion of the small intestine) using an instrument (endoscope) inserted via the mouth). The plaintiff knew what an endoscopy was and the defendant confirmed her understanding. The plaintiff could not remember why the defendant suggested endoscopy but the defendant gave evidence, which I accept, that he considered it appropriate having regard to the dyspeptic symptoms and that it was important to determine the presence or absence of helicobacter. I also accept it was the defendant’s usual practice to explain there was a risk of bleeding and perforation occurring during the procedure but that it was rare. The plaintiff said she didn’t remember this but it seems to me more probable than not that it was said as it was the defendant’s usual practice. The defendant did not mention the possibility of finding a polyp on endoscopy; 
        
       
       
        
        (e) the plaintiff told the defendant that about 20 years ago she had undergone an anaesthetic but had not regained consciousness until some 12 hours after the operation and that as a result she was fearful of anaesthetics. The defendant formed the view the plaintiff was very frightened of anaesthetic and she only wanted to have one anaesthetic. She told him that she wouldn’t come back and have two separate anaesthetics. The plaintiff informed the defendant she had just started a new job; 
        
       
       
        
        (f) it was agreed the three procedures proposed were to be performed under anaesthetic. Because of her fear of anaesthetics and a desire not to lose too much time from her new job the plaintiff asked if the procedures could be carried out consecutively under the one anaesthetic. The defendant told her that although that was not ideal it could be done. The plaintiff requested that the procedures be carried out in that way. 
        
       
      
    11 At the conclusion of the consultation the plaintiff was given patient information brochures by the defendant or his staff in relation to each of the three procedures. The plaintiff said she read these documents after the consultation but before the operation. It was not suggested she was unable to understand the content of the brochures or that she attempted to contact the defendant for clarification of anything in them or in respect of the proposed procedures. The plaintiff next saw the defendant on 21 December 1999 “just briefly” at the hospital before she went into surgery. 
     
      
    12 The colonoscopy brochure relevantly states, under a heading “What if colonoscopy shows an abnormality?”: 
     
      
       
        
        If your surgeon sees an area that needs more detailed evaluation, a biopsy may be obtained … Polyps are generally removed. The majority of polyps are benign (non cancerous), but your surgeon cannot always tell by the outer appearance alone. They can be removed by burning (fulgurating) or by a wire loop (snare). It may take your surgeon more than one sitting to do this if there are numerous polyps or they are very large. Sites of bleeding can be identified and controlled by injecting certain medications or coagulating (burning) of bleeding vessels. Biopsies do not imply that cancer is suspected, however, removal of a colonic polyp is an important means of preventing colorectal cancer. 
        
       
      
    13 Under the heading “What complications can occur?” the colonoscopy brochure states: 
     
      
       
        
        Colonoscopy and biopsy are generally safe when performed by surgeons who have had special training and are experienced in these endoscopic procedures. Complications are rare. However, they can occur and include bleeding from the site of a biopsy or polypectomy and a tear (perforation) through the lining of the bowel wall. Should this occur, it may be necessary for your surgeon to perform abdominal surgery to repair the intestinal tear.  
        
       
      
    14 The upper GI endoscopy brochure states under the heading “Why do an upper endoscopy?”: 
     
      
       
        
        A variety of instruments can be passed through the endoscope that allow the surgeon to treat many abnormalities with little or no discomfort. Your surgeon can stretch narrowed areas, remove polyps …  
        
       
      
    15 Under the heading “What complications can occur?” the endoscopy brochure states: 
     
      
       
        
        Gastroscopy and biopsy are generally safe when performed by surgeons who have had special training and are experienced in these endoscopic procedures. Complications are rare. However, they can occur and include bleeding from the site of a biopsy or polypectomy and a tear (perforation) through the lining of the intestinal wall. 
        
       
      
    16 The plaintiff signed a consent form in the following terms:  
     
      
       
        
        I … request the following operation / procedure / treatment to be performed laparoscopic cholecystectomy, operative cholangiogram and colonoscopy and gastroscopy … I understand that other unexpected operations / procedures / treatments may be necessary and I request that these be carried out if required. 
        
       
       
        
        Although this operation / procedure / treatment is carried out with all due professional care and responsibility, I understand that in some circumstances the expected result may not be achieved.  
        
       
       
        
        I also understand that complications may occur with any operation / procedure / treatment and I accept the possible risks associated with this operation / procedure / treatment. 
        
       
       
      The procedure on upper endoscopy 
       
      
    17 The defendant’s usual practice in December 1999 in performing an upper endoscopy was described by him as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        The patient is positioned on their left-hand side in … foetal position, with the knees drawn up a little so that the body is stable. … [This] enables one to progress around the upper gastrointestinal tract with ease. … once the adequate level of anaesthesia is obtained to enable one to pass the endoscope beyond the gag reflex which is over the back of tongue, … a small cylinder … with a hole through the centre of it is placed between the teeth. [This] allows the endoscope to be passed. One passes the endoscope through the throat and into the oesophagus under vision … on a television screen. 
         
         
        The endoscope has a number of wheels on it which enable the tip of the endoscope to be flexed, moved about so it can look around corners and then it is passed down through the oesophagus … ,putting gas into the oesophagus, the head of the endoscopy using a separate button which will give a space which is otherwise not there, so it makes a tunnel out of something which is collapsed. One goes into the stomach in a similar fashion. … looks around the lining of the stomach, passes out of the stomach through the pylorus into the duodenum and down the duodenum a variable extent.  
        
       
      
    18 A polyp is a mass composed of neoplastic tissue or other structure. It was compared in evidence to a piece of broccoli in that it comprises a head on a long stalk (peduncle or pedicle). The stalk will vary in dimension from polyp to polyp. In some cases the polyp will be sessile i.e. attached by a broad base, rather than a long stalk. 
     
      
    19 A polyp of the duodenum is rare. It will almost inevitably be cancerous or precancerous. Polyps of the duodenum may be removed either by open surgery, by laparoscopic procedure or by an endoscopic snare procedure. 20 If a polyp is encountered on endoscopy it is necessary to assess its position and the available treatment options. Matters for consideration in this regard are the location of the polyp, the size of the polyp, whether it is pedunculated (this is unusual in a duodenal polyp) or sessile, whether it is of or under the mucosa and if it is obviously cancerous. 
     
      
    21 If it is determined to remove the polyp endoscopically then a lasso type structure at the end of the endoscope is placed over the polyp and it is ascertained whether it can close on the stalk or base. If it is able to be closed over the stalk or base then the snare is positioned and a diathermy current is applied to burn through the stalk and thus excise the polyp. The level of application of current is controlled by a foot switch. If the base is too thick for the lasso to close over it then the polyp can be removed piecemeal by snaring portions of it and applying diathermy current with progressive tightening of the snare as it cuts through the tissue. If the polyp is not to be removed then samples for biopsy normally are taken.  
     
      
       
       
       
      The operations 
       
      
    22 The laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed as the first of the three procedures. Then followed the other two procedures, in what order is not known. The defendant cannot recall and the operation notes are silent on this. 
     
      
    23 The defendant gave evidence there was nothing out of the ordinary in relation to the three procedures except the polyp. An operation note in respect of the endoscopy states: 
     
      
       
        
        Gastro large duodenal polyp snared. Observe for haemorrhage.  
        
       
      
    24 Two still photographs were taken using the endoscope. One shows the polyp in situ and the other the site after the polyp was removed. The polyp in the photograph was described as quite characteristic of a duodenal polyp. It was located in the second and third parts of the duodenum. It was sessile or partly pedunculated.  
     
      
    25 The principal medical witnesses qualified for the plaintiff who gave evidence in the proceedings were Professor Williamson, Professor Morris and Associate Professor Bolin. Professor Williamson was a consultant surgeon in London who had many years experience in complicated surgery of the epigastric area. However it was some 16 years since he had last performed an endoscopy. Professor Morris was a general surgeon who had specialised knowledge of the area involved but did not profess to have any significant experience in the treatment of polyps by way of endoscopic removal. Associate Professor Bolin was a physician who conducted an endoscopic practice. 
     
      
    26 The defendant qualified Dr Hugh, a surgeon who conducted an endoscopic practice, and Associate Professor Yeo a gastroenterology surgeon who did not do endoscopic polyp removal. Additionally of course there was evidence from the defendant of an expert nature. 
     
      
    27 It is against that background that the issue of liability falls to be determined. 
     
      
       
      Liability  
       
      
    28 The relevant duty owed, whether expressed in tort or as breach of an implied term of contract, was stated as follows in Rogers v Whittaker (1992) 175 CLR 479 at 483:  
     
      
       
        
        The law imposes on a medical practitioner a duty to exercise reasonable care and skill in the provision of professional advice and treatment. That duty is a ""single comprehensive duty covering all the ways in which a doctor is called upon to exercise his skill and judgment""; it extends to the examination, diagnosis and treatment of the patient and the provision of information in an appropriate case. It is of course necessary to give content to the duty in the given case.  
         
        The standard of reasonable care and skill required is that of the ordinary skilled person exercising and professing to have that special skill … 
        
       
       
      In this case the relevant skill was that of a surgeon specialising as an upper gastrointestinal surgeon endoscopist who practiced at a tertiary referral centre. 
       
      
    29 The plaintiff alleges the defendant breached that duty in a number of ways. These are considered separately hereunder. 
     
      
       
      The performance of the three procedures under the one anaesthetic 
       
      
    30 Associate Professor Bolin, in his report dated 17 October 2002 (exhibit H1) in answer to a question as to whether performing all three procedures in sequence was outside accepted medical practice stated that it was a highly unusual practice and not one he had ever seen done in the past. In cross examination in answer to a question that it was not substandard practice he replied “It would be highly unusual in my experience”.  
     
      
       
      Associate Professor Bolin is a physician. He does not perform laparoscopic cholecystectomies. It is not clear if his final position was that the defendant showed a lack of reasonable care in this regard. If it did I reject it, preferring the evidence of the other specialists (see in particular Dr Hugh) who accepted that it was not negligent to perform the three procedures consecutively, albeit it was not usual. I find that there was no breach of duty in this regard. Furthermore it has not been established the injury to the plaintiff resulted from the procedures being performed at the one time. 
      
     
     
      
      The order of performance of the three procedures 
       
      
    31 It was common ground the sequence in which the procedures were performed did not cause the injury to the plaintiff. 
     
      
    32 However the plaintiff submitted the defendant was negligent in performing the cholecystectomy before the diagnostic procedures because, if the diagnostic procedures had been performed first, the polyp would have been observed and the defendant could have elected to remove the polyp and the gallbladder by open surgery at the same time or, if the polyp had been removed endoscopically, the perforation would have been capable of being observed on laparoscopy and could have been immediately repaired by converting to an open operation. 
     
      
    33 In my opinion these submissions are the product of hindsight. There was no prescribed sequence for the performance of the procedures. The defendant performed the cholecystectomy before the diagnostic procedures. He did so as his previous experience had demonstrated that the insufflation of gas into the gastrointestinal tract during the endoscopy could cause difficulty in visualisation of structures at the bottom end of the gallbladder if the sequence of procedures was reversed. Additionally there was a problem as cannulisation of a distended abdomen for keyhole surgery was hazardous. Dr Hugh confirmed that these problems did arise. It was Dr Hugh’s practice to perform endoscopy after cholecystectomy. The defendant and Dr Hugh were the most experienced endoscopists of those who gave evidence.  
     
      
    34 The risk of a polyp being encountered was rare. The risk that a polyp would be encountered and that a perforation would occur, particularly at the hands of the defendant, was remote. In these circumstances in my opinion it would be quite unreasonable to categorise the defendant’s choice as to the sequencing of procedures as involving any breach of duty on his part. Accordingly I reject this head of alleged breach.  
     
      
      Failure to warn / advise of risks preoperatively 
       
      
    35 The alleged breach in this regard was particularised in the Amended Statement of Claim as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        (i) Failure to properly or adequately warn the plaintiff of the risks involved in the surgery contemplated; 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        (v) Failure to warn or adequately warn the plaintiff of the increased risks of duodenal perforation by laparoscopic snare removal of the polyp rather than its removal by open operation before such removal was attempted. 
        
       
       
        
        (vi) Failure to advise the plaintiff of alternative and safer procedures to remove the polyp. 
        
       
      
    36 The applicable legal principles are: 
     
      
       
        
        … a doctor has a duty to warn a patient of a material risk inherent in the proposed treatment; a risk is material if, in the circumstances of the particular case, a reasonable person in the patient’s position, if warned of the risk, would be likely to attach significance to it or if the medical practitioner is or should reasonably be aware that the particular patient, if warned of the risk, would be likely to attach significance to it. This duty is subject to the therapeutic privilege –  
        Rogers v Whittaker  
        (1992) 175 CLR 479 at 490. 
        
       
       
        
        … [the] standard is not determined solely or even primarily by reference to the practice followed or supported by a responsible body of opinion in the relevant profession. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        … in the field of non-disclosure of risk and the provision of advice and information … the courts have adopted the principle that, while evidence of acceptable medical practice is a useful guide for the courts, it is for the courts to adjudicate on what is the appropriate standard of care after giving weight to ""the paramount consideration that a person is entitled to make his own decisions about his life.” –  
        Rogers v Whittaker  
        at 487. 
        
       
      
    37 It was common ground that the finding of a polyp on upper endoscopy was unlikely. Professor Williamson described such a finding as “rare”. Associate Professor Bolin, who performed 750 upper gastric tract endoscopic procedures per annum said that in a three year period he had encountered only two duodenal polyps. Professor Morris described it as a rare condition. Dr Hugh described the finding of a polyp such as the plaintiff’s as an extremely unexpected event. The defendant described it as rare. 
     
      
    38 There was an acknowledged risk of perforation occurring during upper endoscopic removal of a duodenal polyp. This risk also was rare. Dr Hugh referred to a risk level with colonic polypectomy of between 0.5 – 1% but was a little reserved as to the correlation between colonic and duodenal polyps. 39 Thus the risk of the injury to the plaintiff which in fact eventuated required the conjunction of two rare events.  
     
      
    40 It was not the defendant’s practice to discuss duodenal polyps with a patient because it was so rare in the upper gut. He did not discuss the possibility of finding a polyp or polypectomy with the plaintiff.  
     
      
    41 None of the medical experts who gave evidence, save perhaps Professor Morris, would have warned the plaintiff of this risk. In particular Professor Williamson did not think he would mention the outside possibility of a polyp being found. Dr Hugh said no warnings of possible complications would be given. Associate Professor Bolin considered that as the presence of a polyp was totally unexpected, it would not be reasonable to expect the surgeon to inform the patient of the risks of polyp removal. There were no signs or symptoms evidencing the presence of the polyp. 
     
      
    42 I accept that a responsible body of medical opinion would not have warned the plaintiff of the possibility of a polyp being found, much less of the risk of perforation of the duodenum, if endoscopic removal of the polyp was attempted. There would thus have been no cause to discuss with the patient the comparative benefits of endoscopic removal and open surgery. 
     
      
    43 The defendant had given the plaintiff a general warning that there was a risk of haemorrhage or perforation inherent in an endoscopic procedure. The endoscopy brochure confirmed this and made reference to the removal of polyps and that complications at the site of the polypectomy could occur. It referred to the complications of haemorrhage and perforation. The plaintiff was aware that there were risks inherent in every medical procedure. In my opinion, a general warning of the nature given was adequate considering the rarity of the events which in fact occurred. No specific warning of the possibility of the risk of perforation of the duodenum resulting from polypectomy was required. 
     
      
    44 If I am wrong in that conclusion it would be necessary to consider the issue of causation i.e. what would have occurred had an appropriate warning been given. 
     
      
    45 A defendant is not causally liable, and therefore legally responsible, for wrongful acts or omissions if those acts or omissions would not have caused the plaintiff to alter his or her course of action – Chappell v Hart  (1997 – 1998) 195 CLR 232 at [32].The onus is on the patient to prove that he or she would have decided not to have the operation if given a warning of the risk of harm. That means that the patient must prove what he or she would have decided to do – Rosenberg v Percival (2001) 205 CLR 434 at 449 [45]. 
     
      
    46 Whether a patient would have undertaken a procedure, if warned of the risk of harm therein, involves a subjective test. It is not decisive that a reasonable person would or would not have undertaken a procedure although what a reasonable person would or would not have done in the patient’s circumstances will almost always be the most important factor in determining whether the Court will accept or reject the patient’s evidence as to the course that the patient would have taken. But what a reasonable person would have done is not conclusive. The finding which the Court must make is what this patient would have done if warned of the risk – Rosenberg v Percival at 443 [24]. 
     
      
    47 No evidence in chief was adduced from the plaintiff that, had she been warned of the risk of perforation on removing the polyp endoscopically, she would not have had that procedure. 
     
      
       
        
       
      
    48 The evidence of the plaintiff was: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Q. Had the possibility of surgery been raised with you, are you able to say what you would have agreed to with the doctor? 
         
        A. It would all depend of how the surgery would have been performed and what risks were involved. 
        
       
      
    49 In Ellis v Wallsend District Hospital (1989) 17 NSWLR 553 at 581 Samuels JA said: 
     
      
       
        
        It is, of course, true that a patient’s evidence about what he or she would have done if told of certain risks may be coloured by the fact that the risks did in fact eventuate; but it is open to a Court to disbelieve evidence found to be tainted by hindsight.  
        
       
      
    50 McHugh J in Rosenberg at [26] said:  
     
      
       
        
         
          
          … human nature being what it is, most persons who suffer harm as a result of a medical procedure and sue for damages genuinely believe that they would not have undertaken the procedure, if they had been warned of the risk of that harm. 
          
         
        
       
      
    51 Matters bearing on what would have been the plaintiff’s decision appear to me to be as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        (a) the defendant, if he had referred to the risk of perforation of the duodenum resulting from the removal of the polyp would have told the plaintiff of the slight possibility that a duodenal polyp might be found and that the polyp was likely to be malignant or pre-malignant and that it should be removed. He would also have told her that there was a slight possibility that a perforation could occur in removing the polyp though he had never experienced such a perforation himself, and that, if in his opinion it was appropriate to do so he would remove the polyp endoscopically but would use open surgery if the circumstances indicated this was a preferable manner in which to proceed; 
        
       
       
        
        (b) the plaintiff was concerned for her life and would not have been prepared to take no action in respect of the removal of the duodenal polyp which was potentially malignant or pre-malignant; 
        
       
       
        
        (c) the plaintiff was conscious of her body image and would have wished to avoid unnecessary surgical scarring. She would therefore have favoured endoscopic removal over other procedures; 
        
       
       
        
        (d) the plaintiff had been referred to the defendant by her general practitioner, presumably on his recommendation, express or implied. The defendant was an Associate Professor with particular expertise in the relevant area of speciality. It would be reasonable to infer the plaintiff would trust his judgment and technical expertise in relation to her treatment. Indeed she indicated she was prepared to undergo open surgery in respect of the gallbladder if in the defendant’s opinion a conversion from keyhole surgery to open surgery was required; 
        
       
       
        
        (e) the plaintiff is an intelligent and mature woman who would be guided by reason and common sense (subject to her fears about anaesthetics) in reaching her conclusion as to what future course she should take. She would have been mindful in making her decision of the factors referred to above. 
        
       
      
    52 The plaintiff’s evidence quoted above [48] does not establish causation. Nor, in my opinion, can it be inferred. I have no doubt that had the defendant informed the plaintiff prior to the procedures being carried out that there was a slight possibility that a duodenal polyp would be encountered and that if the defendant considered it appropriate to do so he would remove it endoscopically at that time the plaintiff would have agreed to that course of action. This would be a reasonable response and there is no reason to apprehend that the plaintiff’s subjective response would have been otherwise. 
     
      
    53 Accordingly I do not uphold this head of liability. 
     
      
       
      Failure to defer removal of the polyp 
       
      
    54 The alleged breach in this regard is particularised in the Amended Statement of as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        (iv) Failure to restrict the said surgery performed on 21 December 1999 to the cholecystectomy, gastroscopy and colonoscopy procedures, reserving the duodenal polyp removal for an appropriate later time. 
        
       
      
    55 The plaintiff submitted the defendant’s failure to restrict the surgery by reserving the duodenal polypectomy for a later time was negligent. The proper course, it was submitted, was to complete the visual inspection of the upper gastrointestinal tract and then withdraw the endoscope, without removing the polyp or taking a biopsy, and when the plaintiff had recovered from the anaesthetic to inform her of the findings and the options open to her and obtain her instructions as to the further course to be taken. 
     
      
    56 The plaintiff’s submission was supported by Professors Williamson, Morris and Associate Professor Bolin save that each would have regarded it as a necessary procedure to take a biopsy before withdrawing. 
     
      
    57 The available options contended for were endoscopic removal or open surgery though laparoscopic surgery was also a possibility. No specialist advocated that nothing be done because of the likelihood the polyp was potentially cancerous or precancerous and the need for its prompt removal was mandatory. 
     
      
    58 Professors Williamson, Morris and Associate Professor Bolin advocated open surgery as the preferable way to proceed. This was because it was said to have fewer risks as the polyp could be clearly visualised and more space was available to remove it. 
     
      
    59 The defendant did not take the course of withdrawing without removing the polyp. In my opinion it was not incumbent on him to do so. He did not do so because his impression of the plaintiff was that she had a morbid fear of anaesthetic and would not consent to another anaesthetic if the procedure was not completed. In these circumstances he considered that the removal of the polyp was necessary as it was probably either malignant or premalignant. The alternative, advocated by the medical experts qualified for the plaintiff of taking a biopsy and then withdrawing, also involved a risk of harm particularly as a large sample or samples were required to ensure accurate pathology results were obtained. I note the plaintiff did not plead her case in trespass to the person nor was such a case pressed on hearing. 
     
      
    60 In my opinion the defendant did not act in breach of duty in removing the polyp and not deferring its removal. 
     
      
    61 If I am wrong in that conclusion the question of causation of injury would need to be considered. 
     
      
    62 The evidence of the plaintiff bearing on this question was: 
     
      
       
        
        Q. Had surgery been required as a result of that endoscopy, what did you have in mind? 
         
        A. I presume that after Dr Falk had a look and if he thought there was something to be, I needed the surgery, I would like him to explain the reason for it and what sort of surgery it would be. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And if there were optional versions of the surgery, in other words if you could do something endoscopically or if he had to do open surgery, what was your view about discussing that with the doctor as well? 
         
        A. Well, if there was an open surgery required I would accept it because I would have thought about the possibility of open surgery for gallbladder. 
        
       
      
    63 On the available evidence the defendant, if he had deferred removal of the polyp and was properly advising the plaintiff would have told her: 
     
      
       
        
        (a) he had found a duodenal polyp which should be removed; 
        
       
       
        
        (b) there were three ways to remove it: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (i) endoscopic snaring – he would be comfortable in removing it endoscopically. There was a risk of perforation but this was unlikely and had never occurred in any such procedure performed previously by him. Endoscopic removal would not cause any visible scarring and she would be back at work in 1 – 2 days; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (ii) laparoscopy – this was a technically difficult procedure and he would prefer endoscopic snare removal. This procedure would result in minor scars and a period off work of 4 – 5 days; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (iii) open surgery – this would enable the polyp to be clearly visible but involved some risks and would leave a relatively large scar. It would result in a greater period of absence from work. 
          
         
        
       
      
    64 In my opinion reasonable care did not require the defendant to advise open surgery, or laparoscopic surgery in preference to endoscopic snaring. The laparoscopic procedure was technically difficult and there was no clear cut advantage in having open surgery as opposed to endoscopic surgery where the latter was performed by an experienced and skilled endoscopist which the defendant, in my opinion, undoubtedly was. All procedures involve risks. Professor Morris indicated that in addition to scarring with open surgery there was a risk of wound dehiscence, peritonitis and sepsis as well as anaesthetic risks. Associate Professor Bolin was of the opinion that risks of surgical removal of a duodenal polyp were less than an endoscopic polypectomy:  
     
      
       
        
        … unless you practice in a centre where there is a huge experience in removing these things and you act as a tertiary referral centre, so patients are sent from all around the State or from other countries. 
        
       
       
      The defendant, of course, performed polypectomies in tertiary referral circumstances with referrals of difficult cases to him from Sydney and throughout the State. Associate Professor Bolin was unaware that the defendant operated in such a centre. The difference between the experts on this question was primarily one dependant upon their area of practice. As Professor Williamson accepted, it was a matter for clinical judgment as to which procedure should be performed. 
       
      
    65 In my opinion it is probable the plaintiff would have instructed the defendant to proceed with an endoscopic snare removal which would entail the same risks as if the procedure had been carried out initially. Deferring the procedure would have simply exposed the plaintiff to additional risks involved in taking a biopsy during the first procedure.  
     
      
    66 The plaintiff’s evidence recorded at [62] above does not establish she would have instructed the defendant to take some other course than endoscopic removal of the polyp. Nor should it be inferred. In my opinion the plaintiff has not established causation. I do not uphold this head of liability. 
     
      
       
      Negligence in performance of endoscopy 
       
      
    67 The alleged negligence in this regard is particularised in the Amended Statement of Claim as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        (ii) Failure to perform the surgery with reasonable skill and care; 
        
       
       
        
        (iii) Failure to take reasonable precautions during the course of surgery to ensure that the plaintiff was not injured. 
        
       
      
    68 The plaintiff submitted “the way in which this procedure was carried out just speaks negligence on the part of the defendant.” 
     
      
    69 In an appropriate case the fact of the accident by itself is sufficient in the absence of an explanation to justify the conclusion that most probably the defendant was negligent and that his negligence caused the injury (res ipsa loquitur). However, as Scott LJ said in Mahon v Osborne (1939) 2 KB 14 at 21 - 23: 
     
      
       
        
        The presumption of fact only arises because it is an inference which the reasonable man knowing the facts would naturally draw, and that is in most cases for two reasons: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (i) because the control over the happening of such an event rested solely with the defendant, and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (ii) that in the ordinary experience of mankind such an event does not happen unless the person in control has failed to exercise due care … 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        How can the ordinary Judge have sufficient knowledge of surgical operations to draw such an inference … what does he know of “the ordinary course of things” in a complicated abdominal operation.  
        
       
      
    70 That res ipsa loquitur has no application in this case is underscored by the medical evidence that injury such as occurred could occur in the course of a polypectomy without negligence on the part of the surgeon. As Professor Williamson accepted, diathermy injury can occur in the best of hands and was not necessarily the result of substandard care and there was a fine balance between arresting haemorrhage and destroying the tissue to remove the polyp. 
     
      
    71 It is thus necessary, if the plaintiff is to succeed, for her to establish by reference to the evidence, a negligent act or omission on the part of the defendant. 
     
      
    72 The main thrust of the plaintiff’s case in this regard was that the size of the polyp and its sessile nature were such as to make it inappropriate for the defendant to proceed to endoscopic snare removal. There was no evidence that there were present any contraindicators for snare removal by reason that the polyp was obviously malignant or that the duodenum wall moved when the polyp was moved.  
     
      
    73 There was considerable debate as to the size of the polyp, whether there was a positive association between polyp size and perforation risk and whether the polyp could be removed safely by endoscopic snare removal. 
     
      
    74 There was evidence from Professors Williamson, Morris and Associate Professor Bolin that the larger the polyp the greater the risk as more diathermy was required. The defendant accepted that there was a correlation between the size of the polyp and the degree of hazard, though as Dr Hugh observed there was an absence of medical data to establish a positive association between polyp size and perforation risk. Dr Hugh did not accept such an association existed. Professor Morris accepted in cross examination that it was speculation on his part that the perforation occurred because it was a large polyp as a perforation can occur even in the smallest polyp. 
     
      
    75 Professor Williamson calculated the size of the polyp at 2.7 – 3 centimetres by adding together the size of the two pieces of polyp produced to the pathologist. In cross examination he conceded the figures calculated in that manner should have been 2.3 – 3 centimetres. His method of calculation was disputed by Dr Hugh and Associate Professor Yeo. Dr Hugh in his report dated 20 May 2005 (exhibit 2(1)) said: 
     
      
       
        
        3.7 The histopathology report indicates that the maximum measured diameter of the removed polyp was 20 mm. Although there was a second fragment with a maximum diameter of 10 mm there is no indication as to where in the morphology of the polyp this fragment was derived. It could easily have been from the base of the polyp, and it is stretching the facts to summate the largest diameters of these two fragments to obtain a spurious overall diameter exceeding 20 mm. In any case, I do not believe that the recommendation that polyps with a diameter > 20 mm should be removed by open operation has any supportable connection to the risk of endoscopic polypectomy perforation. 
        
       
      
    76 Associate Professor Yeo calculated the size of the polyp at approximately 1.8 centimetres. His method of calculation was criticised by Professor Williamson on the basis the premise adopted by Associate Professor Yeo as to the height of the polyp was not established. I do not regard either set of calculations as reliable. 
     
      
    77 The defendant said he used the endoscopic snare procedure to remove polyps up to 2 centimetres. He confirmed that the size of the polyp was not the subject of precise measurement whilst insitu and that the precise assessment of size was difficult. He accepted that the 2 centimetre diameter was an estimate and it was possible his estimate was not precise and that the polyp may have been as large as 2.5 centimetres. However he had four categories of polyp: tiny, moderate, large or too large to be removed endoscopically. If he did not feel confident about removing a polyp endoscopically he would not do so and instead would take pieces from it for biopsy or use an alternative procedure.78 Professor Williamson agreed that an experienced endoscopic surgeon ought to have a reasonable idea of the size of the polyp viewed through the endoscope. 79 The defendant explained that his usual practice was to use a blended current for diathermy which reduced the likelihood of a burn injury and that it was his usual practice to remove large polyps piecemeal further reducing the risk of a burn injury. Professor Williamson accepted that one way of obviating the risk when you have a large sessile polyp is to do piecemeal surgery. Professor Morris accepted many sessile polyps could be removed safely endoscopically and agreed piecemeal removal could decrease the risks of full thickness burns. The defendant said that the polyp had been removed piecemeal. Professor Williamson accepted that the decision to do endoscopic removal of the polyp was a matter of clinical judgment for the defendant based on what the defendant had observed and in the light of his skills and experience as to whether it was safe to excise the polyp endoscopically.  
     
      
    80 There were no guidelines and no specific standards as at December 1999 as to the size and type of polyp which may be endoscopically removed by the snare procedure. There was evidence that presently duodenal polyps up to 4 centimetres in diameter are routinely removed by the endoscopic snare procedure. 
     
      
    81 Professor Williamson agreed that the risk of perforation was present even with small polyps. He gave the following evidence: 
     
      
       
        
        Q. Ultimately it comes down to the particular circumstances of a case, notwithstanding of all the literature. It is still up to the clinical judgment of the particular surgeon at the time he was performing the surgery, isn’t that correct? 
         
        A. Indeed, the decision to embark on the polypectomy and by what means to carry it out, piecemeal or otherwise, those are the decisions that have to be made by the surgeon at the time. They are a judgment call.  
        
       
      
    82 Associate Professor Bolin gave the following evidence: 
     
      
       
        
        Q. And as a consequence of Dr Falk having that degree of experience it is the case, is it not, that his skill and judgment at the time really was determinative of whether or not it was safe to excise the polyp? 
        
       
      
     A. Yes. 
     
      
    83 The defendant gave evidence that almost all of the polyps which he had removed by the snare procedure were sessile and quite a good number were large. In his assessment the polyp was in the order of 2 centimetres in diameter. I accept his assessment of the polyp’s size. The defendant’s clinical judgment in this case based on his observations, skill and experience was that endoscopic removal of the polyp was appropriate. He was skilled and experienced in this area, more so than any other witness in the case. 
     
      
    84 Dr Hugh considered it was a matter for clinical assessment at the time by the surgeon to determine if it was safe to remove the polyp endoscopically. He considered the defendant’s actions in removing the polyp were reasonable. Associate Professor Yeo considered the snare removal fully justified and that the defendant’s care was of the highest standard. 
     
      
    85 In my opinion the plaintiff has not established the defendant was negligent in deciding that it was appropriate to remove the polyp using an endoscopic snare procedure. 
     
      
    86 The technique of polypectomy has a risk of perforation due to electrical cautering as there is necessarily some element of imprecision in the application of the current. The fact that a burn occurs does not indicate excessive diathermy as appropriate diathermy may cause a perforation. The evidence does not establish a lack of reasonable care in the application of the current by the defendant. 
     
      
    87 Professor Williamson suggested that it may have helped to inject the mucosa with saline to lift off a sessile polyp as an alternative to piecemeal removal. The plaintiff submitted that the defendant was negligent in not so doing. 
     
      
    88 The defendant agreed the use of a saline injection may be advantageous though its use may occlude the endoscopist’s view and reduce the area within which he is to work. However in 1999 it was not his practice to inject the mucosa with saline nor was it common practice to do so. It was an alternative to piecemeal removal. He considered piecemeal removal was a safe option in this case. 
     
      
    89 Associate Professor Bolin gave evidence on this issue. He said the purpose of injecting saline was to elevate the polyp off the mucosa and make it more accessible to snaring thereby reducing the risk of perforation. He said that the use of saline injections in the removal of large polyps had been in evolution in the last 7 – 8 years. When asked if it would have been known in 1999 he replied “perhaps not”. Dr Hugh and Associate Professor Yeo indicated it was not common practice to use such injections. 
     
      
    90 It was held in Rogers v Whittaker at 489: 
     
      
       
        
        Whether a medical practitioner carries out a particular form of treatment in accordance with the appropriate standard of care is a question in the resolution of which responsible professional opinion will have an influential, often a decisive, role to play. 
        
       
      
    91 I accept the use of saline injections was not common practice among the medical profession in this country in December 1999. The fact the defendant was not using it at the time does not, in my opinion, bespeak negligence on his part. Further the evidence does not establish that the use of a saline injection would, more likely than not, have obviated the injury which occurred.  
     
      
    92 The hospital (Strathfield Private) at which the operation was performed did not possess an ultrasound machine at that time. There was however one available at Concord Hospital which was in the same geographical area. It was common ground that an ultrasound would enable one to determine the degree to which the polyp had burrowed into the duodenal wall before excision. 
     
      
    93 The plaintiff submitted that the defendant was negligent in not withdrawing and taking the patient to Concord Hospital at a later time in order to obtain an ultrasound and thus be better informed about the nature of the polyp. 
     
      
    94 Ultrasound equipment was apparently not widely available at that time and could be unreliable. The defendant gave evidence that ultrasound results at that time could be inaccurate and that ultrasound was an adjunct. However the same information as an ultrasound would have given was capable of being clinically determined by moving the polyp and determining if the duodenal wall moved when the polyp was moved. This was the generally accepted test at the time and it was the defendant’s usual practice to perform that test. The pathology report confirmed there was no involvement of the muscle layer of the bowel.  
     
      
    95 Associate Professor Yeo agreed with Professor Morris that the endoscopic ultrasound was not an essential part of the plaintiff’s management. Associate Professor Yeo confirmed that had endoscopic ultrasound been performed it would have agreed with the depth assessment of the polyp being superficial, thus adding strong support to an endoscopic removal of the polyp. In these circumstances it does not appear to me that the defendant’s failure to defer the removal of the polyp until an ultrasound had been arranged indicated a lack of reasonable care on his part or was causative of injury. 
     
      
    96 In my opinion, it has not been established that the size of the polyp was causative of injury or that the defendant was in breach of the duty of care or contract in the performance of the snare procedure. 
     
      
    97 In my opinion the plaintiff has failed to establish liability on the part of the defendant. Accordingly there will be a verdict and judgment for the defendant with costs. 
     
      
       
      Damages 
       
      
    98 The conclusion which I have reached as to liability renders it unnecessary to determine damages. However, against the possibility the matter may go further, I make the following comments in that regard. 
     
      
       
      Background facts 
       
      
    99 The plaintiff, whilst in hospital, developed symptoms related to the perforation. She was returned to the operating theatre and surgery was performed which revealed the perforation. A repair procedure was performed. The plaintiff was in hospital for approximately four months as a result of the perforation. During part of this time she was in the Intensive Care Unit, her condition was life threatening and she underwent a number of procedures. She has no recollection of events from about that time until 23 February 2000.100 The plaintiff was discharged from hospital on 11 April 2000 and returned to her one bedroom townhouse. At that time she suffered pain in the stomach and back, urgency of bladder and bowel which, on occasions, caused embarrassing “accidents”. She also suffered headaches and had difficulty keeping food down. She had difficulty ambulating and spent much time in bed. There was a sinus in the stomach which eventually healed in about July or August 2000. 
     
      
    101 The plaintiff’s parents were on a holiday from Belgrade and had been living with the plaintiff since late November or early December. They continued to do so until they returned to Belgrade in July 2000. Initially after leaving hospital the plaintiff was unable to look after herself at all and required the help of her parents. The plaintiff said: 
     
      
       
        
        … my mother help me take a shower and wash my hair and she cooked for me. Did everything. 
        
       
       
      The parents cleaned the flat and accompanied the plaintiff to medical examinations. 
       
      
    102 By the time the plaintiff’s parents left Sydney in July 2000 the plaintiff’s capacity to look after herself had improved and she was able to shower by herself, to walk and to drive a car locally. 
     
      
    103 When her parents left a female friend came daily to keep her company. One day each week she would do some work as the plaintiff could not vacuum, wash the floors or windows or cook or tend to a small garden. She would also help the plaintiff with supermarket shopping once a week and ironing. 
     
      
    104 On 12 September 2001 the plaintiff underwent scar revision surgery. This resulted in the reduction of the abdominal scarring to a relatively narrow scar extending from just below the umbilicus level to just below the throat. Photographs taken on 2 April 2002 (exhibit D) depict a neat, non keloid scar and that the umbilicus has been removed. The scar has matured since the photographs were taken and is now paler than depicted therein. The surgery effected some improvement in abdominal pain and, to my mind, a great cosmetic improvement. The plaintiff was in hospital for 7-9 days in relation to this surgery. 
     
      
    105 The plaintiff has continued to complain of lower back and stomach pains, frequency of bladder and bowel and headaches. She wears an incontinence pad which she finds distressing. The plaintiff complains of a very severe shooting pain in the abdomen which lasts a few seconds and can occur once a week or on a few days during the week. The plaintiff wears a corset which makes her “feel protected”. She said she gets at least one headache per day, sometimes two or three and they sometimes last all week. She takes Panamax for the headaches, two to eight tablets per day. They provide some relief. Additionally the plaintiff complains of painful shoulders, that she feels “ugly” and that her social life is almost non existent. She is presently able to walk for half to three quarters of an hour at a slow pace and then has to sit down due to pain in her stomach and back. 
     
      
    106 The plaintiff has consulted her general practitioner, Dr Trjilkovic regularly. She has been referred to various specialists and has had physiotherapy and chiropractic treatment. The latter helped straighten her upper back which had become curved from being nursed in a “banana position”. She was referred to the Pain Management Clinic at Prince of Wales Hospital. There she was prescribed Endone for her stomach and back pain. She says she continues to take Endone up to four a day and sometimes six per day though they do not completely rid her of the pain and discomfort which she suffers.  
     
      
    107 The plaintiff claims she has lost her sense of taste, has difficulty keeping food down and cannot eat spicy foods as she complains of problems with swallowing, digestion and constant reflux. These symptoms have not improved. She cannot eat normal sized meals and as a result has increased the number of meals she eats each day. Dr Vickers has told her to avoid spicy food, sparkling drinks, chocolate, acidic food. Her weight has increased from 70 kilograms pre operatively to 100 kilograms at present. Despite dieting (under the advice of her general practitioner and a dietician) and exercise supervised by a personal trainer her weight has not reduced. The plaintiff is a smoker. 
     
      
    108 The plaintiff has sought assistance from psychiatrists and psychologists. She currently takes prescribed antidepressants which “help me a bit”. Her sleep is disturbed by pain and she has nightmares 3-5 days per week about hospitals. She takes a prescribed sleeping tablet each night. 
     
      
    109 On 20 January 2004 the plaintiff consulted a cardiologist for chest pain. An angiogram was clear. The plaintiff continues to have chest pains from time to time but it appears the source of the problem is oesophageal for which she has come under the care of Dr Vickers.  
     
      
    110 The plaintiff had been diagnosed with scoliosis when she was 15 or 16. She suffered back pains from time to time. By 1996 the pain was occurring every 2 – 3 weeks and lasting a few days. Radiological evidence at the time showed disc damage with degenerative changes in the lumbar spine. The plaintiff was referred to Dr Pillemer in respect of her back pain in 1996. In 1997 she attended a physiotherapist for her back. She continued to have intermittent back pain up to her hospitalisation though she said it did not prevent her doing anything. 
     
      
    111 The plaintiff continued to live in her townhouse for a time. In 2002 she formed a romantic attachment with a male friend and in October 2002 commenced to live with him in his two bedroom flat. By 2004 the romantic side of the relationship had ended as the plaintiff said she could not deal with a romantic partnership. The plaintiff and her friend continue to live together in the two bedroom flat. The friend at all times has employed a cleaner to attend to the cleaning of the flat. That was the case before the plaintiff came to live with him.  
     
      
    112 The plaintiff travelled to Europe on a number of occasions from June 2001 to 2004, generally alone. 
     
      
    113 The plaintiff attempted to resume work with Centrelink in the latter part of 2000 but said she found she was not able to sit by the computer for more than an hour due mainly to pain in her back and abdomen nor was she able to concentrate for more than an hour. The plaintiff made further attempts to resume work with Centrelink but suffered the same difficulties and in 2002 resigned due to health reasons. She considered she was unable to do any work between ceasing with Centrelink and 2005. 
     
      
    114 In March 2005 the plaintiff was employed in a travel agency by the person with whom she was living. The arrangement was that the plaintiff would work three afternoons per week doing clerical work for two to three hours each afternoon. The plaintiff said she was unable to work for two to three hours because: 
     
      
       
        
        Just being there constantly at a desk and answering the phones or doing some filing, I just - I couldn't do it. I was in too much pain, I couldn't. I would answer the phone and I would put the person on hold and I would forget the person's number, so that would make me very upset. 
        
       
       
      The work days were reduced to two per week but the plaintiff said, she was unreliable as her pain levels caused her on occasions to be unable to attend on the required days. The plaintiff ceased this work in August 2005 when a full time employee was hired to do the plaintiff’s work.  
       
      
    115 The plaintiff has not sought work since August 2005. She gave evidence as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        Q. Do you think you could do any work at all on a steady basis? 
         
        A. I don't know what I could do. 
        
       
      
    116 The plaintiff says the major source of pain, which is in the back and abdomen, varies from morning to evening and from day to day. At least three to four days per week the plaintiff says the pain is at such a level that she cannot contemplate going out or doing things. This would prevent her attending work on those days. In addition she continues to have difficulty in sitting at a computer or concentrating for more than an hour and in remembering things. The latter problems have not improved despite strategies suggested to her by psychiatrists and psychologists. 
     
      
    117 The defendant asserted the plaintiff had exaggerated her disability as she had been able to travel overseas on a number of occasions, generally by herself. A number of her complaints were not related to the perforation. 
     
      
    118 I would accept that symptomatic spinal pathology pre-existed the perforation but find the symptoms thereof were exacerbated as a result of the plaintiff being nursed in hospital in a banana position and by deconditioning of her musculature during her stay in hospital and convalescence. I would accept the effect of the exacerbation is continuing but decreasing and in time will be overtaken by the underlying degeneration. 
     
      
    119 I would accept the plaintiff, as a result of the perforation, has some ongoing stomach pain, abdominal scarring which is distressing to her as she is a woman conscious of her body image, a problem of urinary and faecal urgency which she finds embarrassing though she is normally able to manage the problem and avoid accidents and she suffers from headaches. 
     
      
    120 I would accept the opinion of Dr Skinner that the plaintiff is suffering from an adjustment disorder rather than a major depression. This essentially accords with the opinion of Dr Ellard who was qualified on behalf of the plaintiff. I prefer that diagnosis to that put forward by Dr Sokolovic. 
     
      
    121 Although the plaintiff effectively asserts she is unable to work and has little social life that is to be contrasted with the fact she able to drive a car and to travel overseas and for a time did share a romantic relationship. 
     
      
    122 On 21 December 2005 Dr Henke, who was qualified for the defendant reported (exhibit 2): 
     
      
       
        
        This woman’s presentation at this consultation was very similar to that seen in 2002. Once again her presentation appears to be predominantly that of a person with complaints of back and hip pain with lesser abdominal discomfort including some epigastric pain and gastric reflux. She also has urinary and faecal urgency and describes episodes of incontinence although these appear to be infrequent. 
        
       
       
        
        The extent of the physical symptoms and incapacity appears far greater than that which can be explained by the demonstrable pathology … Her current presentation again demonstrates symptoms predominantly those of mechanical origin arising from degenerative changes in her lower back. There is no evidence of any neurological dysfunction in the spine. I am unable to comment on the issues of her continence … Giving an exact recommendation of her needs remains difficult due to the psychological component of her symptoms. It would be expected that there is a reasonable probability that there will be an improvement in her symptoms on completion of any legal action and therefore this makes the definition of the exact need requirements of this lady difficult. One would therefore feel that although there has been only a minor improvement in her symptoms in the past two years there is still some potential for further improvement. 
        
       
       
        
        It is somewhat surprising that she has been able to tolerate a number of flights to and from Europe despite her ongoing symptoms. These would appear on the basis of her description of her symptoms to be beyond her physical capacity. Again this may add some weight to the feeling that emotional issues add to the severity of her symptoms … This woman remains unfit for work where she is required to sit or stand for prolonged periods or carry loads greater than 5kgs for extended periods. 
        
       
       
        
        I remain of the view that she has potential to work 3 – 4 hours per day doing clerical type duties. Indeed it is felt that there may be some psychological benefit to try and get this lady back into the workplace to try to add some positive input to her life.  
        
       
       
      I agree with these comments save that I would regard the plaintiff’s ultimate capacity to work in clerical type duties as likely to be greater than 4 hours per day. 
       
      
    123 Like Dr Skinner I do not accept the plaintiff will remain an invalid in her future life with respect to her psychiatric condition. I do not agree that she will remain dependant on psychiatric treatment in the future. 
     
      
       
      Quantum 
       
      
    124 I make the following comments as to the assessment of damages. 
     
      
       
        
        (a) General damages – the defendant suggests a range of $150,000 - $170,000. The plaintiff suggests $220,000. I would award $180,000 with interest at 2% on 2/3 of that sum; 
        
       
       
        
        (b) Past out of pocket expenses – the plaintiff claims a total of $86,889.19. The defendant objects to $4,930.65 of that claim on the basis the items have not been shown to be a consequence of the perforation. I would award $85,000 together with interest at 6% on such of the monies as were not paid by Medicare; 
        
       
       
        
        (c) Future out of pocket expenses – the plaintiff claims $219,217.60. The claim comprises: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (i) surgery: $20,000; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (ii) pharmaceuticals: $53,721.60; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (iii) health store: $145, 496. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        The defendant contends there is no evidence to support items (i) and (iii). That appears to be correct. The defendant would allow $10,000 - $15,000 for painkillers and antidepressant medication. I would allow $25,000; 
        
       
       
        
        (d) Past economic loss – the plaintiff effectively claims total loss of wages from 28 December 1999 to date less the plaintiff’s earnings during that period. The defendant concedes total incapacity to 30 June 2000 and thereafter loss of wages on the basis of a partial incapacity for work calculated at 10 hours per week. The plaintiff was totally incapacitated when undergoing and convalescing from the scar revision surgery in 2001 as well as the initial period of hospitalisation and convalescence. She is entitled to be compensated for total incapacity for those periods. I would also allow total incapacity from 28 December 1999 to 1 January 2001. Otherwise I would allow partial incapacity calculated at 50% of the earnings which the plaintiff would have received from Centrelink if uninjured. I would allow interest on past economic loss at 6%. I would allow past loss of superannuation calculated at 8% of the gross loss of earnings and interest thereon at 6%; 
        
       
       
        
        (e) Impairment of future earning capacity – the plaintiff claims total loss to age 65 less 15% for vicissitudes. The defendant contends an appropriate award would be a cushion in the amount of $45,000 - $90,000. I would allow impairment of future earning capacity calculated at 50% of the earnings she would have received from Centrelink had she continued to work there and been uninjured. I would calculate the loss to age 62 rather than 65 to allow for the likely effect of the plaintiff’s pre-existing conditions particularly that of the back. I would reduce the figure assessed by a further 10% for remaining contingencies. I would allow future loss of superannuation calculated at 9% of the gross loss of earnings; 
        
       
       
        
        (f) Past domestic assistance – the plaintiff claims past domestic assistance at an average of 11 hours per week to date. The defendant submits that insofar as part of that claim was for emotional support it is not compensable. The plaintiff expressly did not press that part of the claim. The defendant contends the assessment should be calculated at an average of 3 hours per day from the day the plaintiff was discharged from hospital (12 April 2000) to 12 July 2000 and thereafter at 1 hour per day to 1 November 2002 thereafter nil. The defendant points to the evidence that the cleaner employed by the friend with whom the plaintiff has lived since the end of October 2002 cleans the house, does the ironing and any heavy tasks. It is submitted that in those circumstances the plaintiff is not entitled to compensation for domestic assistance. I would accept the defendant’s submission. I would allow interest on past domestic assistance at 6%; 
        
       
       
        
        (g) Future domestic assistance – the plaintiff claims future domestic assistance at an average of 11 hours per week. The defendant contends this claim should be rejected. In my opinion the plaintiff would have difficulty in performing heavy cleaning tasks which could give rise to a compensable need if she was to cease to live with her friend or he ceased to employ a cleaner. The plaintiff may have had a need to employ a cleaner herself, irrespective of the perforation due to an increase of disability resulting from to her pre-existing back condition and other problems. In these circumstances I would award the plaintiff assistance for an average of 2 hours per week to age 70.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
      Orders 
       
      
    125 I make the following orders: 
     
      
    1. Verdict and judgment for the defendant; 
     
      
    2. The plaintiff to pay the defendant’s costs.

      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1 ROTHMAN J: The Director of Public Prosecutions seeks orders in the nature of certiorari and mandamus, together with consequential declarations, against the second defendant his Honour John McIntosh LCM in relation to the refusal of an adjournment sought by the plaintiff in the proceedings before the learned Magistrate. The plaintiff also seeks redress pursuant to the provisions of the Crimes (Local Courts Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW) (“the Appeal and Review Act”). The plaintiff appeals, pursuant to s56(1)(c) of the Appeal and Review Act, the order dismissing the matter and seeks leave, pursuant to the terms of s57(1)(c) of the Appeal and Review Act, to appeal the interlocutory decision refusing the adjournment. The primary remedy sought is certiorari and mandamus. 
     
      
    2 The proceedings before the learned Magistrate were proceedings relating to a number of offences, being a number of counts of contravening apprehended domestic violence order and use carriage service, being a telephone, to menace. The offences were said to have occurred between 2 and 9 November 2005.  
     
      
    3 On 9 November 2005 the first defendant was charged by Court Attendance Notice, appeared and bail was refused. The first defendant remained in custody, bail refused, from 9 November 2005 until 13 January 2006. On 13 January 2006 the first defendant was granted bail, which he entered on 14 January 2006.  
     
      
    4 The matter came before the Local Court on 24 March 2006 and a hearing date was fixed for 30 May 2006.  
     
      
    5 The offences charged relate to a single victim.  
     
      
    6 On or about 11 May 2006 the victim left Australia to attend to her father who was seriously ill due to a severe heart condition. On 13 May 2006 the informant endeavoured to contact the victim and was informed of the emergency in Turkey and the fact that the victim had left Australia temporarily. Contact was eventually made with the victim and the victim endeavoured to arrange her flights so that she would arrive in Sydney and be available to give evidence on 30 May 2006, the date of the listing.  
     
      
    7 The prosecutor contacted legal representatives of the accused and informed them of the position and that the prosecutor would be seeking an adjournment.  
     
      
    8 When the matter came before his Honour below there was initially no appearance by the legal representative for the defendant who had been apparently delayed. The accused was in attendance. Also in attendance were interpreters that were required for the purpose of cross-examining witnesses and another interpreter whom the defence wished to cross-examine because of that person’s role in the police interview.  
     
      
    9 When the legal representative of the defendant attended he confirmed to the Court the receipt of prior notice of the adjournment application in the following terms:  
     
      
       
        
        “My understanding your Honour is that the matter’s not ready to proceed today and I had the courtesy of a call from the informant on that.” 
        
       
       
      That was the only statement made by either the accused or his legal representative during the adjournment application. The adjournment application was not opposed by the accused.  
       
      
    10 After the refusal of the adjournment application, the matter proceeded a short way into the hearing but ultimately, because of the absence of evidence from the victim, there was no prima facie case and all matters were determined on the basis of no prima facie case and the charges were dismissed. The victim was expected to arrive home at 8pm on that evening.  
     
      
       
      A Refusal of Adjournment: General Principles 
       
      
    11 The general principle which applies to a decision to refuse (or grant) an adjournment application is that such a decision is a matter wholly within the discretion of the court or tribunal. An appeal against such a decision is an appeal against a discretionary decision and will be subject to interference by an appeal court only on one of the well known bases dealing with discretionary judgments: House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 499 at 504 – 505.  
     
      
    12 For an appeal court to interfere with an exercise of discretion there must be a basis other than that it would have taken a different course. There must be error. That error must either be identifiable or manifest. If identifiable it must be based upon wrong principle, mistake of fact or law or the failure to take into account all and only relevant matters.  
     
      
    13 However, in these proceedings the plaintiff does not put its case on the basis of an exercise of discretion. It seeks prerogative relief on the basis of, inter alia, a denial of natural justice. The Court raised with the parties during the course of the short hearing the judgment of Justice Deane in the following terms:  
     
      
       
        
        “A refusal to grant an adjournment can constitute a failure to give a party to the proceedings the opportunity of adequately presenting his case. If the Tribunal had, in the present matter, refused an application by the appellant for an adjournment to enable him to procure Dr Evans’ attendance as a witness, that refusal may well have constituted such a failure. No such application for an adjournment was, however, made. If it had been made, it is highly probable that the Tribunal would have acceded to it: indeed, counsel who appeared for the appellant stated that he did not dispute that, if the appellant had applied for an adjournment, the Tribunal would have granted it. The absence of any application for an adjournment does not, however, necessarily conclude the issue adversely to the appellant. The failure of a tribunal which is under a duty to act judicially to adjourn a matter may, conceivably, constitute a failure to allow a party the opportunity of properly presenting his case even though the party in question has not expressly sought an adjournment (see  
        Priddle v Fisher  
        [1968] 1 WLR 1478). In this regard, however, it is important to remember that the relevant duty of the Tribunal is to ensure that a party is given a reasonable  
        opportunity  
        to present his case. Neither the Act nor the common law imposes upon the Tribunal the impossible task of ensuring that a party takes the best advantage of the opportunity to which he is entitled.” ( 
        Sullivan v Department of Transport  
        (1978) 20 ALR 323 at 343, Full Court Federal Court of Australia, per Deane J with whom relevantly Fisher J agreed).  
        
       
      
    14 In circumstances described in the forgoing passage the refusal of an adjournment takes on a different character from the exercise of a discretion and, in such circumstances, is a denial of natural justice requiring different considerations than a simple exercise of discretion. In the instant proceedings the Magistrate refused the adjournment application in circumstances where his major consideration was case management. After reciting the history of listings for the purpose of setting hearing dates and the fact that the brief had been served on 13 January 2006 and that it had been set for 24 March 2006 to fix a date his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “On 24 March over to 30 May, today, for hearing. Listed for 3 hours. There are two Turkish interpreters were requested. One for, I take it, the alleged recipient of the telephone calls … and for the accused. … those two interpreters are present and there is a third interpreter. … so this is an expansive exercise. … there was a third interpreter present who the prosecutor has indicated was present when an interview was conducted with the defendant and questions need to be asked of the interpreter as to that – I take it, it is his interpretation at the time of the interview. This is the second time that has happened to me, where I have had an interpreter questioned about interpretation and I haven’t stopped talking about the first time because it is so unusual, I have to say. … we have got interpreters interpreting for interpreters and so forth. … so today, 30 May, the prosecutor has made an application for adjournment. The recipient of the alleged telephone call or alleged recipient of the alleged telephone calls … had been called to Turkey because her father has a heart condition. She left for Turkey on 11 May and she is due back tonight, 30 May. A subpoena issued for her attendance on 13 May, unfortunately. I cannot help but come to the view that I think the subpoena should have been issued before she left so that appropriate arrangements could have been made by her to be back for today, but the informant is not to know that she was going overseas, but ideally, the subpoena would have issued soon after 24 March rather than mid May, so I mean – as I have already indicated, I mean no criticism of the informant at all.  
         
         
        The prosecutor’s alternate position is that the matter commence today and go over part heard to allow the attendance of the alleged victim, for want of better terminology, but this case has a long history. First before the Court on 10 November. The accused spent two months in custody, just over. The matter has just been listed since 24 March, two and a half. Well over two months for the matter to be ready to proceed today. There are three interpreters present today. Two of those would have to return on another day. There are only two prosecution witnesses to give evidence today. The matter would roughly take an hour, an hour and a half, I think the prosecutor has indicated. … then have to go over part heard. In view of all the material before me, I am of the view – what I’ve asked the prosecutor to outline the allegations. He has done so. In light of all the material – I am of the view I should not grant the application Mr prosecutor for an adjournment.” 
        
       
      
    15 The High Court has examined the issue of the appellate review of a refusal of an adjournment and developed the principles adumbrated by Justice Deane when a member of the Federal Court. In Sali v SPC Limited (1993) 67 ALJR 841 at 843, the High Court (Brennan, Deane and McHugh JJ) said: 
     
      
       
        
        “In  
        Maxwell v Keun 
         [1928] 1 KB 645 at 650, 657, 658 the English Court of Appeal held that, although an appellate court will be slow to interfere with the discretion of the trial judge to refuse an adjournment, it will do so if the refusal will result in a denial of justice to the applicant and the adjournment will not result in any injustice to any other party. That proposition has since become firmly established and has been applied by appellate courts on many occasions. Moreover, the judgment of Atkin LJ in  
        Maxwell 
         has also been taken to establish a further proposition: an adjournment which, if refused, would result in a serious injustice to the applicant should only be refused if that is the only way that justice can be done to another party in the action.” 
        
       
      
    16 Their Honours go on to deal with the concept of case management and the importance of understanding the congestion of court lists. However case management of itself is not a basis upon which an adjournment which renders an injustice to the applicant should be refused. The High Court has said:  
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        Sali v SPC  
        was a case concerning the refusal of an adjournment in relation to which the proper principles of case management may have a particular relevance. However, nothing in that case suggests that those principles might be employed, except perhaps in extreme circumstances, to shut a party out from litigating an issue which is fairly arguable. Case management is not an end in itself. It is an important and useful aid for ensuring the prompt and efficient disposal of litigation. But it ought always to be borne in mind, even in changing times, that the ultimate aim of the court is the attainment of justice and no principle of case management can be allowed to supplant that aim.” ( 
        Queensland v JL Holdings Pty Limited  
        (1997) 189 CLR 146 at 154, per Dawson, Gaudron and McHugh JJ) 
        
       
       
      Adjournment: Criminal Proceedings 
       
      
    17 The above statements of the High Court (and of Deane J when a member of the Federal Court) set out the general principles that apply to an adjournment application. However, in the current circumstances there are different emphases. It is a quite different situation when that which is sought to be adjourned is a criminal prosecution. In a criminal prosecution the factors associated with the “injustice to any other party” or “the only way that justice can be done to another party in the action” (see Sali, supra) take on a far greater significance.  
     
      
    18 Counsel for the plaintiff relies in her submissions on Alexandroaia (1995) 81 A Crim R 286 which applies the reasoning in Maxwell v Keun (and other cases) to the criminal jurisdiction. In that case, the Court of Criminal Appeal (Hunt CJ at CL, Grove and Dunford JJ) said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Whether or not an adjournment should be granted is a matter which lies within the discretion of the trial judge. An appeal based upon the judge’s refusal to grant an adjournment is thus one against the exercise of a discretion, and it will be allowed only where it has been established that the judge has erred in the proper exercise of that discretion. There is a strong presumption in favour of the correctness of the decision, but that presumption will be overcome where it is shown that the judge has acted on some wrong principle, or has given weight to extraneous or irrelevant matters, or has failed to give wait or sufficient weight to relevant considerations, or has made a mistake as to the facts. Even if the precise nature of the error may not be discoverable, it is sufficient that the result was so unreasonable or plainly unjust that the appellant court may infer that there has been a failure properly to exercise that discretion. An appellate court may not, however, substitute its own findings of fact for those of the primary judge unless there was no evidence to support a particular finding, or the evidence is all one way or the judge has misdirected himself in relation to those facts. If the appellate court is satisfied that there has been an injustice to one of the parties as a result of the judge’s exercise of discretion it is under a duty to review the order made.” (at 290) 
        
       
      
    19 Alexandroaia was a judgment concerning an application for an adjournment by an accused. A different balancing exercise arises when the application for adjournment is made by the State: 
     
      
       
        
        “In criminal proceedings, judges are entitled to take into account considerations such as the accused’s right to a hearing of charges brought by the State, without undue delay. Such judges are also entitled to take into account proper and efficient case management, case flow and the demands of other litigation.” ( 
        Blazevski v District Court Judges of New South Wales  
        (1992) 29 ALD 197 at 200) 
        
       
      
    20 Blazevski was also a case in which the accused sought an adjournment because of the unavailability of counsel and the trial judge, according to the Court somewhat peremptorily, refused the adjournment.  
     
      
    21 There are very few instances in the superior courts where consideration has been given to an adjournment application made by the prosecutor. While the principles must be the same, the weighing of justice as between the parties takes on other considerations. One of those considerations, going to the injustice to the accused, is one of the concepts which underpin the principles in double jeopardy.  
     
      
    22 In the instant proceedings, the prosecutor attends the Court below, seeks an adjournment, has the adjournment refused, commences the proceedings and the charges are dismissed against the accused. The plaintiff now seeks for those dismissed proceedings to be reagitated and there are serious aspects to such a course. There will be numerous occasions when, even where there is an error of law in the refusal of an adjournment, an appellate court will exercise its discretion and refuse a remedy.  
     
      
       
      Prosecutor’s Application: Double Jeopardy 
       
      
    23 In circumstances where it is the prosecutor that is seeking an adjournment of proceedings that are otherwise listed for hearing the matter will be, a fortiori, within the discretion of the Magistrate. It will take exceptional circumstances before an appellate court, exercising rights of appeal or prerogative relief, will interfere with such an exercise. 24 In dealing with the issue of double jeopardy the High Court (Pearce v Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610 at 614) cited with approval the judgment of the US Supreme Court in the following passage: 
     
      
       
        
        “If there is a single rationale for the rule or rules that are described as the rule against double jeopardy, it is that described by Black J in  
        Green v United States  
        (1957) 355 US 184 at 187 – 188: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘The underlying idea, one that is deeply ingrained in at least the Anglo-American system of jurisprudence is that the State with all its resources and power should not be allowed to make repeated attempts to convict an individual for an alleged offense, thereby subjecting him to embarrassment, expense and ordeal and compelling him to live in a continuing state of anxiety and insecurity as well as enhancing the possibility that even though innocent he may be found guilty.’ 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        That underlying idea can be seen behind the pleas in bar of autrefois acquit and autrefois convict as well as behind the other forms or manifestations of the rule against double jeopardy. … 
        
       
       
        
        It may be seen as a value which underpins and affects much of the criminal law.” ( 
        Pearce 
         at [10], per McHugh, Hayne and Callinan JJ) 
        
       
      
    25 It cannot be stressed enough that the elements associated with the right of an accused to escape the continuing state of anxiety and insecurity that necessarily accompanies a criminal charge must be paramount in any review by an appellate court of the exercise of discretion to refuse to adjourn. The accused is entitled to expedited justice. It is only in exceptional circumstances that an appellate court will interfere to require such a right to be overtaken by inconvenience associated with the unavailability of a witness.  
     
      
       
      Conclusion 
       
      
    26 However, in the present circumstances, the following situation arises: 
     
      
       
      (a) the unavailability of the witness, who is also the victim, was caused by circumstances beyond her control; 
       
       
      (b) the unavailability was associated with an emergent and urgent illness overseas of a member of her immediate family; 
       
       
      (c) notwithstanding the requirement for her to be overseas, the victim still made attempts to be in attendance at the court; 
       
       
      (d) the uncontroverted material before the Magistrate was that it was impossible for her to return earlier; 
       
       
      (e) the prosecutor had notified the accused prior to the hearing of the fact that they were seeking an adjournment and the reasons for that adjournment;  
       
       
      (f) the accused was not in custody at the time; and 
       
       
      (g) the defendant did not oppose the adjournment.  
       
      
    27 There is little doubt that the effect of the refusal of the adjournment was to deny the prosecutor justice and the opportunity of properly presenting its case. In the exceptional circumstances outlined above, the rights of the accused to a speedy trial do not outweigh the requirement on the Court to provide to the prosecutor a proper opportunity of presenting its case. There is a denial of natural justice and, thereby, a constructive failure to exercise the jurisdiction conferred.  
     
      
    28 The determination that the Magistrate has constructively failed to exercise the jurisdiction has the consequence that the charge has not been dealt with and is still before the Local Court. The jurisdiction of the Local Court, having been enlivened by the laying of the charges, remains undetermined: that is, the constructive failure to exercise jurisdiction left “the jurisdiction in law constructively unexercised”: see MIMA v Bhardwaj (2002) 209 CLR 597 at [53]; ex parte Hebburn Limited v Kearsley Shire Council (1947) 47 SR(NSW) 416 at 420 per Jordan CJ.  
     
      
    29 On that basis, mandamus (or orders in the nature of mandamus) will issue to compel its exercise.  
     
      
    30 Further, the charge (and the status of the defendant) is as it was immediately before the hearing on 30 May 2006. On the view that I take, the defendant/accused is still on bail (or entitled to be). Of course, he could not be punished for any breach of that bail between 30 May 2006 and today. If I am wrong, then I would grant bail forthwith and, for abundant caution, I do so. It is an essential aspect of the discretion that I exercise in quashing the orders that the accused is not, and was not, in custody.  
     
      
    31 Further, I should make clear that the circumstances of the dismissal of these proceedings by the Magistrate and their reinstatement by this Court would undoubtedly have an effect on the accused/defendant and, if he is convicted, should properly be considered to his benefit on sentence. I do not have material that would allow any further comment on that issue; nor is it appropriate.  
     
      
    32 Lastly, I deal with costs. The plaintiff sought an adjournment of the proceedings below. The costs of that day must be borne by the plaintiff. Since it was the plaintiff’s witness’ unavailability that has caused all of this aspect to be litigated, and in circumstances where the defendant did not oppose the adjournment application, the costs of these proceedings also ought be borne by the plaintiff.  
     
      
       
      Orders 
       
      
    33 In the exceptional circumstances of this case, I find that the prosecutor has been denied natural justice and I make the following orders: 
     
      
       
      (a) an order in the nature of  
      certiorari 
      , pursuant to the terms of s69 of the  
      Supreme Court Act 
      , calling up the record of the Local Court sitting in its criminal jurisdiction in proceedings of  
      Police v Gursel Ozakca  
      and the orders of his Honour Magistrate McIntosh of 30 May 2006 refusing an application for adjournment made by the prosecution and dismissing the proceedings; 
       
       
      (b) an order in the nature of  
      certiorari 
       quashing the aforesaid decisions of the learned Magistrate; 
       
       
      (c) a declaration that the jurisdiction of the Magistrate in the aforesaid matter has constructively not been exercised; 
       
       
      (d) an order that the matter be remitted to the Local Court to be dealt with in accordance with law; 
       
       
      (e) an order pursuant to the terms of s28 of the  
      Bail Act 1978 
       that the defendant be granted bail in relation to the charges now pending before the Local Court on the same conditions as previously existed, such conditions to be confirmed within 48 hours of the publication of this judgment; 
       
       
      (f) the plaintiff shall pay the defendant’s costs of the proceedings before the Magistrate of 30 May 2006 and of these proceedings, as agreed or assessed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 SIMPSON J: On 8 August 2005, following a trial by judge alone in the District Court both appellants were convicted on an indictment that charged them jointly in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “That … that [they] on 5 July 2002 at Taree in the State of New South Wales did have in their possession a precursor intended by them for use in the manufacture by them or another person of a prohibited drug.” 
        
       
      
    2 The appellants were duly sentenced. Each now appeals against her conviction. Neither seeks leave to appeal against sentence. 
     
      
    3 The charge was brought under s24A of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 which is relevantly in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “24A Possession of precursors for manufacture or production of prohibited drugs 
         
         
        (1) A person who has possession of a precursor intended by the person for use in the manufacture or production, by that person or another person, of a prohibited drug is guilty of an offence.” 
        
       
       
      A “precursor” is defined as a substance specified or described in regulations made pursuant to the Act as a precursor for the purposes of this section. It was not in issue that the substance the Crown alleged was in the possession of the appellants came within that definition. 
       
      
    4 The facts alleged by the Crown were in relatively narrow compass. The Crown case may be summarised as follows. 
     
      
    5 The appellants are mother (Franklin) and daughter (Jackwitz). Both were resident in Queensland. On 26 June 2002, driving a utility the rear of which was covered with a hard fibreglass canopy, they travelled from Queensland to New South Wales, stopping at various pharmacies. At each of at least 14 pharmacies they purchased, in small quantities, medications, the common element of which was that they contained pseudoephedrine. 
     
      
    6 In a notebook (exhibit G) and diary (exhibit B) either or both of the appellants kept records of their purchases, together with a note of the profit they anticipated making on disposing of the medications. On 5 July 2002 Jackwitz drove the vehicle to a Taree pharmacy. Franklin purchased a packet of sinus and nasal medication. The pharmacist alerted police to the activities of the appellants. Police stopped the vehicle and searched it. In the rear of the utility they found a garbage bag which contained a large number of bubble-packed sheets of packets of medications of three different kinds. In the front of the vehicle they found more of the medications in the glove box. Also in the vehicle was located the notebook and diary mentioned above. 
     
      
    7 In all, the tablets in the possession of the appellants contained 347.1 grams of pseudoephedrine-hydrochloride. 
     
      
    8 Also found in the vehicle were receipts for the medications in the name of Jackwitz. Others were located in the handbags of the two appellants. 
     
      
       
      the trial 
       
      
    9 By notice of motion dated 6 December 2004 each applicant sought an order that the indictment be quashed upon the ground that it was bad for duplicity. Having heard argument on the question, Payne DCJ dismissed the notice of motion, holding that the indictment did not suffer from the defect of duplicity. 
     
      
    10 Evidence was given in the trial by two Taree pharmacists, each of whom asserted that Franklin had entered the pharmacy and purchased medications containing pseudoephedrine. Both, obviously suspicious, reported the purchases to police. It was as a consequence of these notifications that the appellants’ vehicle was stopped and searched. 
     
      
    11 Evidence was also given by various police officers involved, and expert evidence was given by Detective Inspector Willingham; and a statement of a police forensic scientist, Mr William Allender, was tendered. 
     
      
    12 There are two essential elements to the charge under s24A: 
     
      
       
      (i) possession of a precursor; 
       
      (ii) intention that the precursor be used, either by the accused person, or by another person, in the manufacture of a prohibited drug. 
       
      
    13 In relation to Jackwitz, in the circumstances there could have been, and was, no issue as to the first element, of possession, which was conclusively established by the direct evidence. That was not so in relation to Franklin, whose position was that the substance was in the exclusive possession of Jackwitz. The Crown sought to prove the intention of the appellants by circumstantial evidence. The circumstances included the repeated purchases, at different pharmacies in a wide variety of locations, of the medications; the recording in the notebook and diary of the purchases; the recording of the anticipated profit; and the quantity of the substance found in their possession. 
     
      
    14 Neither appellant gave evidence. Jackwitz argued, in effect, that the Crown had failed to establish, beyond reasonable doubt, that her possession (which was not disputed) of the substance was for the relevant purpose. Franklin argued that the Crown had failed to prove that she had possession of the substance. 
     
      
    15 The trial judge, Payne DCJ, declared herself satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the two appellants were part of a joint (criminal) enterprise and were in joint possession of all of the medication found in the vehicle. She held that the only inference available on the evidence was that each appellant intended the precursor to be used in the manufacture of methylamphetamine, either by herself, or by another person. 
     
      
    16 Accordingly, she convicted each of the appellants. 
     
      
       
      grounds of appeal 
       
      
    17 Initially, each appellant pleaded six grounds of appeal. These were in identical terms, as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “1. The conviction of the appellant be quashed upon the ground that the charge upon which she was convicted was bad for duplicity. 
        
       
       
        
        2. The trial judge erred in law in holding that the evidence at the conclusion of the prosecution case disclosed a  
        prima facie 
         case or a case requiring the appellant to be called upon to answer. 
        
       
       
        
        3. The trial judge erred in law in refusing to direct a verdict of acquittal at the conclusion of the prosecution case. 
        
       
       
        
        4. The trial judge erred in law in holding that the evidence was capable of satisfying her, as tribunal of fact, of the guilt of the appellant beyond reasonable doubt. 
        
       
       
        
        5. That the trial judge erred in law in holding that the evidence established the intent of the appellant as charged, viz; possession with intent for use in the manufacture of a prohibited drug. 
        
       
       
        
        6. That the trial judge erred in the exercise of her discretion and the application of s138  
        Evidence Act [1995] 
         by admitting over objection the evidence of the stopping, detention and search of the motor vehicle.” 
        
       
      
    18 On the appeal, each appellant abandoned reliance upon ground 6. Franklin sought and was granted leave to amend the notice of appeal by adding a further ground, in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “7. Error of law in finding that the appellant was in joint possession of a prohibited drug.” 
        
       
       
      ground 1 
       
      
    19 Both at first instance and on appeal the argument put in relation to duplicity focused upon that part of the indictment which asserted possession of the precursor, intended by the appellants: 
     
      
       
        
        “… for use in the manufacture  
        by them or another person 
        ”  
         
        (italics added) 
        
       
       
      of a prohibited drug. 
       
      
    20 The argument advanced was that, in framing s24A as it did, the legislature intended to create at least four different offences: 
     
      
       
      (a) possession of the precursor for the purpose of the manufacture of a prohibited drug by the person in possession; 
       
      (b) possession of a precursor for the purpose of production of a prohibited drug by the person in possession; 
       
      (c) possession of a precursor for the purpose of manufacture of a prohibited drug by a person other than the person in possession; 
       
      (d) possession of a precursor for the purpose of production of a prohibited drug by a person other than the person in possession. 
       
      
    21 Duplicity in an indictment occurs where the charge, as stated, properly construed, charges the accused with having committed two or more separate offences: see Archbold: Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice, 44th Edition (1995), Vol 1, p75, cited in Walsh v Tattersall [1996] HCA 26; 188 CLR 77 at 84. The essence of the appellants’ argument is that, by incorporating in a single charge an allegation that the appellants had possession of the precursor for manufacture of a prohibited drug either by themselves, or by another person, two separate offences were incorporated – that is, the offence of possession for the purpose of manufacture by themselves; and possession of the precursor for the purpose of manufacture of a prohibited drug by some other person. 
     
      
    22 In support of the argument counsel relied upon what was described as an “enlightening” decision of the English Court of Appeal in Mallon v Allen [1964] 1 QB 385, it being submitted (in written submissions) that the effect of that case was that: 
     
      
       
        
        “… where an indictment alleging a person had been ‘permitted or allowed’ to remain on premises was held to be bad, on the basis that two offences were alleged.” 
        
       
      
    23 The submission significantly misstates what was held in that case. The statute there under consideration provided: 
     
      
       
        
        “No person who is apparently under the age of 18 years … shall be admitted to or allowed to remain on those premises …” 
        
       
      
    24 It can readily be seen that that statutory provision clearly created offences of two different characters, constituted by two different acts: admitting a person under the age of 18 years to licensed premises; and allowing a person under the age of 18 years to remain upon licensed premises. The conduct in each case is quite different. In the one case it is admitting a person of the prohibited age into licensed premises; in the other it is allowing a person of relevant age already in the licensed premises to remain there. It is the conduct which is the gist of the offence. 
     
      
    25 Reliance was also placed upon the decision of the High Court in Walsh v Tattersall. In that case, a single charge was brought under a statute which made an offence of obtaining by dishonest means any payment or other benefit under the statute. The defendant, Walsh, was charged with obtaining a series of payments or benefits by dishonest means. The payments or benefits were particularised. 
     
      
    26 It was there argued that the count was bad for duplicity as alleging a number of separate offences. Dawson and Toohey JJ rejected the argument. Their Honours noted that the prosecution case was not of a series of separate dishonest pretences, but that, as a result of, effectively, a single dishonest pretence, Walsh received multiple payments or benefits. The gist of the offence was the act of dishonesty in making a false pretence. 
     
      
    27 Gaudron and Gummow JJ decided the case on what they described as “an anterior question”, and did not deal with the duplicity issue. Kirby J was of the opinion that the count was bad for duplicity. 
     
      
    28 The decision is of only the most marginal relevance. There is nothing in Walsh v Tattersall that throws any light on the present issue. 
     
      
    29 In my opinion the argument advanced on behalf of the appellants must fail. The essential element of the offence charged is possession of the precursor, accompanied by the relevant intention. It is not essential to the proof of that charge that the person in possession have a specific intent as to the identity of the individual or individuals who will manufacture or produce the prohibited drug; that is merely incidental. It may well be that an offender has possession of a precursor with intent that it be made into a prohibited drug without a final intention as to by whom the prohibited drug is to be made. 
     
      
    30 I would reject the first ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      grounds 2, 3, 4 and 5 
       
      
    31 Grounds 2 and 3 are essentially the same ground – that the trial judge was in error in holding that the Crown had established a prima facie case. Ground 4 and 5 are an extension of those grounds, that the evidence was insufficient to establish the guilt of the appellants beyond reasonable doubt. 
     
      
    32 The argument put on behalf of Jackwitz was that the Crown had failed to exclude the possibility that the appellants had purchased the medication for resale for profit, purely as medication. Senior counsel sought to draw comfort from the evidence of the notebook, concerning the anticipated profits. 
     
      
    33 The trial judge drew an inference, from evidence to which I have already referred, that the intention of both appellants was the manufacture of a prohibited drug. In my opinion that inference was amply available to her. Indeed, the alternative inference, proposed on behalf of Jackwitz, is entirely without any foundation in the evidence, and well beyond the bounds of rationality. I am satisfied that her Honour made no error in finding that the Crown had established a prima facie case, in refusing to direct a verdict of acquittal at the conclusion of the prosecution, nor in proceeding to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the intention of the appellants. 
     
      
       
      ground 7: joint possession 
       
      
    34 This ground was advanced only on behalf of Franklin. Reliance was placed on her behalf on R v Amanatidis [2001] NSWCCA 400; R v GNN [2000] SASC 447; and R v Filippetti (1984) 13 A Crim R 335. It may be accepted that, emerging from these authorities, knowledge of the presence of a prohibited substance is not sufficient to establish possession; the Crown must establish that the prohibited substance is not in the exclusive possession of another person; and must establish physical control and an intention to exercise control over it. These are unremarkable propositions. 
     
      
    35 They do not address the issue raised on the evidence. I do not propose to restate that evidence in great detail. Both appellants were present in the vehicle over a number of days. The evidence was that Franklin, on at least two occasions, entered the pharmacies and purchased the substances. It was open to the trial judge to draw an inference, as she did, that the two appellants were party to a joint criminal enterprise. From there it is an obvious inference that they were in joint possession of the substance. 
     
      
    36 I would reject this ground of appeal. 
     
      
    37 Accordingly, I propose that, in each case, the appeal against conviction be dismissed.

    1 MCCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with Hidden J. 
     
      
    2 HIDDEN J: The applicant, Chun Sang Chang, pleaded guilty in the District Court to the following charges: 
     
      
       
        
        (1) Supplying (expressed as offering to supply) a prohibited drug, namely heroin, in an amount not less than the commercial quantity, an offence under s25(2) of the  
        Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act  
        1985 
        , 
         carrying a maximum sentence of 20 years imprisonment; 
        
       
        
       
        
        (2) Being in company with other persons, breaking and entering a dwelling house and committing therein a serious indictable offence, namely intimidating Sung Hyun Kang with intent to cause him to fear physical harm, an offence under s112(2) of the  
        Crimes Act  
        1900, also carrying a maximum sentence of 20 years imprisonment. 
        
       
      
    3 On the first charge, he was sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment for three years from 6 August 2004, the date he was taken into custody. On the second charge he was sentenced to imprisonment for five years, comprising a non-parole period of two years and three months from 6 August 2007 and a balance of term of two years and nine months. It will be seen that the sentence on the second charge was wholly accumulated upon the sentence on the first charge. The overall sentence is imprisonment for eight years with an effective non-parole period of five years and three months. He seeks leave to appeal against those sentences. 
     
      
       
      Facts 
       
      
    4 Briefly stated, the facts of the first charge are that in May 2002 the applicant was the target of a controlled operation. Over a period of days he discussed the supply of heroin with an undercover police officer. From the discussions it appears that he was acting on behalf of a third party. The applicant offered to supply the operative with 350 grams of the drug but, in the event, the transaction did not proceed. The police investigation continued and, apparently, focussed on other targets. As a result, the applicant was not charged with this offence until after 6 August 2004, when he was arrested in respect of the second charge. 
     
      
    5 The background to that second charge was that the victim, a young man aged 16, lived with his father in a house at Berala owned by the applicant’s father-in-law. The victim’s father was the tenant of the premises and was behind with the rent. On the night of 1 August 2004, the applicant went to the house and knocked on the door. The victim, who was at home alone, did not answer it. He was afraid of the applicant because on previous occasions the applicant had yelled at him and his father about unpaid rent.  
     
      
    6 The applicant returned to the house a little later with two other men. He bashed and kicked the front and rear doors of the house, eventually forcing the front door open. He found the victim hiding in the bedroom and demanded to know where his father was. He punched the victim to the head twice. He picked up a pair of scissors from the victim’s desk and wrapped the victim’s jumper around them. He went to the father’s bedroom, then returned to the victim’s room. He again demanded to know where the father was and again punched the victim to the side of his face. He was restrained by one of his companions, who took hold of him by his shirt. Before leaving the premises, he demanded that the outstanding rent be paid and stabbed the scissors into a corridor wall. 
     
      
       
      Subjective Case 
       
      
    7 The applicant is a man in his mid thirties, who has a minor criminal record and whom his Honour saw as a person of general good character. He was raised in Vietnam, one of a large family. When he was 14 years of age, he escaped from that country with his mother and some of his siblings. They spent a year in a refugee camp in Malaysia before coming to this country. The rest of the family arrived here later. He has been married twice and is the father of four children. At the time of sentence he continued to enjoy the support of his second wife and of his parents.  
     
      
    8 He told a psychologist, who provided a report, that he did not use illegal drugs but that he drank to excess and had a gambling problem. He said that his motivation for the drug offence was to raise money to pay accumulated gambling debts. The psychologist assessed his prospects of rehabilitation as good, but recommended that he undertake a course of counselling in relation to anger management, alcohol abuse and gambling. 
     
      
       
      The Application 
       
      
    9 Counsel for the applicant, Mr Jones, argued the application on two bases: 
     
      
      firstly, that his Honour gave insufficient weight to the substantial delay in the prosecution of the charge of supplying the drug and, secondly, that his Honour erred in wholly accumulating the sentence for the second charge upon that for the first, leading to an overall sentence which is manifestly excessive. A ground developed in written submissions that there was unjustified disparity between the applicant’s sentence on the second charge and that of a co-offender was not pressed at the hearing. 
       
       
      Delay 
       
      
    10 As I have said, the offence of supplying the drug was committed in May 2002 but the applicant was not charged with it until August 2004. A further 18 months elapsed until he was sentenced in February 2006, although that appears to be attributable to the normal progress of the matter through the court system, including the fact that the plea of guilty was entered at a late stage. 
     
      
    11 His Honour referred to this matter in his remarks, noting that the applicant’s legal representative before him (who was not Mr Jones) did not submit that the delay between the commission of the offence and the applicant’s arrest should be taken into account in mitigation of sentence. His Honour added, “That is clearly so as the offender was not aware that he was under suspicion from the police until the day of his arrest.” 
     
      
    12 This, it seems to me, is the short answer to Mr Jones’ submission before us. It is appropriate to have regards to the whole of the period between the offence and sentence, but it is significant that the greater part of that period was before the applicant’s arrest. This is not a case, such as R v Todd [1982] 2 NSWLR 517, in which an offender knows he must face sentence but is kept in suspense for a long period because of the operation of the criminal justice system. This is not to deny that there may be cases where a long delay between offence and arrest may be relevant to sentence, for example, where the offender has spent that time in a state of emotional turmoil, fearing exposure and disgrace: see the observations of Allen J in R v Holyoak (1995) 82 A Crim R 502 at 508-9. Nothing of that kind is suggested here. Speaking of delay generally, Allen J said (at 508): 
     
      
       
        
        Whether, in any particular case, …a delay is a detriment depends on the circumstances of that case. There is no rule of law that it always is a detriment – although often it will be. 
        
       
      
    13 Mr Jones did not point to anything in the evidence in the present case to show that the applicant suffered a relevant detriment as a result of the delay. I would reject this ground of the application. 
     
      
       
      Accumulation 
       
      
    14 Mr Jones did not submit that the sentence on each charge, viewed in isolation, is excessive. Rather, he argued that, in ordering that they be served cumulatively, his Honour had failed to have regard to the principle of totality and imposed a total sentence which could fairly be described as crushing. Mr Jones acknowledged that a measure of accumulation was appropriate but he argued that it should have been partial, rather than total.  
     
      
    15 His Honour approached the matter in accordance with the familiar principles expounded in Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610, assessing the appropriate sentence for each offence before considering questions of accumulation or concurrence, as well as totality. He concluded that the sentences should be totally accumulated, noting that the applicant’s legal representative had not argued the contrary. That accumulation was part of his reason for finding special circumstances in the sentence for the second charge, justifying a departure from the usual proportion between a sentence and non-parole period. 
     
      
    16 Mr Jones pointed out that the principle of totality is applicable to the determination of a head sentence, not just a non-parole period: Mill v The Queen (1998) 166 CLR 59 at 66. In submitting that the total sentence and the effective non-parole period are manifestly excessive, he referred not only to the delay in the disposition of the first charge but also to the applicant’s background and character, his favourable prospects of rehabilitation and his pleas of guilty, which his Honour saw as an expression of his remorse. His Honour found that those pleas entitled the applicant to a reduction of sentence “in the order of 15%” for their utilitarian value and added that there should be “some further reduction” for the remorse which they demonstrated, although he did not quantify it.  
     
      
    17 Mr Jones’ concession about the appropriateness of the sentence on each charge, viewed individually, was realistic. His Honour rightly took a serious view of the drug offence, even though no heroin was actually supplied. He described the break and enter offence as “extremely serious”, involving “violence and forcible entry to the victim’s premises” and an “extremely high” degree of intimidation. Making all due allowance for the favourable aspects of the applicant’s subjective case, salutary sentences were called for. The question remains whether, applying the principle of totality, the aggregate sentence is such as to require this Court’s intervention.  
     
      
    18 In all the circumstances, including the applicant’s subjective case, an overall sentence of imprisonment for eight years is severe. Given his Honour’s discount of 15% for the utilitarian value of the pleas of guilty, together with an unquantified additional reduction for remorse, the starting point must have been in the order of ten years. In my view, the aggregate sentence is manifestly excessive. It was open to his Honour to pass wholly cumulative sentences, as the offences were entirely unconnected and separated by a significant period of time. In that event, however, it was necessary to consider whether the principle of totality required some moderation of the sentence appropriate for one or both of them: Johnson v The Queen [2004] HCA 15, 78 ALJR 616, in the joint judgment at [18]ff. With respect, it appears from the sentences which were imposed that his Honour did not undertake this exercise. 
     
      
    19 In my view, the aggregate sentence and the effective non-parole period should each be reduced by one year. Consistently with the trend of authority examined in Johnson, I think it preferable that this be achieved by the partial accumulation of the sentences. Accordingly, I would grant leave to appeal and allow the appeal. I would confirm the sentences passed in the District Court, but would direct that the sentence on the second charge commence on 6 August 2006. The applicant would be eligible for release on parole on 6 November 2008. 
     
      
    20 HISLOP J: I agree with Hidden J.

      2005/1139 Regina v Steven John Berrier 
       
       
       
       
      REMARKS ON SENTENCE 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: The offender, Stephen John Berrier, was tried before me for the murder of Lucas Bruin at Prospect on 19 April 2004. The jury found him not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter. Manslaughter had been left to them on three bases: lack of the intent requisite for murder, excessive self-defence and provocation. Excessive self-defence and provocation were the principal issues, and it is accepted that he should be sentenced on one or other of those bases. Which one, however, is a matter in contest. 
     
      
       
      Facts 
       
      
    2 At the relevant time the offender was in a relationship with Leanne Pearce, and they had a child, Kai. Ms Pearce had previously been in a relationship with one Bradley Flynn, and that relationship had produced a child, Jake. The deceased, Lucas Bruin, was a close friend of Mr Flynn. There had been animosity between the offender and the deceased, apparently as a result of these intertwining relationships. 
     
      
    3 It is not necessary to examine that animosity or the evidence led to demonstrate it. I accept that there had been incidents of abusive or threatening behaviour by the deceased directed at the offender. However, it is of significance that before the killing the deceased became aware of an allegation that the offender had mistreated the child, Jake. The offender had contact with Jake from time to time through his relationship with Ms Pearce. Mr Flynn, the child’s father, was serving a term of imprisonment at the time. It is against this background that the events of 19 April 2004 must be understood.  
     
      
    4 At the time Leanne Pearce was living with her mother at a house near where the killing took place. In the afternoon of 19 April 2004 the offender and Ms Pearce were walking in that general vicinity, with the child, Jake in a pram. The deceased approached and confronted the offender, accusing him of having hit the child. There was a fight, the detail of which need not be examined. It is sufficient to say that the two men exchanged punches. The fight ended and the deceased walked to another house in the vicinity, occupied by the Todd family. 
     
      
    5 Ms Pearce was angry with the deceased for fighting in front of the child and, a little later, she went to the Todds’ house to confront him about the matter. The offender went to the house where Ms Pearce was living and obtained a knife. What happened thereafter was the subject of a great deal of evidence at the trial. The offender stabbed the deceased, wounding him fatally. The course of events leading to the stabbing can be summarised briefly, but attention needs to be given to the evidence about the stabbing itself. 
     
      
    6 The offender approached the Todds’ house. The deceased asked him if he wanted another fight. It seems that he did not see the knife as the offender had it concealed in his sleeve. The deceased picked up a piece of wood and chased the offender. At that time a car driven by the offender’s father turned into the street, and the deceased had to jump clear of its path. The deceased returned to the front of the Todds’ house, and it is the evidence of what then ensued which is in dispute.  
     
      
    7 The offender’s case at the trial was that he had gone to the Todds’ house out of concern for Leanne Pearce, and that he had carried a knife for his own protection because he was fearful of the deceased. He described being chased by the deceased and he said that, after the deceased walked back to the front of the Todds’ house, he also walked to that area. According to him, it was then that the deceased seized a piece of wood, chased him a short distance and swung the piece of wood towards him. He turned towards the deceased and produced the knife, holding it in front of him so as to persuade the deceased to “back off”. The effect of his evidence was that the deceased impaled himself upon the knife.  
     
      
    8 The offender’s evidence raised an issue whether the wounding of the deceased was the result of a voluntary act on his part. Clearly, the jury resolved that issue against him. The question remains whether he should be dealt with substantially upon the basis of his account of the circumstances of the stabbing, accepting it to have been a voluntary act. His counsel, Mr Cook, submitted that he should be sentenced upon the basis that he was acting to defend himself but his response was not reasonable in the circumstances as he perceived them: s421 of the Crimes Act. 
     
      
    9 The Crown prosecutor submitted that I should reject the offender’s account, in the light of eyewitness evidence in the Crown case. The witnesses upon whom the Crown prosecutor relied were all in the immediate vicinity at the time of the stabbing. The effect of their evidence is that the deceased, who had apparently discarded the piece of wood with which he initially chased the offender, was bending down in the front yard of the Todds’ house, trying to break a branch which was lying on the ground. The offender approached him from behind and several of the onlookers called out to the deceased, warning him to look behind him. The deceased turned to face the offender, holding nothing in his hands, and the offender stabbed him. All the witnesses described one or more stabbing actions, although several of them did not see the knife at that moment. 
     
      
    10 The witnesses were Keith Todd, his daughters, Lisa and Kate, Joanne Furner, Cassandra Michie and Timothy Dodds. I did not find Ms Michie and Mr Dodds to be reliable witnesses. Ms Furner was clearly sympathetic to the deceased and, while I would not for one moment criticize her for that, I had reservations about her objectivity. However, the other witnesses, who were acquainted with the deceased but not close to him, impressed me as honest and reliable in essential respects.  
     
      
    11 Mr Cook relied upon the fact that most of the witnesses, including Keith and Kate Todd, described seeing two stabbing motions. Timothy Dodds claimed to have seen three. Only Lisa Todd said that she saw one. In the light of the evidence of the forensic pathologist who examined the deceased, I am satisfied that the knife penetrated his body only once. It may be that the offender thrust the knife towards the deceased twice but only one blow hit its mark. Equally, it may be that all the witnesses except Lisa Todd were mistaken about the number of blows they saw. If that be so, it would not cause me to reject the core of their evidence.  
     
      
    12 Mr Cook also relied upon the fact that the piece of wood described by witnesses as the weapon with which the deceased had initially chased the offender, and described by the offender as that which the deceased had swung at him at the vital moment, was found by police close to the spot where the deceased was stabbed. Mr Cook argued that that is consistent with the offender’s account. That may be so but, in the fast moving event that this incident was, it is not at all clear how that piece of wood came to be where it lay. Its position is not inconsistent with the evidence of the eyewitnesses. 
     
      
    13 The Crown prosecutor submitted that I should sentence the offender on the basis of manslaughter by provocation, rather than excessive self-defence. The issue is by no means academic because counsel were agreed - and I share their view – that, of the two bases, provocation calls for a heavier sentence. I would not sentence him for manslaughter by provocation unless I was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that that is the appropriate basis. I am so satisfied. 
     
      
    14 What emerges consistently from the eyewitness evidence is an account of the stabbing markedly different from that advanced by the offender. I am satisfied that he approached the deceased from behind, that the deceased turned to face him after being warned of his approach, and that the deceased was unarmed at the time he was stabbed. The Crown prosecutor relied upon some other evidence at the trial on this issue, but I do not find it necessary to evaluate it.  
     
      
    15 On the question whether the offender armed himself with the knife for a defensive or aggressive purpose, I am prepared to give him the benefit of the doubt. The Crown prosecutor referred to the evidence of Ms Linda O’Connor that, on an occasion in the early part of 2004, the offender said that he was going to kill the deceased. The offender denied this at the trial but, assuming it was said, I would not give it the significance for which the Crown prosecutor contended. In its context, I am not satisfied that it was a serious threat, rather than a rhetorical flourish. 
     
      
    16 The provocation arose from the background of animosity between him and the deceased, the fight earlier in the afternoon, and the aggression displayed by the deceased in chasing him with a piece of wood. In all likelihood, the deceased was intending to renew his aggression when he was attempting to break off a piece of branch immediately before being stabbed. I accept that the offender had been drinking earlier in the afternoon and was to some extent disinhibited by alcohol.  
     
      
       
      Victim Impact Statement 
       
      
    17 The Crown prosecutor tendered a victim impact statement prepared by the mother of the deceased, Ms Helen Hagenson, speaking for herself and for members of the family. Ms Hagenson read the statement to the Court. I admitted it provisionally, as Mr Cook objected to certain parts of it. However, it is appropriate that the whole statement be received and, of course, I approach it in accordance with established authority.  
     
      
    18 The statement is an eloquent expression of Ms Hagenson’s grief and outrage at the death of her son. That a young man should meet a violent death in circumstances such as these is indeed tragic. At the sentence proceedings I expressed my deepest sympathy to Ms Hagenson and to all who are affected by the loss of Lucas Bruin, and I do so again today.  
     
      
       
      Subjective case 
       
      
    19 The offender was twenty-two years old at the time of the offence and is now twenty-four. He has a minor criminal record, of no significance for present purposes. He has been in custody since his arrest on the day of the killing, 19 April 2004. 
     
      
    20 His mother gave evidence and I received the report of Ms Suzanne Freeman, psychologist. He appears to have had a stable upbringing, although he had learning difficulties and left school during year 9. He had since been steadily employed in unskilled positions.  
     
      
    21 In his late teens he had a relationship with an older woman, which produced a son, Zachary. That woman left him when he was twenty-one, an event which appears to have affected him deeply. The child has remained with his mother. His next relationship was with Leanne Pearce, but that relationship came to an end after he was charged with the present offence. Their son, Kai, is being cared for by the offender’s parents, although Ms Pearce has regular access to him.  
     
      
    22 His mother has been bringing Kai to see him in custody. He told the psychologist, Ms Freeman, that he is devoted to the two boys and that his “main desire” is to be a good father to them. He will live with his parents when he is released. It is hoped that the child, Zachary will then join the household, as there are allegations that he is being mistreated at the home where he now lives.  
     
      
    23 Testing by Ms Freeman disclosed that the offender’s level of intellectual functioning is very low, falling at the upper end of the developmentally disabled range. She described his personality as being of “a prominently paranoid disposition”. He presented as a man of low self-esteem, and she noted that he has a strong need for affection and support from others, and that he feels vulnerable, apprehensive, suspicious and defensive. 
     
      
    24 That personality profile and those intellectual deficits may provide some explanation for his crime. Although I do not understand him to accept his guilt of manslaughter, he expressed remorse for the death of Lucas Bruin to his mother and to Ms Freeman.  
     
      
    25 Ms Freeman recommended individual counselling to address his current level of anxiety, courses in anger management and conflict resolution, and vocational courses to enhance his work skills. She also saw the need for a period of supervision by the Probation and Parole Service upon his release, to assist his adjustment to life in the community. In the light of that material, his age and the fact that this is his first experience of custody, I find special circumstances warranting a departure from the usual proportion between sentence and non-parole period.  
     
      
       
      Sentence 
       
      
    26 I accept that the offender was subject to a significant measure of provocation at the time he stabbed the deceased. In saying that, I do not presume to pass judgment upon the behaviour of the unfortunate deceased. However, the measure of the provocation is relevant to an assessment of the offender’s culpability. As I have said, I am not satisfied that he took possession of the knife to attack the deceased or that the killing was in any way premeditated. It was a reaction to events as they developed in the vicinity of the Todds’ home.  
     
      
    27 Although the fatal blow penetrated the heart, I am not satisfied to the requisite degree that the offender intended to kill. Clearly, he did intend to inflict grievous bodily harm. Nevertheless, the offence remains a serious one of its kind. His intoxication may provide some limited explanation for his behaviour, but it does not mitigate the gravity of his crime. 
     
      
    28 In the offender’s favour, he is a young man with no significant criminal record, who has had the benefit of a stable upbringing and can look forward to the support and assistance of his parents upon his release. His prospects of rehabilitation are good. Indeed, I think it unlikely that he will re-offend. 
     
      
    29 Steven John Berrier, you are sentenced to imprisonment for nine years, comprising a non-parole period of six years, commencing on 19 April 2004 and expiring on 18 April 2010, and a balance of term of three years, commencing on 19 April 2010 and expiring on 18 April 2013. You will be eligible for release on parole on 18 April 2010.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 JAMES J: I agree with Hidden J. 
     
      
    2 HIDDEN J: This is a sad case, with a somewhat unusual history. Kathryn Rose Murphy pleaded guilty in the District Court at Wagga to a charge of ongoing supply of the prohibited drug, amphetamine, an offence under s25A of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985, carrying a maximum sentence of twenty years imprisonment. She asked that nine further charges, including two charges of ongoing supply of prohibited drugs, be taken into account on a Form 1.  
     
      
    3 On 25 August 2006 she was sentenced to imprisonment for two years with a non-parole period of fifteen months, but the sentence was suspended upon her entering into a bond to be of good behaviour and to observe certain conditions. The Director of Public Prosecutions appealed against that sentence on the ground that it is manifestly inadequate, and that appeal was listed for hearing on 20 November 2006. 
     
      
    4 In the meantime, she was found to be in breach of the bond which had been imposed in several respects. On 17 November 2006 the learned sentencing judge revoked the bond, so that she was required to serve the sentence the execution of which had been suspended. In the light of that development, it was foreshadowed in this Court on 20 November 2006 that she might apply for leave to appeal against the sentence originally imposed, and the proceedings were adjourned to 24 November 2006.  
     
      
    5 On that day the Crown prosecutor confirmed that the Director’s appeal was to proceed, notwithstanding that Ms Murphy had by then been committed to custody to serve the sentence which had been suspended. Equally, Mr Odgers SC, for Ms Murphy, confirmed that she wished to pursue an application for leave to appeal against the suspended sentence imposed on 25 August 2006, although it was not in dispute that she was in breach of the bond and its revocation was not challenged. Accordingly, the Crown appeal and Ms Murphy’s application for leave to appeal were heard together. 
     
      
       
      Background and facts 
       
      
    6 Ms Murphy was thirty years old at the time of the offences and is now thirty-one. She has a minor criminal record, which is of no significance and which, in any event, contains no recorded convictions.  
     
      
    7 The youngest in a large family, she had a satisfactory upbringing in the Illawarra area and later in Wagga. She left school after year 9 and undertook a TAFE course, completing a hospitality certificate. She had a good employment record until certain events in 2004, to which I shall refer shortly. She had a relationship with a man, which was marred by domestic violence and by his being imprisoned. The union produced a son, now ten years old, who was living with her mother and her in Wagga at the time of sentence.  
     
      
    8 The relationship finally came to an end in 2004. However, in that same year two more significant events occurred. Her father was gravely ill and on life support. He died in May of that year, after she bore the responsibility of deciding that the life support should be terminated. This, his Honour found, had a profound effect upon her. 
     
      
    9 About two months later she was involved in a motor vehicle accident, suffering significant injuries. She was in hospital for a relatively short period but discharged herself. She was unable to control her pain with prescribed medication. According to the report of a psychiatrist, Dr Yolande Lucire, this is not unknown. She had been a casual user of amphetamine, but she then sought to self-medicate by using the drug more regularly.  
     
      
    10 It was in this context that she became associated with her co-offender, Alan Baxter. She had known him for some years, but she entered into a relationship with him towards the middle of 2005. He was then involved in the supply of amphetamine, and the offences for which she stood for sentence arose from her relationship with him.  
     
      
    11 It is not necessary to recite in detail the facts of the offences. The charge of ongoing supply of amphetamine to which Ms Murphy pleaded guilty involved supply of the drug on ten occasions throughout June 2005. On the first eight occasions she herself supplied the drug, having arranged the transactions by telephone. On the ninth and tenth occasions, both occurring on 30 June, she was a party to a joint criminal enterprise with Mr Baxter to supply the drug. As it happens, the activities of both of them had been under investigation and one of the persons supplied on that occasion was an undercover police officer. The offender supplied the amphetamine in deals of 0.1g for $50.  
     
      
    12 As I have said, there were two further offences of ongoing supply of prohibited drugs on the form 1. The first was the supply of amphetamine on five occasions during May 2005. The second was the supply of amphetamine on four occasions and of cocaine on one occasion during July of that year. As I understand it, on each of those occasions also the amount of drug supplied was small. Also on the form 1 were offences of possessing ammunition without authority, possessing equipment for administering prohibited drugs, and using, possessing and supplying a prohibited drug. All these offences were committed on 27 July 2005, when police conducted a search at the home where she and Mr Baxter were living. She admitted ownership of the ammunition, but his Honour noted that Mr Baxter was a part-time dealer in firearms and inferred that she had no firearms herself. He was satisfied that the ammunition related to firearms under Mr Baxter’s control. She also admitted to possession of a small amount of cannabis, and she was in possession of a bong and a type of coffee grinder used to grind cannabis. She admitted selling small quantities of cannabis to friends occasionally for $20 a deal. His Honour concluded that she was “a very small time dealer” in cannabis and that this activity also was “connected to Mr Baxter’s overarching involvement”.  
     
      
    13 Finally, on the form 1 were offences of possessing a prohibited drug and goods in custody, committed on 24 August 2005. Police found in her possession five small deals of amphetamine, which his Honour accepted were for her personal use. They also found on her $820 in cash, which his Honour found to be proceeds of her drug dealing.  
     
      
       
      Sentencing Judge’s findings 
       
      
    14 Prior to sentencing Ms Murphy, his Honour had dealt with Mr Baxter. He had pleaded guilty to the same principal offence as Ms Murphy and had been sentenced to imprisonment for six years. His Honour saw Mr Baxter as the principal offender and characterised Ms Murphy’s criminality as “significantly lower” than his. His Honour described Mr Baxter as a “hardened criminal”, with “a dreadful criminal history”. He was satisfied that Mr Baxter had exercised “a pervasive and corrosive and corrupt influence” upon Ms Murphy. He concluded: 
     
      
       
        
        I have got absolutely no doubt that but for his influence, the prisoner would not have committed these offences. In fact, but for his association with the prisoner, she would not have become as dependent upon amphetamines as she ultimately did. 
        
       
      
    15 His Honour was also satisfied that Ms Murphy’s involvement in drug dealing, although partly directed to the support of Mr Baxter’s criminal activity, was primarily the result of her need to finance her own use of amphetamine. He found no evidence that she had “any of the trappings of wealth or even of material advantage” resulting from her criminal activity. He considered it fair to categorise her “as a user/supplier who did so in circumstances where her use of amphetamine arose out of her reaction to circumstances beyond her control”. He found that she was “highly dependent upon amphetamine, both to deal with emotional stress and as a consequence of the physical pain she suffered in the motor vehicle accident…”.  
     
      
    16 His Honour allowed a discount of twenty per cent for her plea of guilty. He found that she had shown “some remorse”. He accepted her as a person “of excellent character” prior to her involvement with Mr Baxter. He also accepted that she was unlikely to re-offend, particularly if she could sever her connection with that man. He noted that she and her child had the benefit of the support of her family. On the other hand, he also noted that she had continued to use drugs occasionally during the period she was on bail prior to sentence. As will be seen, this was a matter which influenced one of the conditions which he imposed on the bond under s12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.  
     
      
       
      The Crown appeal 
       
      
    17 His Honour referred to relevant sentencing principles, including the approach to sentence for charges of ongoing supply of drugs and to the taking into account of form 1 matters when passing sentence. In the Director’s appeal, the Crown prosecutor did not suggest any error of principle on his Honour’s part. Nor was issue taken with any of his Honour’s findings of fact. The Crown prosecutor described the twenty per cent discount for the plea of guilty as “generous”, given that it was not an early plea and was entered only after negotiation, but he acknowledged that it was open. 
     
      
    18 Put shortly, the Crown prosecutor’s submission was that the starting point for sentence for the principal offence was too low and failed to give adequate weight to considerations of deterrence, specific and general. Further, he argued that insufficient weight had been given to the criminality of the offences on the form 1, particularly the two offences of ongoing supply.  
     
      
    19 The principal offence was serious, and it was necessary for the sentence to reflect the criminality of the form 1 matters. The sentence which his Honour passed was undoubtedly lenient. However, this was an exceptional case, in which a markedly lenient disposition was entirely appropriate. Ms Murphy’s criminality could be traced directly to her drug dependence, which was itself the product of circumstances beyond her control and could not be fairly said to be her personal choice: cf R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346, per Wood CJ at CL at 397-8 and Simpson J at 410-11. 
     
      
    20 It is unnecessary to repeat the well known principles governing Crown appeals. Relevant to the present case, however, is the oft quoted passage from the judgment of King CJ in The Queen v Osenkowski (1982) 30 SASR 212 at 212-3: 
     
      
       
        
        It is important that prosecution appeals should not be allowed to circumscribe unduly the sentencing discretion of judges. There must always be a place for the exercise of mercy where a judge’s sympathies are reasonably excited by the circumstances of the case. There must always be a place for the leniency which has traditionally been extended even to offenders with bad records when the judge forms the view, almost intuitively in the case of experienced judges, that leniency at that particular stage of the offender’s life might lead to reform. The proper role for prosecution appeals, in my view, is to enable the courts to establish and maintain adequate standards of punishment for crime, to enable idiosyncratic views of individual judges as to particular crimes or types of crime to be corrected, and occasionally to correct a sentence which is so disproportionate to the seriousness of the crime as to shock the public conscience. 
        
       
      
    21 In the unusual circumstances of the present case, I am not persuaded that the sentence, passed by a most experienced sentencing judge, is manifestly inadequate. I would dismiss the Crown appeal.  
     
      
       
      Ms Murphy’s application for leave to appeal 
       
      
    22 A condition of the bond which his Honour directed on 25 August 2006, having suspended the two year sentence, was that Ms Murphy be of good behaviour. A further condition was that she accept the supervision of the Probation and Parole Service and obey all reasonable directions of officers of that Service, particularly regarding drug treatment and counselling. As to that, his Honour recommended that the Service find for her an appropriate residential program to assist her to overcome her drug dependency.  
     
      
    23 Probation and Parole Service reports of October and November 2006 established that on two occasions in September of this year she had failed to attend a pathology service for drug screening urinalysis, and that on 5 October she had failed to report to her probation officer. She did attend for urinalysis on two occasions in October, but the results of each test conveyed that she was still using amphetamine and cannabis.  
     
      
    24 She was, accordingly, in breach of both of the conditions to which I have referred. His Honour revoked the bond pursuant to s99(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. As I have said, the revocation of the bond is not challenged. Ms Murphy seeks leave to appeal against the suspended sentence on the basis that his Honour fell into error in the conditions which he placed upon the bond.  
     
      
    25 Mr Odgers argued that, in the light of her background of drug abuse and the fact that she was continuing to use drugs at the time of sentence, her entry into a residential rehabilitation program should have been made a condition of the bond, rather than simply the subject of a recommendation. As he put it, it was unreasonable to put her back into the community and expect her to cope as matters then stood. His Honour did not have evidence at that time that there was a residential rehabilitation program available for her (although there was by the time she appeared for breach of the bond). That being so, Mr Odgers argued, he should have adjourned the sentence proceedings to ascertain when she could be accepted into such a program. 
     
      
    26 There was no error in his Honour’s approach, which was entirely appropriate in the light of the material before him. Clearly, he was aware of the desirability of a residential program and he fashioned the relevant condition of the bond to accommodate it. He did more than merely recommend her entry into such a program. The condition of the bond imposing Probation and Parole Service supervision was wide enough to empower that Service to require her to enter one, if it were available and were seen to be necessary. His Honour could have done no more.  
     
      
    27 Ms Murphy’s application is without substance and should be refused.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 JAMES J: I agree with Hidden J.  
     
      
    2 HIDDEN J: This is an appeal by the Director of Public Prosecutions against sentences imposed in the District Court upon the respondent, Jay Logan, after he pleaded guilty to the following charges: 
     
      
       
        
         
        (1) Unauthorised possession of a pistol, an offence under s7(1) of the Firearms Act 1996, carrying a maximum sentence of imprisonment for 14 years and a standard non-parole period of three years; 
        
       
       
        
        (2) Breaking and entering a dwelling house with intent to commit therein a serious indictable offence, namely intimidation, an offence under s113(1) of the Crimes Act 1900, carrying a maximum sentence of 10 years. 
         
        
       
      
    3 On the first charge, the respondent was sentenced to imprisonment for two years, comprising of a non-parole period of 14 months and a balance of term of ten months. That sentence was suspended under s12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, upon his entering into a bond to be of good behaviour and to observe certain specified conditions for two years. On the second charge, he was ordered to perform three hundred hours community service. The ground of the Director’s appeal is that those sentences are manifestly inadequate. 
     
      
    4 The learned sentencing judge began his remarks on sentence with the observation that this was “a difficult and unusual case”. Indeed it was. The respondent was 23 years old at the time of the offences, and is now 25. He has no prior convictions of any significance. He left school midway through year 12 and joined the army. He served for about three years, including a tour of duty in East Timor, and was discharged early in 2003. It was during his military service that he met and befriended Owen Van Duren, who was to be his co-offender in the offence of break and enter with intent. Mr Van Duren was to have been sentenced with him, but had absconded. He has since been dealt with. 
     
      
       
      Facts 
       
      
    5 In February 2004, the complainant, John Clancy borrowed $5000 from Mr Van Duren on the pretext that the money was to be invested in a pyramid scheme. When Mr Van Duren attempted to recover the money, Mr Clancy lied to him about when it would be repaid. On 28 May 2004 Mr Van Duren twice went to Mr Clancy’s residence in Queanbeyan and demanded the money, whereupon Mr Clancy called the police.  
     
      
    6 The respondent was working at the time as a security guard at the Canberra Casino. In the morning of 5 June 2004, Mr Van Duren told him that he needed to see Mr Clancy about the money owing, and that Mr Clancy was “a big bloke” and might get “aggro”. He asked the respondent to accompany him and the respondent agreed to.  
     
      
    7 That night, the two men travelled by car to Mr Clancy’s residence. The respondent had a Glock 9mm pistol, which was loaded. They parked in the car park of a nearby motel and got out of the car, wearing balaclavas. They were also carrying handheld radios for communication. They were observed by the manager of the motel, who called the police.  
     
      
    8 They approached Mr Clancy’s residence, an apartment, saw that there were no lights on and concluded that there was no-one inside. Mr Van Duren told the respondent to wait until he came back or called him. The respondent took it that Mr Van Duren was going to break into the apartment and look for the money. In fact, having gained entry to the premises by cutting a hole in the bedroom ceiling, Mr Van Duren cut the interior phone lines and left a threatening note, in the middle of which was a .45 calibre bullet. His Honour accepted that the respondent did not know that this was Mr Van Duren’s intention. As I understand it, the plea of guilty to the charge of break and enter with intent was entered upon the basis that the respondent was a party to a joint criminal enterprise in which it was anticipated that Mr Clancy would be at home and that Mr Van Duren would apply pressure to him in some way to repay the money.  
     
      
    9 In the meantime, the respondent had walked back to the car. He was nervous. He saw police approaching and ran. He was pursued into a nearby driveway, where he was observed speaking into the handheld radio, saying, “It’s off, it’s off.”  
     
      
    10 He was apprehended and searched. Apart from the radio, police found on his person an extendable baton, a number of zip ties in the shape of handcuffs, a roll of black tape and a loaded magazine for the 9mm Glock pistol. He had apparently discarded the loaded pistol itself, because police found it, together with a folding knife, in the surrounding area. His army identification was found in the glove box of the vehicle in which he and Mr Van Duren had driven to the scene. 
     
      
    11 Related offences of possessing ammunition, a prohibited weapon (the baton) and the knife were set out on a certificate under s166 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. For those offences his Honour ordered the respondent to perform one hundred hours community service, concurrently with the order in relation to the charge of break and enter with intent. There was no complaint about this order in the appeal. 
     
      
    12 In March 2003, the respondent had been issued with a firearms licence for rifles, shotguns and pistols in the Australian Capital Territory. However, it transpired that he was not entitled to have a pistol unless he was a member of pistol club and had undergone certain training, despite his army background. In the following month he attended the firearms registry in Canberra and had the pistol category deleted from his licence. His Honour could find no adequate explanation in the evidence of how and when the respondent came into possession of the Glock pistol. However, he accepted that it was carried on the night in question only to be used in self-defence if Mr Clancy became aggressive, and that the respondent believed that no occasion would arise to use it. 
     
      
    13 His Honour assessed the criminality of the episode in this way:  
     
      
       
        
        Except for the fact real weapons were used and a real break-in occurred one could be forgiven for thinking this was an episode from a TV soap opera. How either offender expected to escape detection is baffling as they chose to park their vehicle in a motel car park and the motel manager was naturally curious at his prospective guests behaving in a very odd manner. 
        
       
       
        
        The Crown concedes that Mr Logan’s role was a lookout to ensure Mr Van Duren’s safe retreat from whatever he was doing. What either of them thought might be achieved by all this is difficult to imagine. Whilst there was obviously an element of planning in regard to the event, part of which was conducted as if it was a military operation, it is difficult to see the need for Mr Logan to have gone equipped with the various things that he had on him at the time, except to see it in the nature of him acting out once again being in the army with orders to carry out a vital mission. It all seems to have taken place at a remove from reality. 
        
       
       
      Subjective Case 
       
      
    14 I have already touched upon the respondent’s background. He had a somewhat disturbed upbringing, never having known his natural father and having had a difficult relationship with a violent stepfather. The family moved from Queensland to New South Wales, and finally to the Australian Capital Territory.  
     
      
    15 After a period of adjustment, he settled well into army life and his Honour had before him a number of references to that effect. However, his service in East Timor exposed him to experiences which his Honour described as “harrowing and horrifying”. In addition, a non-commissioned officer required his section to cross the border between East and West Timor whilst on patrol, a course which was inappropriate and possibly illegal. The matter was reported to higher authorities but no action was taken. He was unsettled on his return to Australia and decided to leave the army. After some further difficulties, which need not be recounted, he was honourably discharged. 
     
      
    16 He had difficulty re-adjusting to civilian life and regretted his decision to leave the army. He had a variety of short-term jobs, culminating in the position as a security guard to which I have referred. On the day prior to the offences, he helped to restrain a person at the Casino who was wielding a knife. 
     
      
    17 His Honour had the reports of two psychiatrists, together with the report and oral evidence of a neuro-psychologist. The effect of that material was that the respondent suffered from post traumatic stress disorder and major depression. He had attempted suicide late in 2003. One of the psychiatrists, Dr Jolly, expressed the view that most of the positive things which he had learned, particularly about relationships with others, had been during his military training and associated with it. This, the doctor thought, left him with an “over-valued mateship ideal”, leading to an error of judgment on his part as a result of a request made to him by “his ex-military colleague”. It was clear from the whole of this evidence that the respondent would benefit from appropriate psychotherapy supplemented, if necessary, by medication. 
     
      
    18 By the time he appeared for sentence the respondent had obtained employment with a communications company and his employer, who was aware of these charges, was supportive of him. He had enrolled at the Canberra Institute of Technology to complete his Higher School Certificate, and was making good progress. He was also in what his Honour described as a “supportive relationship” with a young woman, and they planned to marry. 
     
      
    19 In the light of all this material, his Honour expressed his approach to sentence as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        Subjectively speaking I have a young man who has committed two serious offences. He had served with distinction in the Australian military forces in a combat zone. The day before the incident he assisted in restraining a knife wielding assailant in the Canberra Casino. Since his return to civilian life, from the army, almost directly from a combat involvement, he has had significant problems of adjustment and was not offered any debriefing by the Department of Defence. I am satisfied at the time he committed these offences he was deeply depressed as well as suffering from a degree of post traumatic stress disorder. I accept that as a result of the peculiar and necessary bonding and mateship encouraged by the army he felt obliged to help his friend, Mr Van Duren and because of his mental state at the time lacked the full capacity to rationalise his intended actions in the real world. In those circumstances I am not satisfied that there needs to be a substantial element of general deterrence in this particular case.  
        
       
       
      The appeal 
       
      
    20 His Honour considered the standard non-parole period of three years for the firearm offence, referring to the now familiar principles in R v Way (2004) 60 NSWLR 168. He noted that the respondent’s plea of guilty was a sufficient reason to depart from the standard non-parole period, but he also found that the offence fell below the mid-range of objective seriousness of offences of its kind. The Crown prosecutor in this Court challenged that finding.  
     
      
    21 What his Honour said was this: 
     
      
       
        
        In my view Mr Logan’s offending falls well below the midrange for objective seriousness for the firearms offence, although determining that criteria for that particular offence could be quite difficult, principally because there are probably not that many such cases that come before the courts. I accept that when the firearm was obtained the weapon was not intended to be used for an unlawful purpose. However the fact that weapons legitimately obtained can be used for unlawful purposes is the reason why the regulatory regime around weapon possession and use is so stringent. 
        
       
      
    22 The Crown prosecutor submitted that his Honour had misapprehended the evidence about the circumstances in which the respondent came into possession of the Glock pistol. However, as his Honour rightly observed, the evidence about that was confusing and unsatisfactory and, as I have said, he found that the respondent’s possession of the pistol remained unexplained. Certainly, there was no evidence to suggest that he had acquired the weapon for any unlawful purpose, and it was open to his Honour to accept that he had not. 
     
      
    23 The Crown prosecutor pointed out that mere possession of the pistol, whatever the circumstances, was sufficient to constitute the offence. Here, he observed, the respondent had it with him in a public place in circumstances where it might have been fired, if only to defend himself or Mr Van Duren. I can see the force of those observations. As Howie J observed in R v Dang [2005] NSWCCA 430 at [22], whether an offence falls in the mid-range of seriousness “is a matter of judgment on which reasonable minds might differ”, but it is necessary for a sentencing judge to specify the factors which were taken into account in making the assessment. 
     
      
    24 Presumably, his Honour’s determination that the offence fell below the mid-range was based upon his characterisation of both offences in the passages from his remarks which I have quoted above. That includes his Honour’s reference to the respondent’s psychological condition and his finding that “his mental state at the time lacked the full capacity to rationalise his intended actions in the real world”. This led his Honour to conclude that there need not be “a substantial element of general deterrence…”. No doubt, this was a reference to the familiar line of authority dealing with the sentencing of people suffering mental illness to be found in cases such as R v Engert (1995) 84 A Crim R 67.  
     
      
    25 In my view, it was open to his Honour to assess the offence within the range of seriousness as he did. It is apparent from the relevant passage of his remarks that his Honour was well aware of the gravity of an offence of this kind. In any event, the respondent’s plea of guilty and his subjective case provided ample reason to depart from the standard non-parole period.  
     
      
    26 Otherwise, the Crown prosecutor submitted that the two year sentence for the firearm offence is manifestly inadequate, the more so because it was suspended. The same submission was made in respect of the community service order for the break and enter offence. There is no doubt that both sentences are markedly lenient but, in my view, justifiably so. This was a most unusual case. To the features of the case favourable to the respondent to which I have already referred there should be added his Honour’s finding that his prospects of rehabilitation were “excellent” and that there was “little or no chance” of his re-offending.  
     
      
    27 The principles governing Crown appeals are well known and need not be repeated. Also well established is the flexibility of a sentencing judge’s discretion, within the bounds of principle and having regard to the desirability of consistency in sentencing, particularly in exceptional cases where leniency is called for: see, for example, the familiar passage in the judgment of King CJ in The Queen v Osenkowski (1982) 30 SASR 212 at 212-3. Sentencing judges must be free to fashion an exceptional disposition in an exceptional case. This was such a case. 
     
      
    28 I note, in passing, that the respondent has now completed the community service ordered in respect of the break and enter offence. That, however, is by no means determinative of the appeal. I am not persuaded that his Honour fell into error in his reasons or in his disposition of the case. I would dismiss the appeal.  
     
      
    29 HISLOP J: I agree with Hidden J.

    JUDGMENT1 HIS HONOUR: On 14 August 2006 David Williams pleaded not guilty to ten counts of sexual assault, three of those counts were expressed to be in the alternative. A pre-trial voir dire hearing was held on matters not relevant to the present matter.2 On the crown case the offences occurred at the accused’ apartment on a morning of 25 August 2005. The complainant was, at the relevant time, the estranged wife of the accused. The case included allegations of physical violence, actual bodily harm and self manipulation of soft drink bottles into the vagina of the complainant. It must be recognised that the subject matter and the particular nature of the allegations would make such a hearing before a jury a stressful event not only for the complainant but for the accused as well.3 On the second day of the trial counsel for the accused found himself in a situation where he felt compelled to seek leave to withdraw. Among other things he was concerned that symptoms of the accused’ unfitness to be tried were being demonstrated in respect of the accused’ capacity to instruct his legal team. The jury was discharged, a fitness hearing was scheduled. Ultimately that fitness hearing was conducted on 13 December last.4 Although entitled to have the matter heard by a jury I am satisfied the accused was capable of making an election to have the question of his fitness determined by a judge alone, see the report of Dr Allnutt (Exhibit A), and the affidavit of Michael Croak (Exhibit 6). He made such an election (Exhibit 1).5 The accused was represented by Mr Ainsworth of counsel, a member of the New South Wales Bar. The enquiry was conducted in a non-adversarial manner while both parties recognised as a matter of law that neither carried the onus of proving unfitness, the defence sought the ruling. As events transpired forensic experts called by each side gave evidence in support of a finding of unfitness. The Court’s task is to determine whether the accused is unfit to be tried.6 The reason the Court is concerned as to whether an accused is unfit to be tried is because each person coming to be tried on a criminal matter must measure up to certain minimum standards of mental understanding and mental health. To try in a criminal trial an accused who did not reach those minimum standards would result in an intolerable unfairness or injustice to him. As I consider whether the evidence establishes that David Williams is unfit there are a number of matters I am required to assess.7 The starting point for my enquiry is a presumption that the accused is not unfit to be tried therefore his unfitness is a matter that will need to be proved on the balance of probabilities. I also begin by presuming qualified and competent lawyers will legally represent the accused at any trial. The minimum standards I am concerned with are not those needed for an accused to represent himself at the trial.8 An accused will be unfit to be tried where, because of a mental defect, he fails to come up to certain minimum standards which he needs to equal before he can be tried without unfairness or injustice to himself, see R v Presser [1958] VR 45 at 48. The question of an accused’ unfitness to be tried is not limited to unfitness by reason of mental illness or mental disorder and is not to the exclusion of developmental or intellectual disability, R v Mailes (2001) 53 NSWLR 251.The question of unfitness is not determined on the mental state at the time of the alleged offence. His state at that time would not necessarily govern his fitness to be tried at the time of trial. The critical question is to be resolved upon evidence of his state at the time of the trial, R v Dennison (1988) NSWCCA 3 March 1988.9 An accused should be able to understand the nature and alleged circumstances of the charges brought against him, so as to formulate his plea to them. That will depend upon his capacity to understand the nature of the charges. Where there is an inability to understand the nature of the charges, or to remember the circumstances in which the alleged offences are said to have occurred, before a person so afflicted can be found unfit to be tried that inability must be caused by an incapacity arising from a mental defect.10 An inability to remember the circumstances in which an alleged offence is placed because the accused was drunk or under the influence of a drug, for example, would not impact upon that person’s possible unfitness. On the other hand an inability to remember because of a mental condition particularly one affecting his mental faculties would be a relevant consideration.11 An accused should have capacity to determine whether it is in his forensic interest to be tried by a judge sitting alone, assuming the crown should so consent or by a jury. An accused should be capable of sensibly exercising his right to challenge a jury panel member from joining the jury. Challenging a potential juror requires firstly an understanding that each juror participates with others in determining whether the crown has brought sufficient evidence to prove the charges beyond reasonable doubt.12 All this requires that an accused, at least intuitively, base his challenge upon the notion that he will leave on the jury persons he feels are likely to regard his case more favourably and strike off those potential jurors he feels are likely to regard his case less sympathetically. That is to say his choice of jurors should at some level be related to his hoped for outcome of the case and not upon some matter unrelated to the outcome of the trial. Challenging a potential juror requires a capacity to form a view that there may well be something about the appearance or presence of a potential juror to allow an accused to form a view that he would prefer the jury deliberations be made by others not including the challenged jury panel member. Even though the making of challenges can be delegated to counsel it is important that an accused be able to exercise the challenge personally so that in the event he felt the need to do so he could withdraw the delegation or indicate he did not agree with the proposed challenge or non challenge prior to the opportunity to challenge passing.13 An accused should be able to follow the course of proceedings so as to understand what is going on. That is, he will need to understand at some level the proceedings are a formal enquiry conducted usually before a presiding judge and a jury. If there is no jury he will need to understand the judge is the tribunal of both law and fact. He will need to understand the prosecutor is tasked with presenting evidence in support of the crown allegations, that defence counsel is tasked with answering those allegations as best they can be answered. He will understand the tribunal of fact, however constituted, is tasked with determining whether the prosecution has proved from the evidence in the trial the allegations made in the charges.14 In following the course of the proceedings he should be able to follow the evidence. An accused must have at least a rudimentary understanding of the reception of evidence adverse to him, whether orally or by exhibits and the effect of cross-examination. An accused must be capable of giving instructions to his legal representatives, both prior to and during the trial so that his lawyers can properly defend him in the proceedings. He must be able to decide what defence he will rely upon. He must be able to make out that defence, not in the sense of persuading a jury to accept it, but in the sense of articulating it so that his counsel and the court can understand it.15 He must be capable of articulating his defence so that he has a meaningful option to enter the witness box should he choose. Put simply he must be able to make his version of the facts known to both his counsel and the court. This may require some assessment of his capacity to give evidence in chief and to submit to cross-examination. Finally an accused must be able to sustain his participation in the trial for it’s duration. A person will be unfit where one or more of these matters is outside the capacity of the person because of some mental defect.16 In assessing Mr Williams’ fitness to be tried a useful starting point is the conclusion of the aborted trial in August this year. Dr Allnutt reports a history from the accused: 
     
      
       
        
        “Review of the hearing of 17 August 2006 reveals that there were concerns about [the accused’s] ability to concentrate and his use of methylamphetamine. His lawyer noted that under pressure he would become verbose and then have a change of thought process. His family called it “five or ten second delay effect”. He [had] some good days and bad days. A few weeks prior he seemed to his solicitor to be okay but in the days leading up to 17 August 2006 he became more difficult. In addressing the jury the judge stated that he was satisfied that the health issue of one of the participants in the trial was real and genuine and that the concern was his “capacity to concentrate and give instructions.” Some of the pressure and anxiety came from paranoid thoughts “since then he felt frightened to go out”. He stated that “I’m afraid that if I am seen again I’ll get bashed.” He had felt like this more since the time he had been in hospital. He said he was admitted to Randwick Hospital on 18 August. He believed it was the Prince of Wales psychiatric ward where he remained for approximately three weeks. He said that at the time he was feeling “very paranoid about my arrest.” At the time he believed he was going to be arrested. Before he said he had been arrested on several occasions before for breach of bail. At the time of his admission [immediately after the trial] he felt police [were] watching him. He could not embellish on this any further.” Dr Allnutt, page 3. 
        
       
      
    17 Dr Tran also noted: 
     
      
       
      “Mr Williams said that he went to trial on 14 August and the trial was stopped after four days “because of my behaviour”. Mr Williams said that he became “very paranoid” believing that he was going to be arrested outside the courtroom. He was also under the belief that his court case “was going to make the news because of the extent of it”. 
      
    18 Immediately after the jury was discharged it appears David Williams was first admitted to Kiloh Centre, Prince of Wales. Doctor Lee reports: 
     
      
       
      “Mr Williams had two admissions to our inpatient unit this year. The first admission occurred between 17 August and 11 September 2006. At that time he was found to be anxious and paranoid. The provisional diagnosis was psychotic episode. The second admission occurred between 23 October and 12 December 2006. This time his symptoms were characterised by depressed mood and severe anxiety. The diagnosis was a major depression. His treatment includes psychotropic medications and psychological treatment. Since my contact with Mr Williams he has been cooperative in accepting treatment.” 
      
    19 Dr Lee notes that some of the stresses that had impacted upon the accused’s condition included: 
     
      
       
      “...his marriage, business, police arrests and incarceration. In particular the prolonged loss of contact with his son due to AVO restrictions was experienced as traumatic and contributed significantly to his psychopathology. His recovery is further impeded by restrictions of his bail conditions which involved constant supervision by his mother and daily reports to the police. We believe that his prognosis is strongly related to these factors. We would support any endeavours aimed at reducing these legal restrictions.” 
      
    20 Dr Lee’s report is short. Although addressed to the court it does not appear to canvas issues relevant to fitness per se, nor does it include any history of significant poly-drug abuse. It is useful for documenting very recent medical health concerns.21 Dr Allnutt’s opinion as to the state of the accused’s fitness for the first trial is: 
     
      
       
      “In the weeks leading up to the trial on 17 August he began to manifest paranoid ideation which in my view was of a severity that he probably manifested persecutory delusions, ideas of reference and visual hallucinations on the background of an already present depression to the extent that he required admission to a psychiatric hospital. It is probable that the stress of the upcoming trial triggered an acute deterioration in his mental state in the context of any already present depressive syndrome of symptoms characterised by thought blocking or psychomotor retardation (difficulty in formulating thought, slowness of thoughts or absence of thought production). This acute decline in his mental state exacerbated difficulties between himself and his solicitor contributing to difficulty in obtaining instructions on the part of his solicitor.” 
      
    22 The accused’s current condition is assessed by Dr Tran retained by the defence who saw the accused on 8 December 2006: 
     
      
       
      “Mr Williams presented as a casually dressed and medium built male of stated age. He appeared guarded but was otherwise fully cooperative. He maintained a fair degree of eye contact, he appeared somewhat detached and it was difficult to establish rapport. There was no evidence of psychomotor retardation or agitation. There was marked hesitancy of response (this would suggest impaired concentration and/or disorganised though processing)... 
      
     
     
      
      He was oriented to time and place. He was able to attend the interview but appeared to have difficulty concentrating and focussing. No formal cognitive testing was undertaken. He displayed lack of insight in that he did not want to be readmitted even though he was clearly unwell. His judgment and reality testing appeared significantly impaired. He is currently exhibiting psychotic symptoms characterised by persecutory beliefs, disorganised affect and impaired thought processing. His psychotic symptoms appear more prominent than his depressive symptoms. Given the fact that his psychotic symptoms have been persisting, a substance related condition would be unlikely.” 
      
    23 Dr Allnutt saw the accused on 19 October 2006 and again before court on 13 December. Dr Allnutt noted stresors additional to those catalogued by Dr Lee. These related to the death of the accused’s father in November of 2005 and an alleged assault upon him by six aborigines said to be cousins of the complainant. I do not rule out that the claimed relationship of the six aborigines maybe a paranoid ideation.24 He complains of poor quantities and quality of sleep. There are nightmares. He complains of reduced motivation, becoming easily confused, unable to follow the thread of a story and poor concentration. He experiences anxiety that on occasions appears powerful enough to incapacitate him. For example his mother reports that he froze in the car unable to alight from it on one occasion. Dr Allnutt reports a pause for an extended period because of anxiety and the need for Dr Allnutt to change the subject.25 Dr Allnutt reports: 
     
      
       
      “Since leaving the hospital he tended to give only one word answers (according to his mother). He was more socially withdrawn, he wanted other people to make decisions for him, he didn’t want to talk to his lawyer. She said that it appeared that he didn’t want to have input with his lawyer. Before the admission [to hospital] it appeared as if he knew what he was doing but since the admission he appeared to be very hesitant about making decisions including decisions about his legal circumstances. [The mother] acknowledged that the accused continued to take his medication and said that his psychiatrist had diagnosed depression relating to not seeing his son. 
      
    26 Dr Allnutt’s mental state examination is reported as:  
     
      
       
      “The defendant presented as quiet and cooperative. He was well-groomed. His speech was clear and coherent. He was clearly anxious during the interview. His response to questions were frequently delayed. On occasions it appeared that he had lost the thread of his thought, almost as though his thoughts were blocked. He endorsed a depressed mood with neurovegatative symptoms of depression and also some mania in the form of racing thoughts manifesting a mixed presentation. He denied suicidal or homicidal ideation, plan or intent. He gave a prior history of paranoid ideation and in my view continued with a degree of paranoid thinking. On cognitive testing he was reasonably adequate. His capacity for judgment and insight was limited.” 
      
    27 On 13 December Dr Allnutt reviewing Mr Williams made the comments I earlier referred to of his ongoing problems.Presser test assessments28 Dr Tran says: 
     
      
       
      “As regards his charges Mr Williams said that he had been charged with “sexual assault” upon his ex-wife. He confirmed that he had pleaded [not] guilty and as a result had gone to trial before a jury. He thought there were fourteen jurors. He was aware the jury’s role was “to determine if I was guilty or not guilty” but was not sure as to the function of the judge. He said that there were two prosecutors who acted for his ex-wife and the police. When asked about his defence he said, “just my words”.  
      
    The reference to the two prosecutors should be understood to be counsel and the instructing solicitor.”29 Dr Allnutt said: 
     
      
       
      “He understood that he had been charged with sexual assault which he described as rape. He understood that the police had alleged that he had raped his wife. He understood these to be serious charges. Not guilty he understood to mean you did not do that and the consequences of such a finding, release. He understood guilty to mean “that you have done that” and that the consequence of a finding of guilty to be potentially prison. He understood that his lawyer’s role was “to represent myself”, the prosecution “to represent the victim”, the judge to determine who is guilty or not guilty, the jury “they make the decision, members of the public”. He did not spontaneously know what his right of challenge was but he was able to provide an adequate understanding once I explained to him. He understood an oath to mean “when you swear on the Bible and told the truth”. He understood the consequence of failing to do so to be that he would be in trouble. He understood that the purpose of the proceedings was to “determine what’s wrong with me, to find out what happened”. I asked him what the hearing would decide on. He said “to find out if I am guilty or not guilty”. I asked him [whether or not] he had looked at his evidence. He said he had noted that there was some evidence against him and identified photographs that had been taken. He acknowledged that this evidence was relevant because his wife was saying that he had taken them against her will. He also said that there was evidence of a laptop computer with photographs. He was unsure why that was important. I asked him whether or not he had decided on a plea and he said “not guilty”. I asked him what plea he had decided at which point he paused for an extended period of time. When I asked him what he was struggling with at that question he said, “I’m freezing, I’ve got anxiety”. He was unable to provide me with his choice of plea. 
       
       
      It must be stated here that throughout the interview to this point the defendant’s responses were delayed. He was slowed in his speech and tended to thing for periods of time, in excess of that which would be expected, frequently throughout the interview period. 
      
    30 Dr Allnutt described his mental condition in these terms: 
     
      
       
      “Diagnosis is somewhat difficult in this case. While I believe his primary condition is a mood disorder such as a depressive disorder or bipolar affective disorder which psychotic features differential diagnosis would indicate depression with a drug induced psychosis, schizo affective disorder, mixed mood disorder with psychosis. 
      
    31 Other Presser issues raised by the doctor include these: 
     
      
       
      “In my opinion the defendant manifests a mental illness of a nature and severity that could impact upon Presser criteria. 
       
       
      The defendant maintains capacity to understand the nature of what he is charged with. He understood that the police had alleged that he had raped his wife. He has capacity to understand the general nature of the proceedings which is that it is an enquiry into whether he did what he is charged with. He knew the proceedings were to determine what is wrong with me, to find out what happened. I believe he has capacity to elect a trial by judge or by jury. 
       
       
      His capacity to plead to the charge at this stage is compromised. He appears to be ambivalent in his choice of plea. Likely as a consequence of cognitive difficulties derived from his depressive symptoms. He is compromised in his capacity to follow the course of the proceedings. He has difficulty with his thought processes manifesting either a psychomotor retardation through blocking or poverty of thought. These kind of symptoms impairs a persons ability to think properly about things. He is impaired in his capacity to communicate adequately with counsel and to instruct counsel for the purposes for making a defence for similar reasons and he would therefore be limited in his capacity to think through his legal circumstances and to provide his counsel with coherent instructions. While he understands his right of challenge he is extremely anxious and thus might be compromised in his capacity to exercise his right of challenge. Overall I believe that the defendant should be regarded as unfit to stand trial. 
       
       
      Given that his mental condition is of a nature that will respond to medication, that he is currently receiving medication and under psychiatric care, the court should regard his prognosis as fairly good and that he would recover within twelve months.  
      
    32 I am not satisfied any ambivalence in the accused’s approach to his plea has it’s cause in any mental condition he may be experiencing. It is not unusual for those accused of crime to be ambivalent about the plea each may enter. There may be various reasons for that related to matters other than their mental health condition. 33 Nor am I satisfied the accused’s right to challenge is impaired as a consequence of any mental condition he may be experiencing. True his knowledge or memory maybe impaired but I have not been satisfied on the balance of probabilities that such impairment as he has in this area is related to his mental condition. 34 On the other hand, I am concerned that his paranoid ideation has incorporated matters related to the former trial and investigation process, that became manifest in a paranoid ideation of a heightened interest by police in him and an increased potential for his arrest during the course of the trial and related to what was apparently happening in the trial. As I remarked earlier I have not excluded the claim for the six alleged attackers as cousins of the accused to also be a paranoid ideation. 35 I accept that his anxiety and drug induced psychosis and perhaps other mental conditions have compromised his capacity to follow the proceedings, to communicate with his legal advisors and to make a defence that would make clear his version of the events.”36 Putting to one side capacity to plead and capacity to challenge I am prepared to accept Dr Allnutt’s assessment. I regard Dr Lee as supporting Dr Allnutt’s opinion. I am satisfied David Williams is not fit to be tried. I refer him to the Mental Health Review Tribunal. I do intend to vary his bail conditions. I note that the accused is not here.37 The variation in the bail conditions will be the present conditions, coupled with that, he will not take any drugs other than prescribed drugs during the bail period; and that he is to submit to random urine analysis at the discretion of Probation and Parole. That will require him to submit to their supervision for that purpose only. There will also need to be some clarification of his residence. I intend to order copies of this judgment and the reports of Dr Lee, Tran and Allnut to be forwarded to the Mental Health Tribunal. The trial of the accused is to be stood over pending the outcome of the Mental Health Review Tribunal’s review.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 SULLY J: I agree with Howie J. 
     
      
    2 HOWIE J: The applicant and a number of other persons decided to steal a shipping container and its contents of 1,490 DVD players valued at close to $1 million. The container had been shipped to premises where the applicant and his co-offenders worked. The police became aware of the plan and lawfully intercepted telephone calls between various persons over a period from August 2002 until 23 October 2002 when the theft was to take place. The applicant and his co-offenders were arrested and charged with various offences. The applicant became separated from his co-offenders in the criminal justice system so that ultimately he came to be sentenced independently from his co-offenders and by another judge. The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the sentence imposed upon him on a number of grounds of appeal including a complaint of disparity with the sentences imposed upon the others. 
     
      
    3 The applicant initially pleaded guilty to the offence and other charges in the Local Court but was later given leave in the District Court to withdraw those pleas. Eventually the other charges were determined in his favour and the applicant pleaded guilty to the larceny offence. He came to be sentenced before Acting Judge Boulton on 11 November 2005. The co-offenders had been sentenced in November 2004 by Judge Berman SC. The applicant was sentenced on 25 November 2005 to a term of imprisonment of 3 years and 4 months with a non-parole period of 2 years and 6 months. The maximum penalty for an offence of larceny is imprisonment for 5 years. 
     
      
    4 There were five other persons who were charged with offences arising from the police investigation. One of them named Henare was charged with a separate offence of stealing some mobile telephones in November 2001 and was not a co-offender of the applicant. In my opinion his sentence can be disregarded: see R v Araya [2005] NSWCCA 283; R v Singh [2001] NSWCCA 424. Another person named August was charged with receiving but on a very limited basis in that he was prepared to store the DVD players. His sentence gives no guide to whether there is a justifiable sense of grievance arising on the part of the applicant and need not be further considered. 
     
      
    5 The other three persons involved were named Dick, Namana and Baker. Each was charged with the larceny of the DVD players and with other offences including the theft of mobile telephones for which Henare was sentenced. Judge Berman in sentencing each of them purported to apply Pearce so that his Honour specified the appropriate sentence for each offence before considering the issue of totality. Therefore it is reasonable to compare the sentences imposed upon each of those offenders for the larceny with that imposed upon the offender. However, the sentence for the larceny offence for each of the other offenders cannot be considered in isolation, at least so far as the non-parole period is concerned, because there is a practice of reducing the non-parole period when dealing with offences that are to be served cumulatively in order to achieve an appropriate relationship between the overall sentence and the overall non-parole period. 
     
      
       
       
       
      
    6 The sentences for the other offenders were as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Dick 
        : 
         
         
        Offence 1 (Nov 2001): 3 years, npp 2 years from 15/10/04 
         
         
        Offence 2 (July 2002) 3 years, npp 18 months from 15/4/05 
         
         
        Larceny of DVD players 3 years, npp 1 year from 15/10/05 
         
         
        Total: 4 years with non-parole period of 2 years from 15/10/04. 
         
         
        Namana 
        : 
         
         
        Offence 1 (Nov 2001): 3 years, npp 2 years from 1/11/04  
         
         
        Offence 2 (July 2002) 3 years, npp 18 months from 1/5/05 
         
         
        Larceny of DVD players 3 years, npp 1 year from 1/11/05. 
         
         
        Total: 4 years with non-parole period of 2 years from 1/11/04 
         
         
        Baker 
         
         
        Offence 1 (Nov 2001) 2 years, npp 1 year from 12/11/04 
         
         
        Offence 2 (July 2002) 2 years, npp 1 year from 12/3/05 
         
         
        Larceny of DVD players 2 years, npp 9 months from 12/7/05 
         
         
        Total: 2 years 8 months with non-parole period of 1 year 4 months from 12/11/04. 
        
       
      
    7 In each case, when sentencing for the larceny of the DVD players, Judge Berman commenced with a term of 4 years. He discounted it by 25 per cent in the case of Namana and Dick by reason of the utilitarian value of their pleas of guilty and by 50 per cent in the case of Baker by reason of the utilitarian value of his plea and assistance to the authorities. His Honour found special circumstances in each case. 
     
      
    8 In evidence before Acting Judge Boulton were two agreed statements of facts, witness statements and transcripts of conversations recorded by police. His Honour was therefore entitled to find the facts on the basis of all of this material. The Judge had before him the sentencing remarks of Judge Berman that recited the facts as found by him. Acting Judge Boulton was not required to find facts in accordance with the findings of Judge Berman to the extent that the material before Acting Judge Boulton permitted him to come to a separate and independent view. 
     
      
    9 Briefly the statements of facts revealed that the informant to the police was a man named Junior Mekuri who worked in quality control at a container yard at Port Botany. The applicant was a forklift driver at those premises and Dick was a truck driver. On 23 October 2002 there was a container on the premises owned by LG Electronics that contained the DVD players. A few weeks before, the applicant had discussed the arrival of the container with Mekuri. On 23 October the applicant supplied a stolen delivery order for the DVD players to him. Mekuri informed police and a police officer posed as a truck driver to convey the container to another site where it was loaded on to another truck. The container was then taken to Port Kembla where it was unloaded. A short time later the applicant and Dick arrived at the site and were arrested. The police had lawfully intercepted telephone calls that indicated the involvement of these two men and that the theft would occur on that date. In the course of those conversations the applicant discussed with Mekuri supplying him with the delivery order. 
     
      
    10 The agreed statement of facts contained the following: 
     
      
       
        
         
        The Crown case as to the roles of Junior Mekuri and the accused and Arthur Dick are stated in Junior Mekuri’s statement dated 7 October 2003 (namely paragraphs 14 to 23), Junior Mekuri’s version is corroborated by 28 intercepted calls. (see also the previous agreed facts). 
        
       
       
      The statement of Mekuri indicated that the applicant had approached him and said that he had heard about a container that they could get with DVDs. Mekuri stated that the applicant continually asked him if he could organise a driver. Mekuri understood that the applicant was involved with his friend Dick. Eventually Mekuri heard from the applicant that he had the paperwork. According to Mekuri it was the applicant who rang him to tell him what was happening in relation to the theft of the container. 
       
       
      
    11 During the course of his sentencing remarks Acting Judge Boulton stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Police had obtained warrants to intercept telephone conversations between yourself, Mecouri (sic) and Arthur Dick. The documents in the Crown sentence summary contain transcripts of twenty-eight such calls, from late August up to and including the event itself on 23 October 2002. The transcripts are nothing short of damning and I propose to take you and the Court to a few excerpts. They will make it perfectly clear, I trust, that this was a long-standing plan where you and Dick would seem to have been, if not the prime participants, certainly among the prime participants. It would seem that on reading these excerpts that Dick, although an active participant, accepted your say-so on quite a number of occasions and that will emerge from these passages. 
        
       
       
      The Judge then read a number of extracts from the transcripts of telephone calls tendered by the Crown. He then stated; 
       
        
         
        Mr Tatana I have outlined some fragments of the conversations to emphasise that this was no spur of the moment affair. You had a central role in planning and coordinating this larceny, some would call it in modern jargon, a heist………….. 
         
        
       
      
    12 The applicant had one prior conviction being for an assault offence and the Judge treated him as having no relevant prior convictions. There was in evidence a pre-sentence report. This revealed that the applicant was 40 years of age and lived with his partner of 22 years and their two children. The applicant had been in full-time employment until the commission of the offence. The report contained the following: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Mr Tatana claimed that the only part he played in the theft of the containers was to liaise between parties via the phone in order to direct the offenders where to pick up and drop off the container. 
        
       
       
      The Judge indicated that he believed the applicant’s part in the offence was “significantly more important than you were prepared to acknowledge”. 
       
      
    13 Acting Judge Boulton referred to the sentencing remarks of Judge Berman and indicated that he was prepared to accept the same starting point of four years imprisonment. He allowed a discount of 15 per cent for the plea. His Honour was not, however, prepared to find special circumstances as Judge Berman had done. 
     
      
    14 The grounds of appeal are as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        1. The learned sentencing judge did not exercise parity regarding the sentencing of the co-offenders. 
         
         
        2. The learned sentencing judge erred in not finding “special circumstances” in the appellant’s case. 
         
         
        3. Upon all the evidence, it was not open to the sentencing judge to find that the behaviour of the appellant was more serious than that of a co-offender, Mr Dick. 
         
         
        4. The learned sentencing judge’s discretion miscarried and his Honour ought to have accepted that the appellant had shown remorse as expressed through his Counsel. 
         
         
        5. The learned sentencing judge erred in finding that the appellant did not have good prospects of rehabilitation. 
         
        
       
      
    15 Although the first ground of appeal is based upon what is asserted to be disparity between the sentence imposed upon the applicant with those imposed upon his co-offenders, it is more appropriate to first consider the grounds asserting error on the part of the sentencing judge. This is because this Court need only consider the question of parity if there is no error in the exercise of the sentencing discretion. A ground based upon parity assumes that the sentence imposed is otherwise correct. Further the grounds are, with respect, somewhat illogical in the way they have been listed because error found in a later ground of appeal may affect the outcome of an earlier ground. 
     
      
    16 The third ground concerns the Judge’s assessment of the role played by the applicant in comparison with the other co-offenders. His Honour did this by considering the material in evidence before him. The ground is argued, in part at least, based upon the findings made by Judge Berman, but that is an irrelevant consideration because that Judge was making findings based upon the material before him and in relation to the particular offenders whom he was sentencing. A finding of fact by Judge Berman could not bind Acting Judge Boulton. 
     
      
    17 The prosecutor in addressing the Judge said: 
     
      
       
        
         
        I will be submitting Mr Tatana’s involvement is roughly the equivalent of those persons I describe as the bulk, in particular Mr Dick. 
        
       
       
      That submission did not bind the Judge especially as material had been tendered in addition to a statement of facts, precisely so that his Honour could form his own view of the facts. In my opinion it was open to the Judge to determine his own belief of the respective culpability of the applicant vis a vis Dick and the other offenders from his own impression gained after assessing the listening device material. 
       
      
    18 In any event it is difficult to understand the significance of this submission. The judge sentenced the applicant on the basis of the same starting point as Judge Berman did for all offenders, including Dick. A difference in culpability would normally be reflected in a difference in the sentence to the detriment of the more culpable. There is no merit in this ground. 
     
      
    19 The fourth ground of appeal asserts that the Judge erred in not accepting that the applicant showed remorse as expressed through his counsel. The fifth ground is somewhat related in that it asserts that the Judge erred in finding that the applicant did not have good prospects of rehabilitation. During the course of counsel’s address, he said: 
     
      
       
        
         
        ……..As your Honour’s aware, the plea of guilty does a number of things. One of the things it does in my respectful submission to your Honour is that it shows contrition on behalf of Mr Tatana and through me your Honour he expresses that contrition and regret for his actions……. 
        
       
       
      There was no expression of remorse contained in the pre-sentence report. 
       
       
      
    20 The Judge stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        You(r) counsel tells me from the Bar table that you show contrition and regret and refers to your plea of guilty. I have already spoken about the plea of guilty. I can detect in those telephone conversations no sign whatever of conscious or social responsibility. I have read those twenty-eight conversations carefully. You were a man at the time in full time employment. There is no suggestion that the offence was committed out of need. I have no reason whatsoever to take the view that I would be confidant of your rehabilitation. There is no evidence in front of me whatsoever on that score. 
        
       
      
    21 It was acknowledged in written submissions filed for the applicant that the Judge was not obliged to accept what was said from the Bar table, but it was argued that there was nothing before the Judge that pointed to a lack of remorse. This argument misunderstands the onus of proof. It is for the applicant to satisfy the Judge that he is remorseful. The plea of guilty might, but does not necessarily, indicate contrition or remorse. In the present case the Judge found it to be an overwhelming Crown case so that the plea lost its potentiality as evidence of remorse. Further the Judge found that the applicant had attempted to underestimate his criminality to the officer preparing the pre-sentence report. This can be taken as a sign that the applicant is not truly contrite for his criminal conduct. It was well open to the Judge not to be satisfied of the applicant’s remorse. 
     
      
    22 Similarly on the issue of rehabilitation it is for the applicant to satisfy the Judge that he had good prospects of rehabilitation before it can act as a mitigating factor. Contrary to what the ground of appeal asserts, the Judge did not find that the applicant did not have good prospects of rehabilitation. He simply held that he was not satisfied that the applicant had good prospects of rehabilitation: see s 21(3)(h) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. This ground was argued, in part at least, by comparing the situation with the co-offenders. But a sentencing judge is not bound by the findings of another sentencing judge in respect of other offenders. There is no principle of parity in fact finding. 
     
      
    23 In any event a consideration of the prospects of rehabilitation will vary in its importance from case to case. It will assume crucial importance in relation to, say, a young drug addict on an offence of dishonesty. But it can have no significance, say, in sentencing a woman in her seventies on a dangerous driving charge. In the case of a man in his forties with a family including teenage children who was in employment at the time of the offence and who has no apparent issues to be addressed by assistance from the Probation and Parole Service, it seems to me to have minimal significance. This was a case where the applicant saw an opportunity to make a considerable amount of money by being substantially involved in a very significant criminal enterprise requiring planning and the participation of others. It was not an offence committed as a result of some situation personal to the applicant that might be addressed so as to minimise future offending of a similar type. Apart from the personal deterrent factor arising from his being imprisoned, there was nothing to indicate that the applicant would not take a similar opportunity if it again presented itself. The fact that the Judge was not satisfied that the applicant was remorseful tended against a positive finding of his prospects of rehabilitation. 
     
      
    24 There is no substance in either of these grounds. 
     
      
    25 The second ground asserts that the Judge was in error in not finding special circumstances. Again the argument proceeds generally from a consideration of the findings made by Judge Berman and a submission that had his Honour sentenced the applicant he would have found special circumstances. This is irrelevant to this ground of appeal. Acting Judge Boulton was making a finding of fact and he was not bound by any finding made by Judge Berman. There will be many cases where judges might differ as to whether they would make a finding of special circumstances given that the same material was placed before them. It is largely an intuitive determination. As long as the finding was open to the sentencing judge it is not for this Court to interfere. 
     
      
    26 In any event Judge Berman found special circumstances on the basis that it was the first time in custody for each of the offenders before him and that they could benefit from supervision by the Probation and Parole Service. In the case of the applicant the only basis open for a finding of special circumstances was that it was his first time in custody. The applicant’s pre-sentence report indicated that there was no issue to be addressed by the Service. This was a case where the Judge could easily have determined to impose a fixed term because there was nothing to be achieved by a period on parole. 
     
      
    27 There was no error in Acting Judge Boulton finding that there were no special circumstances for the purpose of s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. The ground has no merit. 
     
      
    28 That leaves a consideration of the issue of parity between the applicant and the co-offenders. This is a ground where there are considerable obstacles placed before the applicant in circumstances where the sentencing judge is fully aware of sentences imposed upon co-offenders, the reasons for those sentences, and in the remarks indicates why the judge is departing from the sentences imposed upon the others. Those obstacles became even greater where, as here, the difference is a result of legitimate fact finding on the part of the second judge. 
     
      
    29 There can, in my opinion, be no complaint about the head sentence imposed. The difference is attributable to the fact that the applicant justifiably received a lesser discount for the utilitarian value of his plea of guilty. This Court has considered the relevance of parity to the fixing of a non-parole period on more than one occasion. In R v Do [2005] NSWCCA 209, the Court stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        17 It is further submitted that disparity arises from the fact that, because his Honour failed to find special circumstances in the case of the applicant but did so in the case of his brother, the resulting non-parole periods are so disparate that the applicant has a justifiable sense of grievance that should be addressed by this Court. Reliance is placed in this regard on what was said by Simpson J in R v Bell [1999] NSWCCA 423. It is submitted that this decision is authority for the proposition that disparity can arise between the sentences imposed upon co-offenders simply because of a finding of special circumstances in one case but not in the other.  
         
         
        18 Bell was considered by this Court in R v Wahabzadah [2001] NSWCCA 253. That was a case, like Bell, where the Court was constituted by two judges and, therefore, is not authority on matters of principle. In Wahabzadah the Court was constituted by Wood CJ at CL and myself. The applicant had relied upon Bell and the decision in R v Muavae [2000] NSWCCA 88 as supporting a similar argument as that raised in the present proceedings. During the course of my judgment, with which the Chief Judge at Common Law expressed his agreement, I stated: 
         
         
          
          15 While I accept, as I must do, that the principle of parity applies in all aspects of a sentence, including the non-parole period, the principle is concerned with ameliorating a justifiable sense of grievance on the part of the offender. If a disparity is occasioned by the operation of the law, there can be no justifiable sense of grievance arising simply because a proper application of the law in two different cases has given two different results. Specifically, s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act mandates that a non-parole period be not less than three-quarters of the term of the sentence unless there are special circumstances for it being less. I do not believe that there is any breach of the principle of parity, simply because different non-parole periods are specified for different co-offenders because of different findings as to the existence, or extent, of special circumstances. 
          
         
         
          
          16 There is nothing in either Lowe v The Queen (1984) 154 CLR 606 or Postiglioni v The Queen (1997) 189 CLR 295 to suggest otherwise. Quite the contrary, in the latter case even the majority of the High Court were of the view that there was no disparity by reason of the different non-parole periods specified between the two offenders. Disparity only arises when the difference between the two sentences cannot be justified by a difference in the degree of the culpability of the offenders or in their personal circumstances. A difference in a finding as to whether special circumstances exist is a difference in a finding as to the personal circumstances of the co-offenders, and, if justified on the material before the sentencing judge, there can be no basis in my view upon which any sense of injustice can arise either in the collective mind of the community or in the individual mind of a co-offender. 
          
         
         
          
          17 It was submitted, on behalf of the applicant, that two decisions of this Court authorise appellate intervention where there is a disparity resulting from a difference in the finding of special circumstances even if the difference in the findings were justified. In my view, neither of those decisions are authority for such a proposition, but, if they were, I would not be prepared to follow them. But in both R v Bell [1999] NSWCCA 423 and R v Muavae [2000] NSWCCA 88 this Court only held that the personal circumstances of the appellant required a finding that special circumstances existed and the failure of the sentencing judge to do so was an error. In each case the disparity in the minimum terms of the sentences imposed upon the appellant and the co-offender simply highlighted the error that had been made. 
          
         
         
        19 I maintain the view that I expressed in those passages that generally disparity does not arise simply from the fact that a finding of special circumstances was made in respect of one co-offender but not in respect of the other. I am prepared to accept that there may be a case where, all relevant facts and circumstances being equal, a finding of special circumstances in the case of one offender but not in the other may give rise to a justifiable sense of grievance. But in the present case not all things were equal because of the different findings made in respect of the criminality of the two offenders and the appropriate head sentences. 
        
       
      
    30 It seems to me advisable for a judge placed in the position of Acting Judge Boulton to consider whether in the circumstances regard should be had to the findings of the judge dealing with co-offenders for reasons of comity and fairness. There may be a case where either the second sentencing judge or this Court feels constrained not to depart from a finding made by an earlier judge in order to ensure that a justifiable sense of grievance does not arise on the basis that there is no appreciable difference between the cases presented by two co-offenders and yet the results are markedly different. 
     
      
    31 As has already been noted, there was no error in his Honour’s failure to find special circumstances. The case as presented by the applicant was different from that presented to Judge Berman by the co-offenders. Much of the argument in the written submissions is concerned with Henare, who was not a co-offender, or August, who was sentenced for a different offence with a very limited degree of criminality. No legitimate sense of grievance can arise from the sentences passed upon those two offenders.  
     
      
    32 However, at the end of the day the applicant is to spend six months longer in custody before being released to parole notwithstanding that he was sentenced for less criminal activity than his co-offenders. That is on the face of it a somewhat surprising and troubling outcome. It cannot be explained other than by a failure on the part of Acting Judge Boulton to find remorse or that the applicant had good prospects of rehabilitation. To that extent there was a difference between the applicant and the co-offenders. But to my mind that difference could not warrant the applicant being required to serve a substantially longer period in custody than persons who had committed significantly more crime. 
     
      
    33 It seems to me that a permissible means of avoiding this unacceptable situation would have been for Acting Judge Boulton, when confronted with that result, to have considered whether the need to preserve a proper parity with the co-offenders itself gave rise to special circumstances justifying a reduction in the non-parole period. Although matters giving rise to special circumstances for the purposes of s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 will be, generally speaking, subjective considerations personal to the particular offender, they are not limited to such factors. As has already been noted, special circumstances may be found when sentences are being made cumulative in order to retain an appropriate ratio between the overall term and the overall non-parole period. In my opinion, the need in a particular case to preserve proper parity between co-offenders may itself amount to special circumstances enabling a principled avoidance of a situation of manifest unfairness arising from a too literal application of conventional sentencing principles and the requirements of s 44. Such a use of the concept of special circumstances will need, always, to be justified by the special requirements in a particular sentencing context. 
     
      
    34 This is not to suggest that disparity will generally arise simply because the application of s 44 to particular offenders has resulted in different sentences between co-offenders: Do is against that proposition. But this is an exceptional case where the subjective factors favourable to the co-offenders were insufficient to justify the fact that the applicant would spend longer in custody even though he was being sentenced for significantly less criminality. In the end it is a matter of degree and balance. The applicant clearly has a justifiable sense of grievance with the outcome of the two different sentencing proceedings. In order to avoid that outcome Acting Judge Boulton ought to have found that parity with the co-offenders amounted to special circumstances justifying a reduction in the otherwise appropriate non-parole period. However, proper sentencing principles and the findings made by Acting Judge Boulton limit the extent to which the non-parole period can be reduced to address parity. 
     
      
    35 I propose that leave be granted and the appeal be allowed so far as the non-parole period is concerned. The non-parole period specified by Acting Judge Boulton should be quashed and in lieu a non-parole period is specified of 1 year and 9 months to commence on 28 October 2005 and to expire on 27 July 2007 the day upon which the applicant is eligible to be released to parole. 
     
      
    36 LATHAM J: I agree with Howie J.

      JUDGMENT - Application to restrain counsel and solicitor 
       
      (Applicant – Commonwealth of Australia: Respondents – Messrs Lange & Houda) 
       
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: This is the hearing of a Motion brought on behalf of the Commonwealth of Australia. The applicant has sought the following orders: - 
     
      
       
        
        “1. Peter Lange and Adam Houda be restrained from further representing or acting for the accused Belal Khazaal in these proceedings;  
        
       
       
        
        2. Peter Lange and Adam Houda be prohibited from: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          2.1 disclosing any information contained in the document entitled Affidavit for a warrant to search premises produced by the NSW Local Court pursuant to a subpoena issued on 20 April 2006 in these Proceedings (“the Affidavit”) to any person whatsoever, including to other legal representatives for Mr Khazaal or to any persons assisting those representatives; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          2.2 using the information contained in the Affidavit for any purpose whatsoever, including using it either expressly or implicitly in the preparation of argument or the drafting of submissions; and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          2.3 copying, recording or reproducing the information contained in the Affidavit in any form whatsoever. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        3. Any other orders that the Court thinks appropriate.” 
        
       
      
    2 For convenience, I will refer in this judgment to the applicant as “the Commonwealth”. I shall refer to Messrs Lange and Houda as “the Respondents” where I am mentioning them jointly. I shall, however, refer to them by name when discussing them in an individual capacity. 
     
      
    3 On the hearing of the motion, the Commonwealth was represented by Mr Willee QC and Mr Begbie of junior counsel. The accused was represented by Mr Lange instructed by Mr Houda. The Crown was represented by Mr G. Bellew SC. The respondents were each represented by separate counsel. Mr Boulten SC appeared for Peter Lange. Mr Gageler SC and Mr Kirk appeared for Adam Houda.  
     
      
    4 I granted leave to Mr Leeming SC to appear on a provisional basis for the New South Wales Bar Association and the Law Society of New South Wales. 
     
      
       
      The general background 
       
      
    5 It may be helpful if I say something as to the general background to explain the way in which the present application arises. On 2 September 2005, Mr Khazaal pleaded not guilty to two charges: the first was a charge that he made a document between 20 and 23 September 2003, namely, a book, connected with preparation for, the engagement of a person in, or assistance in a terrorist act, knowing of that connection. The second charge was that between 22 September 2003 and May 2004, the accused incited the commission by others of an offence, namely an offence of engaging in a terrorist act, contrary to s 101 of the Criminal Code.  
     
      
    6 Adam Houda is the solicitor for Mr Khazaal in the trial. Mr Peter Lange is junior counsel briefed to appear on behalf of Mr Khazaal at his trial.  
     
      
    7 In 2004, the Australian Federal Police (“AFP”) took part in an investigation into the activities of the accused. It was this investigation that resulted in the accused being charged with the two offences for which he is to stand trial. On 5 May 2004, an affidavit for a warrant to search premises was sworn by Federal Agent Benjamin Bynon of the AFP. The Warrant Affidavit, as I shall call it, sought the issue of a search warrant to enable a search of premises at 17 Wangee Road, Lakemba. It extended also to the search of a motor vehicle YBL-609. The Warrant Affidavit was provided to the Downing Centre Local Court of New South Wales and a search warrant was issued. As I understand it, the search warrant was executed by the police and certain documents and material were seized. 
     
      
    8 According to Deputy Commissioner Lawler, the Warrant Affidavit was originally retained in a sealed envelope bearing, as I understand it, official AFP document seals. Initially, it was retained by the Downing Centre Local Court. On 20 April 2006, however, a subpoena was issued out of the Supreme Court of New South Wales on behalf of the accused. It was as a result of this subpoena that the Downing Centre Local Court produced to the Registry of the Supreme Court a copy of the Warrant Affidavit. (There is no explanation as to why a copy was produced or as to where the original may now be found). The document seems to have been produced in an unmarked envelope. On 3 May 2006 Kirby J, who had been designated as the trial Judge in the matter, made an order permitting inspection of the Warrant Affidavit by the respondents. They did so in their capacity as junior counsel and instructing solicitor respectively for the accused. His Honour no doubt assumed, as is commonly the case, that the access sought was general and unopposed. It appears that no one brought to the Judge’s attention that the material to be inspected might contain confidential matters. 
     
      
    9 As I understand it, the Warrant Affidavit was then inspected in the Supreme Court Registry by Mr Lange at a time when he was accompanied by Mr Houda. There is no need for me, at this point, to go to the details of the circumstances surrounding the inspection. It is sufficient to say that those facts and circumstances, whatever be their content, comprise the basis of the present application that has been made on behalf of the Commonwealth seeking to exclude the respondents as legal representatives of the accused at his trial. 
     
      
       
      An overview of the arguments advanced on behalf of the Commonwealth 
       
      
    10 Let me, at the outset, put the arguments of the Commonwealth in very general terms. I do this so that the nature of the proceedings will be properly revealed. 
     
      
    11 The platform for the Commonwealth’s application is the proposition that the material in the Warrant Affidavit is requiring of protection. That this is so arises from the confidential affidavits of the Director-General of Security and the Deputy Commissioner of the AFP. These are exhibits in these proceedings, as they were in an earlier motion brought by the present respondents seeking access for their legal representatives to the Warrant Affidavit and the confidential affidavits. There is no doubt that, in general terms, this aspect of the Commonwealth’s argument in the present application is well founded. There is no need for me to repeat the detailed reasons I gave in my decision of 25 October 2006. In that decision, I made an assessment of the National Security sensitivity of the information in the Warrant Affidavit and, as a consequence, refused access to the legal representatives. Not all the information in the Warrant Affidavit, however, is security sensitive to an equal degree. Obviously, some matters are much more significantly related to national security than others. As will later appear, I shall have to make some value judgments in this regard. For the moment however, I am content to say that, in general terms, the material in the Warrant Affidavit demands protection to a substantial degree. Indeed, although the legal representatives for the respondents were not given access to the material, they accepted for the purposes of the present application that this was likely to be so.  
     
      
    12 I should mention for completeness that Mr Burbidge QC and Mr Sheller appeared at the outset of the application for Mr Lange, although they later withdrew from the proceedings. They informed me that an appeal had been lodged against my previous decision of 25 October 2006. Whether there is an intention to proceed with the appeal is not known to me. It was my view that the present application should proceed and I declined to grant Mr Burbidge QC an adjournment. It was at that stage that he and Mr Sheller withdrew from the proceedings. Mr Lange was fortunate that, shortly afterwards, experienced counsel, Mr Boulten SC, accepted a brief to appear on his behalf and subsequently appeared throughout the hearing of the motion. Mr Boulten SC did not renew any application for an adjournment or seek a stay of the present application. 
     
      
    13 As I have said, the Commonwealth’s case rests upon the premise that there is a clear need to protect the information in the Warrant Affidavit. The Commonwealth, in that context, put two major arguments: first, the need to protect the national security information is at such a high level that the undertakings which have been given by the respondents (and other undertakings they have proffered to the Court) will not be sufficient to protect the situation. This first argument, in turn, raises the spectre of inadvertent disclosure. It focuses also upon the question whether the respondents have sufficient appreciation of their obligations to the Court, the Commonwealth and the public in relation to national security information so that the undertakings may be considered to be of sufficient integrity. Secondly, the Commonwealth argues that there is a need to protect the integrity of the judicial process. It submitted that the respondents have seriously failed to exercise the necessary caution and vigilance in relation to the access they obtained to the Warrant Affidavit; and that this was so to such an extent that a fair-minded reasonably informed member of the public would conclude that the proper administration of justice requires that each be restrained from further acting in the trial of the accused. 
     
      
       
      Undertakings given and orders made by the Court to protect confidentiality of sensitive material 
       
      
    14 Immediately after the Warrant Affidavit material had been inspected in the Supreme Court Registry, undertakings were sought from the respondents to protect the information from further disclosure. On 4 May 2006 written undertakings were given in the following terms: - 
     
      
       
        
        “Until further order of the Court you will not -  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) disclose any information contained in the Affidavit to any person whatsoever, including to Mr Khazaal or to other legal representatives for Mr Khazaal, or to any persons assisting those representatives;  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) use the information either directly or indirectly for any purpose whatsoever, including using it either expressly or implicitly in the preparation of argument or the drafting of submissions; and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) copy, record or reproduce the information contained in the Affidavit in any form whatsoever.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    15 The matter was then listed before Kirby J on Friday, 5 May 2006 at 9.30am. This brief hearing resulted in the Court making a number of orders. There was no opposition, in general terms, to the orders that were made. Those orders were as follows: -  
     
      
       
        
        “I make the following orders: 
        
       
       
        
        1. Until further order Peter Lange and Adam Houda be prohibited from: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) disclosing any information contained in the document entitled Affidavit for a warrant to search premises produced by the NSW Local Court pursuant to a subpoena issued on 20 April 2006 in these Proceedings (“the Affidavit”) to any person whatsoever, including to other legal representatives for Mr Khazaal or to any persons assisting those representatives; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) using the information contained in the Affidavit for any purpose whatsoever, including using it either expressly or implicitly in the preparation of argument or the drafting of submissions; and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) copying, recording or reproducing the information contained in the Affidavit in any form whatsoever. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        2. The pre-trial application listed on 11 May 2006 is vacated. 
        
       
       
        
        3. Matter to be listed for mention before Kirby J at 9.30am on Friday 26 May 2006. 
        
       
       
        
        4. The Affidavit subpoenaed from the NSW Local Court be: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) placed in a sealed envelope marked “Not to be opened except by Order of Justice Kirby” 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) stored in a B-class safe; and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) accessed only by Justice Kirby,” 
          
         
        
       
      
    16 The undertakings given inter-partes, and the orders made by Justice Kirby, have been in force since May 2006. There is no suggestion that there has been any breach of or departure from the terms of those undertakings and orders. For completeness sake, I should mention that each respondent has, through his counsel, proffered undertakings to this Court, in addition to the undertakings given to the Commonwealth. 
     
      
       
      Principles of law applicable to the issues 
       
      
    17 The principles of law applicable to the resolution of the issue in the present matter are not in issue. It will be sufficient if I state those principles briefly:- 
     
      
       
      (a)  
      The protection of national security information 
       
      
    18 There is no doubt that national security forms a category of public interest of special importance (Alister v R (1984) 154 CLR 404 at 436). Documents concerning defence secrets (and diplomatic relationships with foreign governments) are regarded as archetypes of public interest immunity claims (Sankey v Whitlam (1978) 142 CLR 1 at 57). See also my decision in R v Khazaal [2006] NSWSC 1061 25 October 2006 at [paras 29 to 32] as to the general importance of protecting national security information. 
     
      
       
      (b)  
      Undertakings 
       
      
    19 The undertakings which have been given, and those which have been proffered by each of the respondents before me, are important in the assessment of the issue as to whether the relief claimed by the Commonwealth in these proceedings is necessary. It will be recalled that these proceedings relate to the Court’s inherent power and jurisdiction to protect confidential information and to ensure the integrity of the judicial process. It is no part of this application that the Court is, in any way, exercising the Supreme Court’s inherent disciplinary jurisdiction and powers. Indeed, although issues of professional integrity arise indirectly, this is not a matter where, strictly speaking, there is any need to ascertain whether there has been professional misconduct or unsatisfactory professional conduct. There is a statutory scheme for investigating and disciplining legal practitioners. There is as well a specialist tribunal and well-defined roles for the Legal Services Commissioner and professional bodies (Barwick v The Law Society NSW [2000] 74 ALJR 419 at 11 to 13 and 32 to 64). Secondly, the inherent disciplinary power of the Court is allocated to the Court of Appeal: Part 65A Rule 2(1); Smyrnis v Legal Practitioners Board [2003] NSWCA 64 at [16].  
     
      
    20 An undertaking given to the Court is equivalent to an injunction. Observance of it may be enforced in the same way as an injunction is enforced. In New South Wales, a motion for attachment has for long been the process adopted against an individual who disobeys an injunction or breaks his undertaking (Australian Consolidated Press Limited v Morgan & Anor (1965) 112 CLR 483 at 496 per Windeyer J). 
     
      
    21 In circumstances where it is necessary to consider the effect of formal undertakings having been given, it is also appropriate to note that Equity will not grant relief which is lacking in utility. Cowper LC said in Selly v Jago (1717) 1 P Wms 389 [24 ER 438] that: - 
     
      
       
        
        “Equity like nature, will do nothing in vain”. 
        
       
      
    22 For modern instances, see Scarel Pty Limited v City Loan & Credit Pty Limited (1998) 17 FCR 344 at 348 (Gummow J); Forest View Nominees Pty Limited v Perpetual Trustees Pty Limited (1998) 193 CLR 154 at [16]; Lest We Forget Pty Limited v Westpac Banking Corporation [2005] 565 ACSR 126 at [20] per Barrett J. 
     
      
       
      (c)  
      The accused’s right to legal representation of his choice 
       
      
    23 As Mr Leeming SC submitted, the right to representation of one’s choice, in the case of a barrister, may be seen as a complement of the “cab rank” rule, whose importance is undoubted: see Rondell v Worsley (1969) 1 AC 191 at 274; D’Orta-Ekenaike v Victoria Legal Aid [2005] 79 ALJR 755 at [27]; Dietrich v The Queen (1992) 177 CLR 292 at 317. 
     
      
    24 In Emanuele v Emanuele Investments (1996) 21 ACSR 83 at 107, Debelle J said: - 
     
      
       
        
        “It is a very serious step to deprive a party of the counsel of his choice”. 
        
       
      
    25 More recently, in Franklin River Olive Company Limited v Charters Securities Pty Limited [2004] WASC 88 at [25-26], Pullin J said: - 
     
      
       
        
        “It is undoubtedly a serious step to deprive a party of counsel or solicitors of that party’s choice…While it is a serious step to deprive a party of counsel and solicitor of choice, the Court will do so, if necessary.” 
        
       
      
    26 These two authorities were concerned with civil litigation. See also the decision of Mandie J in Grimwade v Meagher, & Ors (1995) 1 VR 446 at 450 and 455. In the rather unusual circumstances of that case, the application for an injunction was allowed. The Judge however, emphasised the “unique, extraordinary and highly exceptional circumstances” of the case. 
     
      
    27 The right to selection of legal representation of one’s choice in criminal proceedings is equally fundamental and important. The right is reflected, for example, in Art 14(3)(d) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The importance to the process of the administration of justice of the right of an accused person to retain his or her own counsel was emphasised earlier this year by the United States Supreme Court. This involved a decision on the Sixth Amendment right “to have the assistance of counsel for his defence”. United States v Gonzalez-Lopez No 05-352 [26 June 2006]. 
     
      
       
      (d)  
      Protection of the integrity of the judicial process 
       
      
    28 There is ample authority to support the proposition that the Court has an inherent jurisdiction to protect the integrity of the judicial process. The principle has often been called in aid in circumstances where a solicitor has acted for two parties on a previous occasion, and is then called upon to act for one of those parties against the other. More often than not, it will arise because of the fact that the solicitor possesses confidential information which may be used adversely to the interests of the former client. Other instances have turned, not so much on the protection of confidential information, but on the Court’s concern to ensure that justice and appearance of justice be done (Black v Taylor (1993) 3 NZLR 403). In Kallinicos & Anor v Hunt & Ors [2005] 64 NSWLR 561, the Court ordered that a solicitor cease to act for the defendants in a civil suit. This was because the solicitor was likely to be a material witness on a controversial issue of substance; and his evidence and the propriety of his conduct would come under scrutiny, such that he would be in a position in which his interests, the interests of his former client and his obligations to the Court might well be in conflict.  
     
      
    29 In that case, Brereton J made a thorough review of the authorities on the point. After examining differences between authorities in New South Wales, Victoria and the United Kingdom, his Honour summarised the current position in New South Wales at para 76 (citations omitted). 
     
      
    · However, the Court always had inherent jurisdiction to restrain solicitors from acting in a particular case, as an incident of its inherent jurisdiction over its officers and to control its processes in aid of the administration of justice. 
     
      
    · The testimony to be applied in this inherent jurisdiction is whether a fair minded, reasonably informed member of the public would conclude that the proper administration of justice requires that a legal practitioner should be prevented from acting, in the interests of the protection of the integrity of the judicial process and the due administration of justice, including the appearance of justice. 
     
      
    · The jurisdiction is to be regarded as exceptional and is to be exercised with caution. 
     
      
    · Due weight should be given to the public interest in a litigant not being deprived of the lawyer of his or her choice without due cause. 
     
      
    · The timing of the application may be relevant, in that the cost, inconvenience or impracticality of requiring lawyers to cease to act may provide a reason for refusing to grant relief. 
     
      
    30 See also Spincode v Look Software Pty Limited [2001] 4 VR 501 at [58]. The categories may overlap because in some cases the possession of confidential information may give the lawyer an unfair or improper advantage such that it would compromise the integrity of the judicial process for him to continue to act. 
     
      
    31 A case which may be more useful in the context of the present motion is Grimwade. The first defendant had been retained as senior counsel to prosecute the plaintiff in relation to certain alleged criminal offences involving commercial dishonesty. The prosecutor appeared in the committal proceedings, during an aborted first trial and in a second trial of exceptional and unusual length. The plaintiff was convicted at the conclusion of this trial but successfully appealed to the Court of Criminal Appeal where it was decided that a third trial should not be ordered. In handing down its judgment, the Court of Criminal Appeal was critical of the conduct of the prosecutor at the second trial. The first defendant was retained as senior counsel for the plaintiffs in civil proceedings involving related issues. Sir Andrew Grimwade sought an order restraining the first defendant from appearing for those other persons in the civil proceedings. 
     
      
    32 After collecting and discussing the principles in a number of earlier authorities, Mandie J said at 452: - 
     
      
       
        
        “I would respectfully adopt all of the above quoted statements of principle. In my view it cannot be doubted that this Court likewise has an inherent jurisdiction to ensure the due administration of justice and to protect the integrity of the judicial process and as part of that jurisdiction, in an appropriate case, to prevent a member of counsel appearing for a particular party in order that justice should not only be done but manifestly and undoubtedly be seen to be done. The objective test to be applied in the context of this case is whether a fair minded reasonably informed member of the public would conclude that the proper administration of justice required that counsel be so prevented from acting, at all times giving due weight to the public interest that a litigant should not be deprived of his or her choice of counsel without good cause.” 
        
       
      
    33 Mandie J came to the conclusion that a fair-minded and informed observer would apprehend a real risk that the former prosecutor would, albeit unintentionally, lack the objectivity required of counsel in order to perform his duty to his client and to the Court. His Honour held that, “in the unique, extraordinary and highly exceptional circumstances”, the former prosecutor should be restrained from appearing. 
     
      
    34 It is agreed between the parties that the Grimwade test should be applied to the circumstances of this matter. 
     
      
       
      Factual evaluation: the events of 2 and 3 May 2006 
       
      
    35 The parties, especially the Commonwealth, have placed before me extensive submissions in relation to the factual situation concerning the events of 2 and 3 May 2006. I do not propose to descend into the minute details involved in an examination of those written submissions. Rather, I think that it will be sufficient if I examine the factual situation in a relatively broad manner, bearing in mind, however, the detailed submissions that have been made.  
     
      
    36 Indeed, the factual situation is, in many respects, a comparatively simple one. There is a complexity of evidence, however, which is explicable on the basis that those involved in the circumstances of the two days in May have had to do their best to recollect and reconstruct those circumstances, sometimes at a distance from the events themselves.  
     
      
    37 A convenient starting point is the Notice of Motion filed on behalf of the accused. This was dealt with by way of directions in the preparation for the hearing of pre-trial issues arising in the trial. Kirby J had been designated as the trial judge and the motion came before him for directions during March and April 2006. Relevantly, the motion sought an order in the following terms: - 
     
      
       
        
        “5. An order that the book entitled “Provision in the Rules of Jihad – Short Wise Rules and Organisational Structures that Concern every Fighter and Mujahid Fighting against the Infidels” as well as any statements made by the accused during the execution of a search warrant at his premises on 6 May 2004 be excluded in exercise of the Court’s discretion to exclude evidence improperly obtained, or alternatively upon the ground that the probative value of the evidence is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the accused.” 
        
       
      
    38 The motion was first returnable on 31 March 2006. There were four mentions dealing with preliminary directions in relation to the motion (and other matters) on 10 March, 31 March, 12 April and 19 April 2006. It is immediately apparent from an examination of the transcript of those mentions that the evidence to be adduced by the Crown at trial was likely to be within a very short compass. The Crown proposed to prove that the accused had published the book the subject of the charge. That involved proving his connection with Internet transmissions by which the text of the book was placed on a publicly accessible site. Apart from proving that matter, and some oral statements, which he made in the course of the execution of the search warrant at his home, the thrust of the Crown case would be to ask the jury simply to look at the book itself and its contents. The Crown case was that an examination of the book would plainly satisfy the jury that it was connected with preparation for a terrorist act. It can be seen immediately that, were the book and the oral statements to be excluded in pre-trial decision, the Crown case would simply fall to the ground. 
     
      
    39 Initially, the hearing of the motion was listed to take place on 24 April 2006, although the date was later changed. It was ultimately listed for hearing on 11 May 2006. Kirby J gave directions that the accused’s submissions in support of the motion should be filed by 4pm on 5 May 2006. The Crown was to respond by 10 May 2006. These orders were made on 19 April 2006. 
     
      
    40 The subpoena that is central to the present motion was issued on 20 April 2006. It was addressed to “Magistrate P. Morgan LCM, Downing Centre Local Court, 143-147 Liverpool Street, Sydney”. It was issued at the request of the accused’s lawyers and it required the production of documents to the Sydney Registry of the Supreme Court of New South Wales. The return date of the subpoena was Friday, 28 April 2006 at 9.30am. The documents required to be produced were: - 
     
      
       
        
        “1. All original and copy, record, materials and all other documents prepared in support of and relied on in issuing search warrant 616/2004 at the Downing Centre Local Court by Registrar P. Morgan LCM on 5 May 2004”. 
        
       
      
    41 It is necessary to return to the mention on 19 April 2006. On that day, Mr Ian Barker QC had appeared before Kirby J. Mr Fagan SC had appeared for the Crown. There were a number of important issues dealt with at the directions hearing. There is no need for me to detail all of these. One matter arose, however, in the context of the subpoena which was to be issued, as it happened, on the next day. It is clear from a reading of the transcript that Kirby J was anxious to ensure that written submissions in support of the motion be finalised without delay. Mr Barker QC discussed this aspect of the matter with Kirby J. In the course of that discussion, he made it plain what the nature of the legal argument on the exclusion issue would be. Senior counsel said: - 
     
      
       
        
        “The argument is, as I understand it, that the compulsory interrogation of Mr Khazaal by ASIO led to a disclosure of evidence now used against him which is contrary to the Act.” 
        
       
      
    42 The matter then under discussion was somewhat complicated by the fact that there had been an earlier subpoena issued by the defence. This was a subpoena issued to ASIO. It had been issued on 3 April and returnable on 12 April 2006. A complex of documents was sought in this subpoena. These documents related to intelligence obtained in relation to the suspected terrorist activities of the accused. In particular, it sought “any authorities or approvals given by the Director-General of ASIO to persons other than officers of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation to enable those other persons to exercise authorities or powers under the ASIO Act 1979”. It is clear that there was a potential for confusion in relation to the subpoena issued on the earlier date and the subpoena which was to be issued to the Local Court on 20 April. There were extensive and complicated national security issues in relation to the earlier subpoena. For that reason, ASIO had sought to come to an agreement with the accused’s legal team as to the width and extent of the subpoena, and in relation to the protection of sensitive material that might be involved in the production of documents under that earlier subpoena. 
     
      
    43 By contrast, as will have been noted, the critical subpoena, the one issued to the Local Court, was not, on its face, a complicated document. It simply required the production of documents “prepared in support of and relied on in issuing” the search warrant.  
     
      
    44 A young solicitor, Justin Le Blond, had caused the subpoena to be issued to the Local Court. He was employed by Mr Houda. Although Mr Houda had overall conduct of the litigation, it appears that he left it to Mr Le Blond to speak to his junior barrister, Peter Lange, about the detail of the process of obtaining the information necessary to support the contemplated written submissions. It was Mr Lange, for example, who apparently gave instructions to Mr Le Blond to issue the subpoena. 
     
      
    45 From Mr Le Blond’s perspective, the first problem that arose was this: the subpoena had been made returnable for Friday 28 April 2006. Mr Le Blond became aware however, that the Supreme Court Subpoena List operated only between Monday to Thursday. It did not function on a Friday. I should add that it seems that Mr Le Blond was on something of a learning curve, as he had been admitted as a solicitor only a brief time before, on 7 October 2005. In any event, he wrote to the Supreme Court Registry on 28 April requesting that the return of subpoena be listed for Tuesday 2 May 2006. Mr Le Blond said that he did not notify the Department of Public Prosecutions, the Australian Federal Police or any other Commonwealth Agency as to the issue of the subpoena. He did not understand it to be normal practice in criminal proceedings to do so. His experience, limited though it may have been, was that, whenever the DPP has an interest, it would appear on a return of subpoena, presumably because it has been informed by the recipient of the subpoena that it had been required to produce documents that might be the subject of an immunity claim. During his evidence, Mr Le Blond gave evidence of this situation arising in other matters, although he conceded he had not previously issued a subpoena to a Court. 
     
      
    46 As I have said, the Local Court arranged for the production of documents in answer to the subpoena. These documents, it seems, arrived at the Supreme Court Registry on 1 May 2006. The subpoena was listed before Registrar Durkin on 2 May 2006 at 9am. Mr Le Blond said he attended the Court on that morning. His purpose was to call on the subpoena and seek access to any documents produced. There was no appearance by the DPP at this return of subpoena. The Registrar informed Mr Le Blond that no documents had been produced. This was clearly an error. 
     
      
    47 Both Mr Houda and Mr Le Blond gave evidence that their experience had been, in the absence of opposition from any other person, that access would have been made available by the Registrar in the Court at the return of the of the subpoena. It did not happen on this occasion because of a mistaken belief on the Registrar’s part that no documents had in fact been produced. 
     
      
    48 An officer from the Registry rang Mr Houda shortly after Mr Le Blond had left the Court on 2 May 2006. This person said to Mr Houda: - 
     
      
       
        
        “Documents have been produced in answer to the Local Court subpoena but the Registrar at the return of the subpoena hearing did not know this as the documents were not delivered to the Court from the Registry”. 
        
       
      
    49 An officer of the Supreme Court who worked in the Registry gave evidence. This was Mr Richard Stride. He gave evidence on a number of topics. One of those related to the situation where an error of the kind that obviously happened here had occurred on other occasions. In such a situation, Mr Stride indicated that it was a possibility that he would ring the solicitor and let him know that the documents had in fact been produced. He did not, however, recall ringing Mr Houda. 
     
      
    50 Mr Houda rang Mr Le Blond on his mobile phone. The latter was still in the precincts of the Court at the time. Mr Houda asked him to go back to the Court and ask for access to the documents. He told Mr Le Blond that he had had a call from the Registry and that the caller had indicated that the documents had in fact been produced. 
     
      
    51 Mr Le Blond hurried back to Court 7E. But by the time he arrived there, the Court was closed, as its work for the morning had concluded. He spoke to a court officer and was told to go to the office of the Duty Registrar. Mr Le Blond told the Duty Registrar that he needed to get access to the documents which had in fact been produced. The Duty Registrar told him that she could not grant access because access must be granted in “open court”. According to Mr Le Blond’s affidavit, the Duty Registrar said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “You will have to get the written consent of the DPP before I can grant you access. If you get a letter from the DPP stating that they consent then I will grant you access”. 
        
       
      
    52 This was understood to be a reference to access being given in the Registry, rather than in open court. 
     
      
    53 Mr Le Blond said he informed both Peter Lange and Adam Houda of these events. Here, two points need to be made. First, Mr Le Blond appeared to be uncertain as to whether the Duty Registrar had said to him, as he deposed in his affidavit, “You will have to get written consent of the DPP before I can grant access” or whether she may have said “I can grant access if I have a letter or some form of written document from the other side or the other party”. In the ultimate, Mr Le Blond thought it “highly probable” that rather than using the term “the DPP”, when he told Mr Lange of the discussion with the Duty Registrar, he had said that he needed the consent of “the other side or the other party”. Secondly, Mr Houda said he had no recollection of being told by Mr Le Blond of the precise conversation that had taken place with the Duty Registrar. He conceded that it was possible that Mr Le Blond may have told him something about it. But he thought it rather more likely that the information had come to him from Mr Lange on the following day. 
     
      
    54 Mr Le Blond was now faced with something of a dilemma. He was in a difficult position. Through no fault of his own, he had not obtained access to the documents in open court that morning. He had complied with his employer’s direction and attempted to obtain access through the Duty Registrar. This too had been unsuccessful. He may have spoken to his counsel about the problem. Mr Lange said that his recollection was that Mr Le Blond had stated that he had been told by the Duty Registrar that he could not make an access order without the consent of the other party. Mr Lange thought it was he who had advised Mr Le Blond to contact Mr Abdul-Karim of the DPP’s office and explain that the defence team wanted the Director’s consent as a matter of urgency. Mr Le Blond’s evidence was that this may have been his own decision, 
     
      
    55 It may be convenient if I interrupt the narrative flow to record that, by the next day, Mr Lange said he became uncertain as to what the Duty Registrar may have meant by the expression “the other party”. As a result of that uncertainty, he advised Mr Le Blond to contact the Registrar of the Downing Centre Local Court with a view to obtaining information that the Local Court had no objection to access being given to the documents. This enquiry was, in fact, made but the result was unsatisfactory. Mr Le Blond was told “The document is now with the Supreme Court. What they do with it is up to them”. According to Mr Lange, Mr Le Blond also reported to him that, on the day previous he had, in fact, spoken to Mr Abdul-Karim. According to Mr Le Blond, the latter stated that the Australian Federal Police may object to inspection, although he had no instructions in the matter. 
     
      
    56 I now return to the detail of the events of Tuesday 2 May and to Mr Le Blond’s part in those events. As I have said, Mr Le Blond rang Mr Abdul-Karim. There are a number of differences between these two gentlemen about the content of the conversations between them. The essential differences are these: first, Mr Le Blond thinks that when he rang Mr Abdul-Karim at 4.45pm on the Tuesday, the response was that the DPP’s solicitor said that he would get back to Mr Le Blond about consent no later than the next afternoon. He asked for a copy of the subpoena to be faxed to him and said that he would get instructions. In fact, about 5.30pm on Tuesday afternoon, Mr Le Blond sent a copy of the subpoena, with a covering letter, to Mr Abdul-Karim. He informed Mr Lange that he had done so. 
     
      
    57 Despite the fact that Mr Le Blond’s letter enclosing the copy subpoena referred to the “urgency” of the situation, Mr Abdul-Karim maintained he had gained the impression that there was no particular urgency. He denied that he promised to get instructions by the following afternoon. He maintained that he had made it clear to Mr Le Blond that he did not consent to access but that he would pass the matter on for the instructions of the relevant agencies. 
     
      
    58 There is a further difference of opinion about the conversations the two men had on the next day. About 1.30pm on the Wednesday, Mr Le Blond says he rang Mr Abdul-Karim who, shortly thereafter, returned his call. Mr Abdul-Karim was asked whether he was able to give consent to access. According to Mr Le Blond, he replied: - 
     
      
       
        
        “I’m still not in a position to give you consent and I am still waiting on instructions 
        
       
      
    59 Mr Le Blond insists that Mr Abdul-Karim did not tell him that the DPP opposed access. On the other hand, Mr Abdul-Karim, during his evidence, maintained that he had made a categorical statement to Mr Le Blond that the DPP’s office did not consent to the defence being granted access to the documents.  
     
      
    60 As might be expected, it is not easy to reconcile these differences between the two lawyers. I am satisfied they were each doing their best to recall the conversations that occurred. Each had the benefit of some written material to support his recollections. My overall view is this: Mr Le Blond was a young, rather inexperienced solicitor who was doing his best to comply with instructions from a relatively demanding employer and a barrister who was becoming frustrated by the delays in obtaining access to material which was needed to finalise written submissions urgently. I consider it likely that Mr Le Blond impressed on Mr Abdul-Karim that the matter was urgent and I do not accept that any lesser impression would have been conveyed. Secondly, whatever precise words were used in the various conversations, I accept that Mr Le Blond came away from those conversations believing that it was simply a matter of waiting for consent to be given by Mr Abdul-Karim. I do not accept that Mr Abdul-Karim conveyed effectively the notion that the DPP were, in any event, opposed to the granting of access. Thirdly, I think it is more likely than not that Mr Le Blond conveyed the impression to Mr Lange, and possibly to Mr Houda if he spoke to him on the topic, that, so far as the DPP was concerned, the question of access was still an open one, and that consent might well be forthcoming by the afternoon of Wednesday, 3 May 2006. 
     
      
    61 One thing, I think, is clear. I do not believe that Mr Le Blond communicated the detail of the conversation with Mr Abdul-Karim on the Wednesday afternoon to Mr Houda. Whether he conveyed it to Mr Lange is not as clear, but, on balance, I regard it as unlikely he did. Mr Lange was very preoccupied on Wednesday afternoon, 3 May with the Lodhi trial in which he was then appearing as junior counsel. Mr Le Blond made no mention of any such conversation with Mr Lange in his carefully prepared affidavit of 7 September 2006 (Exhibit 4). 
     
      
    62 Mr Lange, by lunchtime on 3 May, was clearly becoming concerned that he would not be able to meet the deadline in relation to the preparation of written submissions. During the luncheon adjournment of the Lodhi trial, he went to the Registry of the Supreme Court to speak to the Duty Registrar about the problems which had arisen. The Registrar, however, did not become available before Mr Lange had to return to Court. For this reason, Mr Lange was unable to clarify the matter as he had hoped he might do. On his way back to the Court he ran into Robert Wood of the Australian Government Solicitor’s office. The two men were well known to one another and had a good working relationship. Mr Lange asked Mr Wood whether he was acting for the AFP in the Khazaal matter (he already knew that Mr Wood was acting for ASIO). Mr Wood said that he acted only on behalf of ASIO. But he offered to pass on a message to the AFP, if Mr Lange wished him to do so. Mr Lange said: - 
     
      
       
        
        “Fine. Can you please tell the AFP that, as they know, I have subpoenaed a document, and need access right away because submissions are due on Friday. I cannot wait any longer, and need to know what they propose to do”. 
        
       
      
    63 Mr Wood promised that he would pass on the message to the AFP after Court. In fact, about 4.45pm on that afternoon, Mr Wood, true to his word, rang Sheree Harrison, a solicitor working with the Federal Police. He told her of the discussion he had with Mr Lange and the request that had been made. As it turned out, Sheree Harrison had earlier that day seen a copy of the e-mail Mr Abdul-Karim had sent to Federal Agent Dale Redfern the previous evening. This had been sent presumably as a consequence of the conversation and correspondence Mr Abdul-Karim had with Mr Le Blond on 2 May 2006. Mr Redfern was the AFP case officer who had responsibility for the proceedings involving the accused. Ms Harrison had spent some time earlier on the Wednesday endeavouring to find out the situation from the Downing Centre Local Court. In fact, she had sent a letter by facsimile to Registrar Morgan at 1.30pm on that day. These calls, and the fax letter, demonstrate that the probable situation was that neither Mr Redfern or Ms Harrison had understood from Mr Abdul-Karim that the documents had already been produced by the Local Court at the Supreme Court Registry. They had, of course, been there since 1 May 2006. It also seems that Mr Abdul-Karim had not made reference to the urgency of the situation, at least so far as the legal representatives of the accused were concerned. 
     
      
    64 In any event, when Ms Harrison spoke to Mr Wood late on Wednesday afternoon, she made it clear to Mr Wood that the AFP did object to access being allowed to the affidavit. She also told him that the AFP intended to make an application for public interest immunity over the affidavit or parts of it. Mr Wood promised to let Mr Lange know. Unfortunately, although Mr Wood rang Mr Lange’s chambers shortly thereafter, he was unable to contact him. Mr Lange was probably inspecting the affidavit at or shortly before the time the telephone call was made. 
     
      
    65 At approximately 4 o’clock that afternoon, Mr Lange had left the court building where he had been appearing in the Lodhi trial. This trial was in No 3 Court King Street. He conferred briefly with Mr Houda and decided to go to the Registry by himself to make one more attempt to speak to the Duty Registrar. The system there is that persons wishing to interview the Duty Registrar take a ticket but must wait their turn to be called. Mr Lange did this promptly. But it became clear to him that he would not be able to speak to the Registrar that day, given the number of other people waiting ahead of him. It was then that he decided the only way to break what seemed to him to be a deadlock was to have the case listed before Kirby J. Consequently, he telephoned the chambers of the Crown Prosecutor, Mr Des Fagan SC. It was his intention to let Mr Fagan know that he was going to ask the Judge to list the matter urgently for discussion about the situation. Unfortunately, he was once again frustrated. Mr Fagan was in conference and unable to speak to Mr Lange. A message was left with the barrister’s clerk for Mr Fagan to call Mr Lange back as a matter of urgency. 
     
      
    66 Mr Lange says that he then called the chambers of Kirby J and spoke to his Associate. I should immediately say that there is a good deal of difference between the recollection of Mr Lange as to what he said to the Associate and the evidence of Miss Garrett as to her recollection of the conversation. In his affidavit, Mr Lange recalls the conversation in the following terms: - 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        PL: 
         ‘Hello this is Peter Lange. You might remember that I am the defence junior in the case of Khazaal.’ 
        
       
       
        
        PG: 
         ‘Yes, of course. What can I do for you?’ 
        
       
       
        
        PL: 
         ‘We have issued a subpoena to the Downing Centre Local Court in this case. The documents were produced to the Court on Monday, but because of an administrative oversight, they were not entered on the register in Court. As a result, we were obviously not granted access on Tuesday. I have had my instructing solicitor speak to the Downing Centre, and they have said that the matter has nothing to do with them. It seems as if we would have had access to the documents on Tuesday, had they been entered on the register. My instructing solicitor has now been told by the Duty Registrar that we cannot have access without the other party being present. However, the DPP has not given consent, and I have not been able to talk to the Duty Registrar to see whether their consent is really necessary. So, I would like to get this matter listed before the judge. How soon would we be able to get this matter on again? I have already called Mr Fagan, who is in conference at the moment, and asked him to call me back.’ 
        
       
       
        
        PG:  
        ‘One moment, please.’ 
        
       
       
        
        After approximately half a minute or a minute, the Associate came back on the phone and the conversation continued to the following effect: 
        
       
       
        
        PG: 
         ‘Who are you with at the moment?’ 
        
       
       
        
        PL: 
         ‘I am with my instructing Solicitor, Adam Houda.’ 
        
       
       
        
        PG: 
         ‘No, I mean who are you with in the registry?’ 
        
       
       
        
        PL: 
         ‘I am not with anyone at the moment’. 
        
       
       
        
        PG: 
         ‘Find someone behind one of the counters and let me talk to the person. You can have access’.” 
        
       
      
    67 Miss Garrett’s affidavit Exhibit “J” has been very carefully drawn. It does not purport to set out the conversation verbatim. Rather, it is a commentary on the evidence of Mr Lange indicating agreement with certain matters, probability in relation to others, lack of recollection in some matters and absolute disagreement in relation to a number of matters. Miss Garrett prepared a diary note on Thursday, 4 May 2006. Now, it is true that by this time she had had some contact with both Sheree Harrison and Mr Vorrieter who is with the Australian Government Solicitor’s office. The diary note is a lengthy one and I will not set it out in full. The first portion, however, bears repetition: - 
     
      
       
        
        “At approximately 4.30pm on Wednesday 3 May, Mr Lange of counsel phoned me from the Exhibits Registry on level 5. He advised that he wished to gain access to documents from the Downing Centre which he was aware had been received in the Registry as a result of a subpoena issued on behalf of his client. He needed access to the documents in order to complete submissions which were due this coming Friday 5 May. His solicitor had missed the return of subpoenas in the Registrar’s court. I am unsure as to whether his instructing solicitor was with him when he spoke to me on the phone. I spoke to Kirby J who advised that it would be in order for Mr Lange to inspect the documents. 
        
       
       
        
        I then asked Mr Lange to ascertain the name of Exhibit’s clerk who was assisting him. He advised that it was “Tanya”. He passed the phone to Tanya and I advised her that it was in order for Mr Lange to inspect the documents. I then relayed this to Mr Lange.” 
        
       
      
    68 The diary note also records that very shortly after this conversation, the Associate spoke to Richard Stride in the Criminal Registry. She confirmed to Mr Stride that the Judge had given leave for Mr Lange to inspect the envelope. Shortly after this conversation, Miss Garrett received a telephone call from Sheree Harrison who expressed strong disagreement with the fact that the envelope was being inspected. After a discussion with Kirby J, the matter was listed at 9am the next morning for argument re access to the material. Miss Garrett went down to the Criminal Registry and saw Mr Stride there. It was apparent that the inspection had already taken place. Mr Lange had left and the documents had been returned in the envelope to Mr Stride. Ultimately, the matter was listed for mention at 9.30am on the Friday morning, 5 May 2006, instead of the Thursday morning as first had been contemplated. 
     
      
    69 It is clear, as Miss Garrett mentioned in Exhibit “J”, that there was an undoubted error in her recollection of the discussion with Mr Lange as evidenced by the diary note. Miss Garrett readily conceded that she had not been told that Mr Lange’s solicitor “had missed the return of subpoenas in the Registrar’s court”. Rather, she was inclined to agree with Mr Lange’s affidavit that he may have said that the documents had been produced to the Court on Monday, but because of an administrative oversight, they were not entered on the register in the court. Miss Garrett said that she had a very clear recollection that, at no time in the conversation, did Mr Lange refer to the DPP or mention the issue of consent. She said it was also clear in her mind that Mr Lange had not asked for the matter to be listed before the Judge. She thought that Mr Lange wanted urgent access to the subpoenaed document and that she was being requested to ask the Judge about access. 
     
      
    70 It is very clear to me that both Mr Lange and Miss Garrett are honest witnesses each doing their best to recall, in somewhat difficult circumstances, the precise content of a hurried telephone call made in a somewhat urgent situation. It also seems clear to me that some degree of misunderstanding occurred between Mr Lange and Miss Garrett. While the misunderstanding was plainly mutual, I have no doubt that the major responsibility fell on Mr Lange. It was his obligation to make it clear to the Associate what it was he was asking and why. I am satisfied that he failed to achieve this with necessary clarity. But, at the same time, I am satisfied that Mr Lange was not attempting to deceive or mislead either the Associate or the Judge. No criticism can be made of Miss Garrett who was clearly doing her best to assist Mr Lange. 
     
      
    71 I am also satisfied that at the conclusion of the conversation, Mr Lange understood that it would be no longer necessary for him to have the matter listed, as he had first set out to achieve. Rather, he understood that had been given immediate access to the material. On the other hand, Miss Garrett had formed the view, mistakenly I think, that Mr Lange was asking for access and that coloured the matters she reported to the Judge. I rather take it from the transcript of the mention on 5 May 2006 that there was a possible additional area of confusion, namely whether the conversation related to the subpoena to ASIO which had been the subject of prolonged discussion on previous mentions. This, however, is no more than an impression I have from listening to the evidence and looking at all the material before me. I have formed no concluded view about that aspect. 
     
      
    72 As it happened, Mr Houda met up with Mr Lange in the Registry at about the time the latter was concluding his conversation with the Judge’s Associate. It seems that Mr Houda may have been present when “Tanya”, told the two men that they could go to the 4th floor Registry where they could inspect the documents. It was in that location that Mr Stride produced the envelope. There is a difference of recollection between Mr Lange and Mr Houda at this point, although I do not think it is of any real moment. The envelope which was produced by Mr Stride was not remarkable in any way. It was not marked, for example, “confidential” or “top secret”. Mr Lange said, had the material been contained in a sealed envelope marked in that way (as he had experienced in other matters), he might have been alerted to the fact that he was about to examine material which could have national security sensitivity. In fact, Mr Lange said the envelope was of a type ordinarily seen when a document is subpoenaed. There was no indication that the document inside the envelope was to be treated confidentially or that it was the subject of any form of court order, undertaking of confidentiality or similar. The pages were marked “highly protected” but that particular marking was well known to both men in litigation of this kind and they did not consider it equated with “secret”. In addition, it seems the material in the envelope was a copy of the original Warrant Affidavit, although that was not known to or noticed by the respondents. 
     
      
    73 Mr Lange’s recollection is that when the material was first being read, Mr Stride came over and said: - 
     
      
       
        
        “I have had a telephone call from the AFP. They object to your inspecting the document.” 
        
       
      
    74 In response, Mr Houda sought to return the document to Mr Stride. Mr Stride then replied: - 
     
      
       
        
        “No. You have been granted access by the Judge. He has said you can have access.” 
        
       
      
    75 Mr Houda’s recollection was that this conversation occurred before the inspection had begun. As I have said, I do not think that anything turns materially upon this difference in recollection. Both men understood, from the remarks of Mr Stride, that the Judge had made an order permitting access to the documents produced in answer to the subpoena after being aware of the objection of the AFP. 
     
      
    76 During his evidence, Mr Lange acknowledged that some of the material he looked at was sensitive material. He qualified this by saying that its sensitivity was something which was apparent to him in retrospect. There was other material that was probably sensitive, although he was not aware of the reasons which might make it so. There were also matters that he said were public knowledge. He agreed that, with the benefit of hindsight, alarm bells should have gone off even though they did not at the time. At transcript 110 he said: - 
     
      
       
        
        “With the benefit of hindsight, I see it as a very unfortunate incident from which I think everyone has learnt. I am not going to say otherwise. But that does not affect my ultimate belief that I am capable of obeying my undertakings, which I have done in other cases, and which have been accepted.” 
        
       
      
    77 Returning to the inspection, Mr Lange said that, in scanning the document, he was looking for two particular terms. It was only this material that would be relevant to the submissions he was preparing. Moreover, he was in a hurry, as he had a conference scheduled in chambers with senior counsel at about the time he received the document in the Registry. He said that he spent no more than approximately two minutes scanning the document. Once he had found the passage that he was looking for, he pointed this out to Mr Houda. He then placed the document back in its envelope. It was then returned to Mr Stride. He made no note about what he had read. All he wanted to see was whether the AFP had relied upon material obtained in a certain way and that was sufficient for him to be able to make the submission he wished to make in support of the Notice of Motion to exclude evidence. He did not see anything else in the document that, in his view, was relevant to the charge that had been laid against Mr Khazaal. There was some material that could potentially be relevant to other charges but, those charges had not been brought against the accused. 
     
      
    78 Events moved quickly after the inspection had concluded. Mr Lange and Mr Houda went into conference with senior counsel on another matter. Mr Robert Wood rang through and spoke to Mr Lange. He explained the Commonwealth’s concern related to the inspection. He asked them to give undertakings and they agreed that they would. On the next day, 4 May 2006, Mr Wood delivered to each of Mr Lange and Mr Houda a letter from AGS dated 4 May 2006. He witnessed the documents they signed. The undertakings were, it will be recalled, contained in these signed letters. 
     
      
    79 The matter was mentioned before Kirby J on 5 May 2006. It was indicated to his Honour that orders would be sought, supplementing the undertakings which had been given, to ensure that there would be no inadvertent or other disclosure of any of the material that had been seen by Mr Lange during the inspection and which may have been seen by Mr Houda. I have already set out, earlier in this decision, the orders which his Honour made. These orders were made by consent and it is clear that there has been no suggestion of any breach of their terms. 
     
      
    80 On 26 May 2006, the Commonwealth indicated its intention to commence proceedings to seek injunctive relief restraining Mr Houda and Mr Lange from acting further in the proceedings. Consequently, the motion was filed on 1 June 2006 and directions were given for the conduct of the proceedings relating to the motion. 
     
      
    81 There is one final factual matter that needs to be mentioned and evaluated. Mr Houda has maintained that, during the inspection by Mr Lange, he did not read the material himself. He also maintained that he told Mr Lange this when they were discussing the issue of giving undertakings, as requested by the Commonwealth. Mr Lange confirms that a discussion in those terms probably took place. Mr Houda also maintains that he told Mr Robert Wood that he had not read the document. Mr Wood said he had no recollection of that having been said in conversation, although he conceded that he did not keep a file note at the time. 
     
      
    82 Mr Houda maintained during his cross-examination that he did not in fact read any of the material inspected by Mr Lange during the brief two-minute inspection. He may have looked at the page to which Mr Lange drew his attention. But he did not read it. I accept Mr Houda’s evidence in this regard. Mr Houda impressed me as a passionate, busy and efficient solicitor. He is, however, a solicitor who is more interested in the overall picture than the detail. He employs solicitors to attend to the detail and instructs counsel to advise him as to the strategy and procedures to be adopted. Mr Houda conceded that, with the exception of Mr Wood, he had not mentioned to anybody from the Commonwealth side of the case that he had not read the document until he made this claim in his sworn affidavit. It is also true that in the undertaking letter signed by Mr Houda, he made no claim that he had not seen the material in respect of which the undertakings were given. I do not see either of those matters as of any particular significance. As I have said, Mr Houda was quite firm in his continued assertion that he had not read the material and I accept him on that point. He maintained that he had told Mr Wood this shortly after the matter “blew up” and that he had told Mr Wood this in the presence of Mr Lange. I accept that this was so. 
     
      
       
      Preliminary issue – closed court hearing - Confidential judgment 
       
      
    83 During the hearing, two issues arose in closed court session. The court was closed for brief periods of time to enable confidential evidence to be considered and for the making of confidential submissions. The first issue related indirectly to that part of the Warrant Affidavit inspected by Mr Lange which dealt specifically with the factual matters he and Mr Barker QC needed to underpin the legal argument relating to the exclusion from evidence of the book said to the subject of the first charge in the indictment. There had been a Certificate issued by the Attorney-General on 26 July 2006. This Certificate related to the trial of the accused and had been issued under the provisions of the National Security (Criminal & Civil Proceedings) Act 2004 (“the NSI Act”). One effect of the issue of the Certificate was that the material mentioned in the Certificate could not, while the Certificate was in force, be disclosed by the prosecutor and the accused. The Certificate allowed for certain exceptions. But these exceptions themselves were subject to security protection measures. They picked up, as I understand it, matters referred to in orders made by Justice Kirby on 12 April 2006. These orders not only dealt with disclosure but included protective orders to ensure that exempted documents were used only for the purpose of the proceedings. They also required that the court should be closed during any part of the proceedings concerning those documents. There is no need for me to detail the wide range of other protective measures that were reflected in the orders. 
     
      
    84 After the filing of the present motion on behalf of the Commonwealth, Mr Barker QC, who still held the senior brief for the accused, sought access on behalf of his client to material in the Warrant Affidavit. As might be expected, this was a contentious issue and was originally listed as a contested hearing before Bell J in August 2006. Mr Barker QC and Mr Willee QC, however, reached agreement as to a methodology to avoid the necessity for a contested hearing. The agreement is reflected in a confidential letter exchanged between senior counsel on or about 3 August 2006. The nature of the agreement was the disclosure of certain matters to Mr Barker QC which had the effect of meeting the forensic purpose for which the Local Court subpoena had been issued. At the same rime, it obviated the need for Mr Barker to continue his application for access to the Warrant Affidavit. The Commonwealth took the view that the disclosure which it made to Mr Barker QC should remain secret. That position was, for the time being at least, agreed between the Crown and the defence. It will be recalled that Mr Lange had access to this aspect of the Warrant Affidavit but that he had given undertakings not to disclose the material he had seen. 
     
      
    85 The machinery adopted before Bell J to record the agreement reached between the trial parties was to include new material in “the specified documents” referred to in Order 1 made by Kirby J on 12 April 2006. The letter from the Australian Government Solicitor to Mr Ian Barker QC dated 3 August 2006 was one of the matter so included. As well, there was correspondence proceeding the letter which related to the disclosure of the information set forth in it. The result was that the letter of 3 August 2006 was “disclosed” to the legal representatives, but its use was limited to the trial and was subject to the raft of protection orders applicable to all specified documents referred to in the orders made by Kirby J on 12 April 2006. Both the orders made by Kirby J and Bell J reflected agreements between the prosecutor and the accused, sanctioned no doubt by the Commonwealth, pursuant to s 22 of the NSI Act. Agreements of that kind, as I understand the legislation, avoid the need for the Court to undertake the more cumbersome proceedings necessary where agreement has not been reached in relation to the disclosure and protection of national security information. 
     
      
    86 In the event, it became necessary for me to respond to an argument advanced on behalf of Mr Houda by Mr Gageler SC. The argument was conducted in closed court because it related to Mr Gageler’s suggestion that the material matters in the letter to Mr Barker QC dated 3 August 2006, were in fact matters in the public domain. Mr Gageler argued that these were the only matters that Mr Houda gleaned from the inspection process conducted by Mr Lange. Although Mr Houda was content to abide by the undertakings he had given, and indeed offered similar undertakings to this Court, Mr Gageler argued that any analysis of suggested impropriety on his part ought take into account the fact that this aspect of the inspected material was, in truth, in the public domain. The court was closed to enable this argument to be fleshed out. It became apparent to me that the argument should be addressed in a confidential and separate decision. 
     
      
    87 The second issue was a more limited one. Mr Boulten SC tendered a chapter of a book which had been published at an earlier period of time but which now had been withdrawn from publication. A chapter and footnotes from this book were tendered. There was vigorous debate in closed court as to whether it should be admitted. Ultimately, Mr Boulten accepted that the tender itself should be confidential, having in mind the protection of the accused’s interests in the forthcoming trial. Again, I agreed to make a ruling on the tender in a confidential judgment. The decision I reached is that the tender material lacks relevance. Consequently, I reject the tender. The reasons are contained in the confidential judgment. 
     
      
       
      Resolution of the issues 
       
      
    88 The principles which I have set out much earlier in this decision must now be applied to the facts as I have found them. What is to be the outcome? The starting point is the fundamental proposition that Belal Khazaal, the accused in this matter, is entitled to counsel of his choice. This is an important right. It is, of course, not an absolute right but it is plainly a serious matter to prevent a party from retaining counsel and solicitor of his choice, particularly where the possibility arises upon the application of an opposite or adverse party. The Commonwealth is not, strictly speaking, a party to the trial process. But as a consequence of the National Security Information (Criminal & Civil Proceedings) Act 2004, it has the potential, indeed a realistic potential, to be treated as if it were a party to the criminal proceedings (s 30(2) of the NSI Act). 
     
      
    89 In relation to this fundamental and important right, I should say that it is not merely a matter of testing whether there might be other counsel available or other solicitors available. It is not merely a matter of testing whether, for example, there might be counsel and solicitors who are as well or better experienced to handle the trial for the accused. Nor is it simply a matter of determining the point at which the litigation may stand, or of determining other matters of mere convenience. Each of those matters may be relevant, but they are by no means determinative. 
     
      
    90 The principles of law applicable to this motion establish quite clearly that, the right of choice of counsel and solicitor is so fundamental, especially in criminal proceedings, that it should not be disturbed except in the most unusual and exceptional circumstances and where no other remedy is otherwise available. The test, it will be recalled, is whether a fair minded reasonably informed member of the public would conclude that the proper administration of justice requires that the respondents be prevented from appearing in the trial. 
     
      
    91 Before examining this broad test, it is appropriate, however, to consider the fact that there are inter-party undertakings in force; and that there are orders of the Court in force, As well, it is proposed that appropriate undertakings be given to this Court. The purpose of all those procedures, enshrined as they are in historical well-understood precedent, is to give protection to the sensitive national security information which, in the case of Mr Lange has been observed by him; and in the case of Mr Houda has been in part communicated to him. 
     
      
    92 What is the force of undertakings and orders of this kind? In my view, it is clear that the high value placed by the Courts on compliance with orders and undertakings of this kind leads, unless there are exceptional circumstances, to a situation where the Court can and must be confident that the utmost protection will be afforded to the confidential material involved. Save in those exceptional circumstances I have mentioned, the Court is able to place the utmost reliance on an undertaking given by a solicitor or barrister. A failure to honour an undertaking is a serious breach of professional conduct which has the capacity to result in significant disciplinary action.  
     
      
    93 It is my view that, subject to the resolution of the Commonwealth’s second major argument, the issue of an injunction to prevent the respondents from acting in the accused’s trial, in light of the orders and undertakings both in existence and proffered, would be completely lacking in utility and, for that reason, unnecessary. (T. R. Flanagan Smash Repairs Pty Limited v Jones (1999) FCA 1391 at (16-18) per Hely J). Moreover, the existence of those orders and undertakings obviate the need to make the orders sought in para 2 of the Notice of Motion. I shall state my reasons. 
     
      
    94 First, in my earlier decision of 25 October 2006, I said (para 37) that some of the material in the Warrant Affidavit was material that simply should not be disclosed at all, if it were at all possible to avoid that situation. The qualification inherent in this statement may arise in any number of ways. For example, a particular piece of sensitive national security information may require disclosure to enable the accused to have a fair trial and where, were it were otherwise, the administration of justice would, or might be, imperilled. That is not the case here, at least for the purpose of the present application. Another situation which may arise is where inadvertent disclosure has occurred. As I understand it, that type of situation has previously arisen in terrorist trials in New South Wales. Where it has occurred, it has been met by orders and undertakings. A third situation is that which has developed here. In this matter, Mr Lange read the warrant information and communicated part of it to his instructing solicitor, Mr Houda. In such a situation, provided the Court can legitimately expect adherence to its orders and to undertakings, there is every reason to suppose that the information will be protected from further disclosure. 
     
      
    95 Secondly, while there is a need to guard against inadvertent disclosure, this risk can, in the rather unusual circumstances of this matter, be satisfactorily reduced, if not eliminated, by the giving of undertakings. As I said in my earlier judgment, absolute non-disclosure is an ideal that cannot always be achieved (para 38). Both the Australian Federal Police and ASIO have, in the present matter, disclosed information for the purpose of obtaining a search warrant. The disclosure, of course, was limited to the Magistrate issuing the search warrant. This very process however, raises the potential for inadvertent disclosure beyond the issuing Magistrate. In addition, there has been the limited disclosure represented by the agreement reached between the Commonwealth and Mr Barker QC, a confidential matter in itself. This is referred to in Mr O’Sullivan’s confidential affidavit. It is not appropriate at this stage to say anything about this agreement that reveals more publicly its nature. But the process of disclosure may go even further as the pre-trial procedures and the trial progresses. The National Security Information Act recognises that this is so or, at least, that it may be so. In all this area of incremental disclosure, the potential for inadvertent disclosure is, once again, widened. 
     
      
    96 Thirdly, it is necessary to recognise another consequence of the manner in which Mr Lange read the Warrant Affidavit material. Of course, it seems highly likely that, although he is well seized of the principal matter that he was seeking to discover when he examined the affidavit, it is also the likely situation that he has very little recall of the other material in the affidavit. The greater degree of sensitivity in relation to national security information, in my view, attaches to the material which Mr Lange did not examine in detail and which he plainly does not remember except in one specific area (see para 26 of Mr Lange’s affidavit - Exhibit 1). Even in this area of partial recall, it is clear that Mr Lange did not absorb, and does not remember much, if any, of the details. He skimmed the document, it will be recalled, in about two minutes and was looking for a particular subject matter. (By contrast, I might add, it took me nearly forty minutes to read and absorb the contents of Exhibit “E” on the access argument, now Exhibit “M” in the present motion. Once Mr Lange located that subject matter, he ceased the inspection. He took no notes. So far as Mr Houda is concerned, I have accepted that he did not read the material at all. As a consequence, he has no idea of the nature of the sensitive material contained in the affidavit with the exception of the one matter that was communicated to him by Mr Lange. 
     
      
    97 Fourthly, I am unable to see how the removal of either of the respondents from the accused’s trial would further the situation beyond the protection likely to be gained from the orders and undertakings to which I have made reference. Let it be assumed, contrary to the findings I have made, that either of the two gentlemen has in his mind a significant degree of sensitive national security information gleaned from the brief inspection. If there be a danger of disclosure, inadvertent or otherwise, it would exist whether or not they were acting for the accused in his trial. It is necessary for me to emphasise that the Commonwealth has acknowledged that there is nothing in the Warrant Affidavit which, if it were known to and recalled by the respondents, would create a situation of conflict between their duty to adhere to undertakings, on the one hand, and their duty to their client on the other. I have myself carefully assessed the confidential material in the Warrant Affidavit. I agree that there is nothing there that assists the defence case in relation to the merits of the substantive criminal charges. 
     
      
    98 Fifthly, the evidence unequivocally shows that Mr Lange has a significant history of acting in a manner, which demonstrates his reliability to comply with obligations undertaken in connection with national security matters. He has been involved in a number of cases involving terrorism charges. In these cases, he has frequently been asked to provide and has provided confidentiality undertakings. He has fully complied with those undertakings in each instance. I am satisfied that he has displayed a firm professional attitude of integrity towards the protection of sensitive information. 
     
      
    99 There have been occasions where Mr Lange has been inadvertently provided with material, which unintentionally disclosed to him national security information. One such instance was in the matter of R v Ul-Haque. The Commonwealth took issue with Mr Lange over this matter and suggested that he may have displayed an attitude that was less than satisfactory in relation to the handing back of the inadvertent material he had received. I do not accept this assertion. Mr Lange had been provided with a brief of material comprising some 1200 pages. The Commonwealth later demanded that the material be handed back because, included in it, was a small amount of national security information. There was a debate between the parties about the form of the orders necessary to resolve the situation. For example, there was disagreement, on the part of the defence, that they should simply hand back the 1200 page brief. Mr Barker QC had a role in this debate. Senior counsel advised, correctly in my opinion, that the material could not simply be handed back “holus-bolus”. 
     
      
    100 It is clear that the brief had acquired a privileged status by the time the Commonwealth asked for it to be returned. There were, by then, notes and instructions written on it. It became necessary for the Federal Court to intervene but, in my view, Mr Lange behaved properly and responsibly at all times until the matter was sensibly resolved by the making of interim orders and the giving of voluntary undertakings. The effect of these was to compel the Commonwealth to identify the sensitive material contained in the brief and to isolate it so it could be returned in proper form. The undertakings by Mr Lange were given, as I have said, on a voluntary basis. They were undertakings not to disclose the material that has been inadvertently supplied. It is clear that the Commonwealth accepts that Mr Lange has at all times honoured this undertaking. 
     
      
    101 The final argument advanced under this heading by the Commonwealth suggested that the respondents do not have the level of appreciation of their obligations to the Court, the Commonwealth and the public in relation to national security information which would be necessary for the Court to repose continuing trust in them in relation to the sensitive information in the Warrant Affidavit. This is said to arise from the circumstances in which they examined the Warrant Affidavit, and the circumstances of their conduct in the defence of the present application. It will be seen that this submission overlaps with the second major argument presented by the Commonwealth, namely the need to protect the integrity of the judicial process. I shall turn to that issue now.  
     
      
       
       
       
      Need to protect the integrity of the judicial process 
       
       
      The position of Mr Lange 
       
      
    102 The Commonwealth has submitted that Mr Lange acted in a deliberate or reckless endeavour to gain improper access to sensitive and confidential material. I am not satisfied that the Commonwealth has sustained this allegation against Mr Lange and I reject it. The position as I see it is this: Mr Lange was in a difficult position. He was anxious, indeed extremely anxious, to comply with a timetable set by the Court to file written submissions. From his perspective, he needed to access the material produced on subpoena to satisfy himself that the factual basis of the legal argument foreshadowed by Mr Barker QC existed. It is clear that he consulted Mr Wood on the afternoon of the 3 May 2006. He did so in an endeavour to draw the AFP’s attention to the issue at hand. While he was in the Registry office later that afternoon, he endeavoured to speak to Mr Fagan SC and spoke to his clerk stressing the urgency of the matter. He did this before speaking to the Judge’s Associate. 
     
      
    103 It is, to my mind, very clear that if Mr Lange had been attempting to seek access to the material in an improper manner, he would not have made these approaches or attempted approaches. They were consistent with an attitude of mind that contemplated, at that stage, accessing the material after consent had been given. 
     
      
    104 Moreover, it is clear that a number of the problems that presented themselves on the afternoon of 3 May did not directly relate to Mr Lange at all. First, there is the ironic fact that authorised access may have occurred on Tuesday 2 May 2006, had Mr Le Blond been given access to the documents produced in Court. It was an error within the Court system that inadvertently prevented this happening. Moreover, the failure to notify the DPP or other agencies of the issue of the subpoena was not a matter that can, or ought to be, sheeted home to Mr Lange. In a perfect world, he might have reminded himself to caution Mr Le Blond to let other people know about the issue of the subpoena. But Mr Lange had no role in the actual issue of the subpoena, other than to direct his solicitor that it should be issued. 
     
      
    105 There were other extrinsic matters that played a part in the ultimate situation which developed. First, there was the not insignificant fact that the Warrant Affidavit was contained in a plain envelope. There is no explanation for this because, as Deputy Commissioner Lawler indicated, the material had originally been in a sealed envelope bearing the note “Official AFP Documents”. It is true that the Warrant Affidavit is marked “Highly Protected” on each page. In this regard, I accept Mr Lange’s evidence that, in his experience, many documents, if not the majority, received during the course of preparation for terrorist trials are marked in this way, even though they are not, by any means, necessarily dealing with national security information. Moreover, Mr Lange said that where there is sensitive material, in either redacted or un-redacted form, from ASIO, it is usually marked “Secret”. No such markings appear on the Warrant Affidavit, although it is conceded that this material issued directly from the AFP rather than from ASIO. I might add, although there was no argument about it that the confidential affidavit of Deputy Commission Lawler suggests (para 5) the possibility – I put it no higher – of an erroneous classification on the part of the AFP. There is also the fact that a copy of the Warrant Affidavit was produced by the Local Court. This may explain the presence of an “Unmarked” envelope. Further more, the Warrant Affidavit contained the following instructions in paras 9 and 10: - 
     
      
       
        
        “9. An affidavit filed in support of an application for a Search Warrant may include material which is operationally sensitive or is subject to a secrecy provision. It may also include details of police methodology or information which could be used to identify a confidential source of information. Accordingly, I ask that the affidavit be returned to me for safe keeping when the application has been dealt with or that, if it is not returned, that the affidavit be kept in a secure place and that appropriate arrangements are made to protect it from theft or unauthorised access. 
        
       
       
        
        10. If the affidavit is returned to me, I undertake to keep it in a secure place and to make it available to the issuing officer, on request, if he or she has a need to see it. If the affidavit is not returned to me, I ask that it not be released to any person, or made available to any person, without prior consultation with me and that I be notified before the affidavit is released if it is required to be produced under a court order or other compulsory process.” 
        
       
      
    106 It appears that these instructions were not noted at the Local Court and the request went unheeded. 
     
      
    107 Against the background of these matters, I conclude that, immediately prior to speaking to Kirby J’s Associate, Mr Lange had been making a number of attempts, in the end ultimately unsuccessfully, to contact the Commonwealth officers and senior counsel to place them on notice that he was endeavouring to resolve the access problem which had arisen. His immediate intention, when he spoke to the Judge’s Associate, was to try and list the matter the next day so that the problem could be resolved to enable him to comply with the timetable for filing written submissions. I also accept that Mr Lange was genuinely uncertain about whether the Duty Registrar required consent to be obtained from “the other party” and I reject the suggestion Mr Lange has, in any sense, fabricated or made up this matter. 
     
      
    108 Mr Lange’s general state of mind is well exposed by his instruction to Mr Le Blond to send a copy of the subpoena to Mr Abdul-Karim as a matter of urgency on 2 May 2006. If, as appears to be the case, the AFP were not aware of the subpoena prior to this point, they were well aware of it once a copy had been sent to the solicitor. Mr Abdul-Karim did not inform Mr Redfern that the documents had already been produced to the Registry. Nor did he indicate the degree of urgency involved in the situation. In saying this, I am not intending to be critical of Mr Abdul-Karim but merely noting that this was one of the many circumstances that contributed to the complex of facts and misunderstandings that, in part, resulted in the unfortunate inspection in the Registry. 
     
      
    109 So it was that Mr Lange found himself in the Registry office, once again, shortly after 4pm on 3 May 2006. Again, I accept that his purpose in being there related to his attempts to clarify the manner in which he could gain access to the documents. I accept that his actions in this regard, that is his endeavours to see the Registrar, related to the issue, which had been troubling him during that day. This was the question as to which party was required to give consent for access. Once again, Mr Lange was frustrated in this endeavour to clarify the situation because he was simply unable to speak to the Duty Registrar before the anticipated close of business. As soon as that became clear to him, he endeavoured to inform his opponent of his intention to have the matter listed. He then rang the Judge’s Associate to try and arrange the listing. 
     
      
    110 The difference in the respective recollections of Mr Lange and Miss Garrett simply reinforce in my mind, as I have earlier analysed, that there was a significant misunderstanding between the two during the telephone conversation. The informality of the approach, together with the urgency of the application, make the emergence of this misunderstanding perfectly explicable. The blame for the misunderstanding, if I may call it that, must however fall, in the main, on Mr Lange’s shoulders. It was his obligation as counsel to make it absolutely clear to Miss Garrett what it was that he was seeking to do. He did not succeed in that endeavour and the Associate went to the Judge genuinely thinking there was an uncontested application for access to documents in circumstances where the solicitor had missed the return of the subpoena. On the other hand, that last misconception on the part of the Associate does not appear to be attributable to anything Mr Lange actually said to her. But it is a good indication of the misunderstanding that arose between the two people during the brief telephone discussion. I accept that Mr Lange believed that access had been given to him in circumstances where the preliminary conversation occurred as he recollects it. At the very least, something quite close to that conversation occurred between he and the Associate. I also accept that, when the actual inspection was being made, the conversation with Mr Stride was understood by Mr Lange as reinforcing that he had been given permission to look at the contents of the envelope, even though there had been objection by the Australia Federal Police. 
     
      
    111 All these matters bring me to the comfortable conclusion that this was not a deliberate or reckless attempt to improperly gain access to sensitive material. It involved, essentially, a series of misunderstandings over the two-day period, and these, coupled with other factual matters I have identified, led Mr Lange to believe he was not doing the wrong thing when he made his brief inspection. 
     
      
    112 This conclusion does not mean that Mr Lange’s actions were beyond criticism. There are a number of criticisms that can and should be made about his behaviour on those days. But these criticisms must be seen in the context that here was a young, enthusiastic barrister attempting to do the right thing by his client, his instructing solicitor and his leader. Mr Lange was obviously pressed for time throughout this two-day period because of his other commitments. He was making decisions on the run and, perhaps, without adequate or appropriate time for reflection on the wisdom or appropriateness of his actions. 
     
      
    113 My criticisms of Mr Lange are these: first, I think he should have taken more care to ensure that Mr Le Blond turned his mind to the question as to whether notice should be given to other people concerning the issue of the subpoena. Secondly, he should have been less impatient and more circumspect when, as he saw it, there was delay in consent coming from the Australian Federal Police for the inspection process. Thirdly, when he made his telephone call to Miss Garrett and was told that he could have access, he should have immediately reflected upon this situation and adhered to his initial plan namely, to have the matter mentioned in the Court the next morning prior to inspection. He should have realised that there may have been a misunderstanding. This would have enabled him to speak to Mr Fagan and Mr Wood and ensure that all those who had an interest in the issue, if it were to be an issue, would be present at the mention and able to put their position. Mr Lange has conceded that, after he was told he had been given access, he was acting on an assumption which he now realises was a false assumption. I consider that mature reflection would have, or at least may have, brought this home to him. Fourthly, he should have been more careful in relation to the matter he asked Miss Garrett to convey to the Judge. I do not accept however, that he intended to mislead the Associate or Kirby J in this regard. Fifthly, Mr Lange should have appreciated more quickly than he did, when he inspected the document, that the material was much more national security sensitive than he had imagined it would be. It is fair to say that Mr Lange has now acknowledged that this was so, albeit with the benefit of hindsight. He said that “alarm bells should have rung” but regrettably they did not at the time. Mr stride’s remarks to him should have rung the same alarm bells. These matters of criticism, important though they be, do not, in my view, amount to professional impropriety warranting the grant of the Commonwealth’s application. I am confident that Mr Lange is now aware of the shortcomings of his own judgments and actions on 3 May 2006, and that he will benefit, in a professional sense, from the bitter lesson emerging from the rigours of the present application. 
     
      
    114 It is of course, easy to be wise after the event. I am sure that most responsible members of the Bar find it necessary to reflect regularly on their own professional shortcomings from time to time. Mistakes can happen. Errors of judgment can occur. In essence, that is I think what happened in the present matter. 
     
      
    115 I do not accept the submissions of Mr Willee QC which suggested that, in the conduct of this application, Mr Lange, or Mr Houda for that matter, has been guilty of any misconduct or lack of propriety so as to cast doubt upon the efficacy of the undertakings that have been given or proffered. 
     
      
       
      The position of Mr Houda 
       
      
    116 I turn now to consider the situation of Mr Houda. The criticisms against Mr Houda must, in the face of the findings of fact I have made, fall substantially below those made or charged against Mr Lange. First, there is no suggestion that there is anything in the material conveyed by Mr Lange to Mr Houda that raised a conflict between Mr Houda’s duty to his client and his obligations to the Court. Secondly, I have accepted that he did not read the contents of the envelope but simply watched Mr Lange skim the document for about two-minutes. He looked at the part of the affidavit material when Mr Lange commented that he had found what he was looking for. But he did not read it. I have also found that Mr Houda did tell Mr Wood that he had not read the Warrant Affidavit. This was a matter Mr Houda was much more likely to recall than Mr Wood, given the importance of the issue to Mr Houda personally. Mr Lange supported Mr Houda on this point. Moreover, the matter commented on by Mr Lange to Mr Houda related to the one fact, namely that he had found corroboration of the suggestion that the AFP had relied on certain ASIO information and that this had appeared from the inspection Mr Lange had made. The detail of the corroboration is the matter that will be the subject of the application to exclude evidence which has now lain fallow for many months. 
     
      
    117 In the case of Mr Houda, I consider that it may be comfortably concluded that there was no deliberate or reckless attempt on his part improperly to gain access to sensitive material. Indeed, his appearance with Mr Lange at the Registry was a complete matter of chance. There is no evidence that he knew that an objection had been taken by AFP, at least not until Mr Stride spoke to him in the Registry at the time of the inspection. Mr Houda did not have any personal dealings on 2 or 3 May with any lawyer from the DPP or any agency of the Commonwealth. The evidence suggested, perhaps rather obliquely, that Mr Houda may have overheard the conversation Mr Le Blond had with Mr Abdul-Karim during the lunch break on 3 May 2006. I am satisfied, however, that this was not so. Mr Le Blond, in his evidence, was emphatic that he had not communicated this matter to Mr Houda during the afternoon of 3 May 2006. Mr Houda was not, in a practical sense, privy to the call between Mr Lange and Kirby J’s Associate. He was present towards the end of that conversation, but did not hear the detail of it. Finally, I accept that when Mr Houda had the conversation with Mr Stride in the office, he also understood that Kirby J had granted access to the documents in the envelope, despite the AFP objection. 
     
      
    118 As with Mr Lange, I consider that criticisms of one kind or another may legitimately be levelled at Mr Houda, although they too fall well below the level of professional impropriety. First, I think that Mr Houda should have better instructed Mr Le Blond as to the proper procedure to be adopted in relation to the issue of subpoenas. Both solicitors shied away from the clearly desirable practice of letting other people know when a subpoena had been issued, especially in a matter that might involve national security information. Mr Le Blond relied on his rather limited experience in this regard. Mr Houda, who is considerably more experienced, seemed to think that it was unnecessary because the DPP or the Government Agencies would be likely to turn up, if there were to be a national security issue. I think it is clear that, in matters of this kind, it is desirable that notification be given to potentially interested parties when a subpoena is issued to a Court to produce documents, which may contain sensitive information. Secondly, I consider that Mr Houda should have involved himself more in the controversy that arose over 2 and 3 May 2006. He was, if you will, the master solicitor. He should have taken a more “hands on” role, particularly as his employed solicitor was relatively inexperienced. Moreover, I think Mr Lange would have benefited from more guidance and discussion with Mr Houda about the access problems that were arising. I accept that both men were very busy and that this played a part in a lack of communication between them. Thirdly, I think that when the inspection was taking place and the conversation took place with Mr Stride, Mr Houda might have, upon reflection, taken a different course. As with Mr Lange, I think that alarm bells should have rung at that stage at least. It is regrettable that they did not. But I cannot conclude that Mr Houda acted with any serious lack of professional propriety. 
     
      
    119 Mr Houda has honoured the undertakings he has given and he has complied with the Court orders. He has, in relation to other proceedings involving the Commonwealth, honoured his undertakings and displayed a professional attitude towards the protection of sensitive information. This is not to say that he always agrees with the Commonwealth’s position or with ASIO’s continued demand for secrecy and confidentiality. But, in the main, he has demonstrated that he does not pose an unacceptable risk in relation to the use or disclosure of confidential information. Although Mr Houda has had only very limited access to anything in the Warrant Affidavit, I consider that the offer of an undertaking to the Court should be accepted and that this will be sufficient in the circumstances to protect such confidential information as he has obtained. 
     
      
    120 In the case of both Mr Lange and Mr Houda, the evidence does not satisfy me that a fair minded, reasonably informed member of the public would conclude that the proper administration of justice requires that either of them should be prevented from acting in the trial of the accused. Their behaviour in this matter, although not free from criticism in the relatively limited ways I have indicated, falls well short of suggesting that they should be removed in the interests of the protection of the integrity of the judicial process. In this matter, Mr Khazaal’s fundamental right to the counsel and solicitor of his choice should be respected and the motion brought on behalf of the Commonwealth should be denied. 
     
      
       
      A final comment 
       
      
    121 During the hearing, I recommended to the parties that they shall endeavour to comprise the present dispute by putting in place an agreed protocol for their future conduct as between each other. Regrettably, that suggestion did not find favour with the parties. It had become quite apparent to me that, were the respondents to remain acting for the present accused and other persons accused of terrorism offences, there would need to be a fresh approach taken by both the Commonwealth and the respondents to both their ongoing relationship and their obligations towards each other. When the dust settles from the present proceedings, I would hope that such a protocol could be established. This is a two-way street. Something of a hostile attitude has emerged between the Commonwealth and the respondents. The respondents consider that the Commonwealth overstates its position on national security matters. The Commonwealth suspects that the respondents do not have a sufficient regard for matters of national security. These attitudes are inimical to the proper and satisfactory discharge of professional obligations. But in practical terms, the parties to this dispute may have to live with one another in this and many other trials. 
     
      
    122 I would renew my recommendation to the parties that, irrespective of the outcome of these proceedings, they ought establish a protocol for their future dealings so that the kind of problems that arose in this matter will not be repeated. In my view, the establishment of such a protocol will go a long way towards healing the rift between the parties. It will also go a long way towards reinstating the courteous and trusting relationship between them which is so important in professional dealings. Importantly, the establishment of such a protocol will be likely to enhance the protection of national security information, while at the same time ensuring that the rights of accused persons are paid due respect.

       S 474D APPLICATION 
       
       
      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: Ivan Robert Marko Milat has applied to the court for an order under s 474D of the Crimes Act for an inquiry into his conviction for one count of detaining for advantage and seven counts of murder. He has asked for an order referring the whole case to the Court of Criminal Appeal to be dealt with as an appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act (see Crimes Act s 474E(1)(b)). 
     
      
    2 This is the second application under s 474D made by the applicant. The first application was considered by Barr J and, in a judgment published on 27 October 2005, his Honour determined that the application should be refused. In the course of his Honour’s reasons he said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The procedure under s 474D of the  
        Crimes Act  
        is not intended to provide a convicted person with yet another avenue of appeal after the usual avenues have been exhausted. Where the matter raised in such an application has been fully dealt with in proceedings giving rise to the conviction, whether on appeal or otherwise, the court may refuse to consider or otherwise deal with the application; s 474E(3). It seems to me that for the most part the matters raised in this application have been dealt with at trial and on appeal. However, since some arguments have been put in the application which may possibly be different from arguments put elsewhere, I have considered it. I have no unease and no sense of disquiet in allowing the conviction to stand. No doubt or question about the guilt of the applicant arises on the material he relies on.” 
        
       
      
    3 The applicant made extensive submissions in the application considered by Barr J. His Honour’s distillation of those submissions disclosed the following ground on which the applicant sought his order: 
     
      
       
        
        “A miscarriage of justice occurred because the trial judge altered the Crown case after the close of evidence in a manner that lost the applicant a chance fairly open to him of being acquitted. This defect in the conduct of the trial was not given due weight by the Court of Criminal Appeal whose judgment therefore lacked integrity. The High Court of Australia failed to recognise that fact and erred in refusing special leave to appeal.” 
        
       
      
    4 The grounds advanced in the earlier petition were stated by the applicant as follows: 
     
      
       
      “1. The petitioner submits his convictions were the result of a substantial miscarriage of justice. 
       
       
      2. Adversarial criminal trial, the Onions count, the presented Crown case and the petitioner’s reply. 
       
       
      3. Unease over the trial judge and his conduct of the trial. 
       
       
      4. Evidence from the trial shows that a substantial miscarriage of justice occurred because of the defects and the conduct of the trial by the trial judge. That evidence was not given due weight by the Court of Criminal Appeal and brings into the question the integrity of the Court of Criminal Appeal’s decision on the matter. The Court of Criminal Appeal failed to fully investigate the ground that the trial judge erred when he put to the jury two possibilities, which were inadmissible evidence. 
       
       
      5. The High Court of Australia ruled that there was no doubting the correctness of the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal.” 
       
      
    5 The letter supporting the latest petition does not raise issues with the clarity which might be expected of a lawyer. I do not say this in order to criticise the applicant but to make plain that it is necessary again to seek to distil the essence of the applicant’s application. The following appears to me to be an appropriate summary. It follows the summary contained in the Crown submission in relation to this application. 
     
      
       
      1. That the trial judge directed the jury to act on evidence not established by the Crown. 
       
       
      2. That the trial judge allowed the prosecution to split its case. 
       
       
      3. That the trial judge, by way of his summing up, introduced evidence that was not established by the Crown at trial being the evidence of Mr Paul Onions. 
       
       
      4. That the various possibilities as regards the evidence of Paul Onions and what flowed from each possibility, as it was put to the jury, had the effect of misleading the jury. 
       
       
      5. That the mistaken evidence of Mr Paul Onions when he said that he saw a spare tyre mounted on the rear of the vehicle, as was the evidence also of Mrs Berry, represented a new allegation and that no contrary evidence to rebut the so-called mistaken evidence of Mr Paul Onions (and Mrs Berry) was adduced at the trial. 
       
       
      6. There was no evidence adduced at the trial that would entitle the trial judge to put the second possibility (regarding the evidence of Mr Onions) to the jury; and 
       
       
      7. The trial judge did not refer to the evidence of the first possibility (of the Paul Onions’ evidence) about seeing the spare tyre or the chrome wheel trims in as much as the jury was not reminded of Mr Onions’ reaction to such a question. 
       
      
    6 The Crown submitted that each of these grounds was raised by the petitioner in his earlier petition, has been the subject of previous submissions by him and was considered and dealt with by Barr J in his Honour’s reasons for the decision given on 27 October 2005. It was submitted that the particulars/grounds in the latest petition concerning the evidence of Mr Paul Onions (and Mrs Berry) relating to the appearance and characteristics of the 4WD vehicle, that he entered on 25 January 1990, have been fully considered beforehand. In the application considered by Barr J the “admitted” misdescription of certain characteristics of that 4WD vehicle, as acknowledged by the Crown at the trial, were said to have given rise to an error of law made by the trial judge in as much as he did not permit any opportunity to the petitioner to address such evidence. Because the trial judge allowed/permitted the jury to act upon such evidence, being identified as the first possibility and second possibility, this gave rise, so says the petitioner, to a departure from the rules of procedure by not requiring the Crown to establish that evidence. 
     
      
    7 I have carefully considered the applicant’s submissions. I have also reviewed the decision of Barr J and the earlier decisions of the Court of Criminal Appeal and the remarks on sentence of the trial judge. I am satisfied that each of the matters which the applicant now advances were considered by Barr J. In these circumstances I do not consider it necessary to provide lengthy reasons which would only be repetitive of determinations which have previously been made by this Court. 
     
      
    8 In relation to the submissions that the trial judge had directed the jury to act on evidence not established by the Crown the trial judge noted in his summing up: 
     
      
       
        
        “It has been pointed out … that is an unfortunate situation, and I do not propose to debate with anybody where the blame may lie. There were of course a number of matters which Mr Martin could have put to you in answer to that second possibility. The first thing is that it was not put to the accused himself in the course of cross-examination, when you may have been able to judge his spontaneous reaction to such a suggestion. It was not put to him either that he would have had access to such a vehicle which was similar to his own – which did not have a wheel on the back or chrome trims on the other wheels. If this argument had been put, Mr Martin may well have asked you why would the accused have used some other vehicle when he had his own?” 
        
       
      
    9 The reference by the trial judge to these matters had the effect that his Honour put to the jury matters which counsel for the petitioner might have submitted himself. Be that as it may, the critical matter is that there was in fact no additional evidence introduced by the Crown. Rather what was dealt with at this point of the trial was another perspective or point of view about evidence which had already been admitted in the case. The reference to “an unfortunate situation” related to the fact that neither party had addressed the jury on that additional perspective (or point of view). It should not be confused with any suggestion that there was additional evidence. 
     
      
    10 The petitioner has alleged, both in his present application, and in the earlier application that the trial judge “split the prosecution case”. This submission must be rejected. What happened at the trial was that the Crown Prosecutor made a submission about the contradiction between his witnesses’ recollection about the tyre and the contradictory case (as accepted by the Crown) put forward by the accused. The only sense in which the Crown case was “split” was that the trial judge had introduced another perspective, or point of view, about the evidence (as opposed to the introduction of evidence as such) about which neither party had addressed. 
     
      
    11 In his application the applicant submitted that there is a relevant doubt as to part of the evidence in the case based upon the proposition that the recollection of two Crown witnesses was defective. The Crown accepted that the witnesses’ recollection was wrong but this did not touch upon the evidence of Mr Onions linking the petitioner to the attack upon him. Barr J dealt with this matter when dismissing the earlier application. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “But even an unexplained error in the description of the attacker’s vehicle, and even a serious and unexplained discrepancy between the description of the attacker’s vehicle and the applicant’s vehicle, was not likely to determine the issue raised at trial. The evidence directly and indirectly linking the applicant to the attack on Mr Onions was remarkable in its breadth and detail. It will be recalled that Mr Onions got away from his attacker by the skin of his teeth, leaving in the attacker’s vehicle his backpack containing his distinctive shirt. That shirt was found with a shirt of the applicant’s at the house where the applicant was living. Both the applicant and the attacker had what Mr Onions called a “Merv Hughes” moustache. Mr Onions identified the applicant from a series of photographs. I do not find it necessary to review the whole of the evidence about the appearance and attributes of Mr Onions’ attacker. They are reviewed in the summing-up and the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal. I note the conclusion of Gleeson CJ, with whom the other members of the Court agreed, that the Crown case on the detention of Mr Onions was strong. I note again the important concession made by defence counsel which, as Hunt CJ at CL told the jury, meant that the Crown no longer had to exclude any reasonable possibility that the offender was or the offenders were outside the Milat family. In pronouncing sentence his Honour said this -  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘The case against the prisoner at the conclusion of the evidence and the addresses was, in my view, an overwhelming one. Although his legal representatives displayed a tactical ability of a high order, and conducted his defence in a skilful and responsible manner, in my view the jury's verdicts were, in the end, inevitable, I agree entirely with those verdicts. Any other, in my view, would have flown in the face of reality.’ “ 
          
         
        
       
      
    12 In response to the present application the Crown drew attention to the fact that the “first possibility” referred to that circumstance whereby Mr Onions was taken to be correct about everything in his description of the 4WD vehicle, except for the presence of a back tyre and chrome wheel trims, being errors on his part. The “second possibility” relates to that circumstance where the accused did pick up Mr Onions, but he (the petitioner) was not in his vehicle but one similar to it. 
     
      
    13 As the Crown pointed out, Barr J, when dealing with the earlier petition, made clear that the trial judge did not deal with this issue on a restricted basis, as the applicant asserts. In his reasons for decision Barr J said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The late emergence of the applicant’s evidence about when the chrome trims and the rear wheel were fitted to his vehicle left the Crown in an awkward position. I do not say so critically of the applicant and those who represented him. No doubt it suited them tactically to present the evidence in the manner in which they did, and that is something that they were entitled to do. That having been done, however, it is not open to the applicant to complain about the way the Crown responded.  
        
       
       
        
        The thrust of the applicant’s submissions is that his Honour left only two possibilities to the jury, either of which would leave the evidence of Mr Onions essentially undamaged, and that his Honour left for the jury’s consideration a submission (that the applicant might have been using someone else’s vehicle) favourable to the Crown case that the Crown had never made. As the extracts from the summing-up show, however, that submission is wrong. The parts of the summing-up relied on have been taken out of context. His Honour reminded the jury of the logical possibilities contended for and summarised the available arguments one way and the other.” 
        
       
      
    14 His Honour’s conclusion was: 
     
      
       
        
        “Not only has the applicant misled himself by taking so limited a view of what the trial judge said to the jury; he appears to have lost sight of the substantial point at issue at trial over this evidence. The kind of vehicle driven by the attacker was a matter incidental to a more important enquiry, namely the identity of the attacker. The principal Crown contention, dependent upon Mr Onions’ evidence, was that the applicant was his attacker. The evidence of the vehicle driven by the attacker was not, of course, unimportant. The Crown wished to establish the link in part by evidence which compared the vehicle driven by the attacker with the vehicle owned and generally used at the time by the applicant.” 
        
       
      
    15 The Crown’s ultimate submission was that each of the seven grounds advanced in the latest application have been the subject of specific grounds of appeal and adjudication in the Court of Criminal Appeal and ultimately considered by the High Court on a special leave application. In addition it was submitted that each of the grounds have been the subject of adjudication in the earlier petition. 
     
      
    16 In my opinion the Crown submission must be accepted. There is nothing in the material submitted by the applicant in support of his present application which provides a basis for concluding that there is a doubt or question as to his guilt or which otherwise represents a mitigating circumstance that would support the referral of this matter to the Court of Criminal Appeal. I have no unease and no sense of disquiet in allowing the convictions to stand. The material provided by the applicant does not raise a doubt or question about his guilt. 
     
      
    17 The application is refused.

      REMARKS ON SENTENCE 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: The offender, Alen Imbrisak, pleaded guilty before me to the following charges: 
     
      
       
        
        (1)  
        The murder of Lei Zainal at Darlinghurst on 30 November 2003; 
         
        (2) The manslaughter of Csaba Bognar at Marrickville between 17 and 19 December 2003; 
         
        (3) The malicious wounding of Bernadette Bognar, also at Marrickville, on 17 December 2003. 
         
        
       
      
    2 The charges relating to Csaba and Bernadette Bognar arise from the same incident. The offender had been indicted for the murder of Mr Bognar and the malicious wounding of Ms Bognar with intent to do her grievous bodily harm, but the Crown accepted pleas of guilty to the charges I have set out in satisfaction of that indictment. I received agreed statements of facts in respect of the three charges. 
     
      
       
      Murder 
       
      
    3 Dealing first with the murder of Mr Zainal, the deceased was a man of slight build in his mid-forties. He came to this country from Indonesia in 1994 to undertake university study. Unfortunately, he discontinued his studies in 1999, his visa expired, he was unable to work and was concerned that he would be deported. He was a single man with no dependents. 
     
      
    4 At the time of his death, he had been supporting himself by working as a transvestite prostitute in the Kings Cross area for about three years. He would pick up men and take them to a secluded area, where he would fellate them. There was evidence that he always told his clients that he was a man. 
     
      
    5 He met his death at the hands of the offender in the small hours of 30 November 2003. The only account of the circumstances is that which the offender gave to Dr Westmore, forensic psychiatrist, in March 2006. It will be necessary to return to that account and to the psychiatric evidence generally. Put briefly, it was that the deceased approached him, offering sexual services, that he assumed that the deceased was a woman until he realised from the pitch of his voice that he was not, and that he was affronted by being approached sexually by a man.  
     
      
    6 A condom was found at the scene from which DNA of the deceased and further DNA which could have been that of the offender was extracted, and from this it appears that there was sexual activity before the killing. What is clear is that the offender stabbed the deceased a number of times in his neck, his face, his left shoulder and both arms. There were four stab wounds to the neck, one cutting the carotid artery and another the jugular artery. 
     
      
    7 The deceased was seen staggering in the street until he fell. Passers-by summoned an ambulance and he was conveyed to St Vincent’s Hospital. He died about 20 minutes after his arrival there. A forensic pathologist concluded that the cause of death was blood loss resulting from multiple stab wounds to the head and neck. 
     
      
       
      Manslaughter / Malicious Wounding 
       
      
    8 Csaba Bognar is the father of Bernadette Bognar. The background to the offences against them is that, for several months in the later part of 2003, the offender had been living with them at their home unit in Marrickville. He was romantically interested in Bernadette Bognar, but she did not reciprocate his feelings. He left the unit in late November 2003, after she had made it clear that she did not wish an involvement with him. Thereafter he visited her father and her on several occasions. 
     
      
    9 On 16 December 2003 he came to the unit, bringing with him some expensive birthday presents for Bernadette. She told him that she would not accept them and that she did not want to encourage him in any way. He became upset and left the unit, leaving the presents behind.  
     
      
    10 In the early morning of the following day, 17 December 2003, he came to the unit and, after ringing the doorbell for an extended period of time, was admitted by Mr Bognar. The two men went to the lounge room where they remained for a time. At the same time Bernadette was showering in the ensuite bathroom attached to her bedroom. After her shower, and while still in her bedroom, she heard loud footsteps and crashing sounds coming from the direction of the lounge room, and she heard her father screaming out her name.  
     
      
    11 She went to the lounge room, to see her father standing against a lounge chair and the offender facing him, holding a knife. He had the knife raised above his head with the blade facing towards her father. Mr Bognar had his hands up and was trying to hold the offender’s arm, apparently in an effort to prevent him from stabbing him. Bernadette saw blood on her father’s clothing, as well as in the immediate vicinity. 
     
      
    12 Mr Bognar called out to her to get a knife and she went to the kitchen, removed two steak knives, and returned to the lounge room. She ran towards the offender and stabbed him in the forehead, causing him to fall onto a mattress in the lounge room. She stabbed him in the left arm and in the chest area, the knife broke, and she tried to gouge out his eyes. The offender stabbed her to her head, her left ear and her left little finger. The injuries to her ear and her finger required surgery. 
     
      
    13 Mr Bognar called to her to get out of the unit. She ran outside and sought assistance from neighbours. The offender left the unit shortly afterwards. He was later arrested and conveyed to hospital. Mr Bognar himself made his way to the street, where he was assisted by Bernadette and by neighbours. He also was taken to hospital, where he died two days later. He had sustained multiple stab wounds to his head, his neck and other parts of his body. It was the wounds to his neck and his head, leading to severe haemorrhaging in the brain, which caused his death. 
     
      
    14 The offender’s account of the manslaughter of Mr Bognar is set out in the agreed statement of facts. Put briefly, it is that there had been an altercation between the two men before Bernadette came to the lounge room. What led to the altercation is not clear. Mr Bognar left the room, returned with a kitchen knife and attacked the offender. There was a struggle, during which the offender suffered defensive wounds to his right hand. As I understand it, the offender gained possession of the knife and he then stabbed the deceased a number of times. 
     
      
    15 The plea of guilty to manslaughter was entered, and accepted, on the basis of excessive self-defence. The offender believed that what he did was necessary to defend himself, but concedes that it was not a reasonable response to the circumstances as he perceived them: s421 of the Crimes Act. The Crown prosecutor accepted the plea because the offender was the only person who could give an account of what occurred at the relevant time. Moreover, observations at the scene and injuries to his hand were consistent with that account. 
     
      
       
      Subjective Case 
       
      
    16 The offender was 29 years old at the time of his offences, and he is now 32. He has a lengthy criminal record, dating from 1992, consisting mainly of drug offences and offences of dishonesty. He has served a number of short terms of imprisonment, but in 2001 he was sentenced to imprisonment for three years with a non-parole period of 18 months for assaulting a police officer in the execution of his duty. That is the only significant offence of violence on his record. He was arrested in respect of the Bognar matters on 17 December 2003 and has remained in custody since that day. He was later charged with the murder of Mr Zainal.  
     
      
    17 He was born in Croatia, and came to this country with his family when he was four years old. He was brought up by his mother and his stepfather, and has never known his biological father. He told Dr Westmore that his stepfather was violent towards him when he was younger, and that he frequently ran away from home and truanted. He did not fare well at school, and left after year 10. He worked as an apprentice chef for some years but, because he had difficulty with examinations, he never completed the apprenticeship. Nevertheless, he continued to work in that industry.  
     
      
    18 Apart from his romantic interest in Bernadette Bognar, he had had two relationships with women, both of which lasted about 12 months. Otherwise, his social network did not extend beyond associates he had met while in prison, and he was something of a “loner”. However, he appears to have maintained some contact with his family, and during his present period of custody he has been visited by his older sister. 
     
      
    19 He began using illicit drugs in his mid-teens. Over the years, he has used cannabis, heroin and cocaine. It is not his case that he had been using drugs at the time of the incident involving the Bognars, but he told Dr Westmore that he had injected cocaine before the killing of Mr Zainal. Since being in custody he has been on a methadone program. 
     
      
    20 Dr Westmore had two consultations with the offender, producing reports of October 2005 and March 2006. He is hepatitis C positive and reported having difficulties with his liver. He gave a history of being diagnosed with schizophrenia in 1998 and 1999. On both occasions he was put on antipsychotic medication and his symptoms abated. He had had no psychiatric treatment since. He told Dr Westmore that, at the time he killed Mr Zainal, he was depressed and was hearing voices. He associated that psychiatric phenomenon with his use of cocaine. 
     
      
    21 Dr Westmore noted his history of polysubstance abuse and arrived at a provisional diagnosis of a psychotic disorder. He also considered the offender to be suffering from an antisocial personality disorder, based on the nature and extent of his criminal history. He thought it likely that his use of illicit drugs would lead to a decline in his general level of functioning. 
     
      
    22 At Dr Westmore’s suggestion, the offender was examined by Professor David Sillence, Professor of Medical Genetics at the University of Sydney. The professor provided a report, to which it is not necessary to refer in any detail. It is sufficient to say that he examined whether the offender had a genetic disorder, in the light of his history of learning difficulties and his physical appearance. He found that history “highly suggestive” of such a disorder, but chromosomal testing was normal and he could reach no firm conclusion about the matter. 
     
      
    23 The fact that the offender killed twice within a relatively short period of time requires attention to whether he might be a continuing danger to the community, a question which Dr Westmore examined in his 2006 report. The doctor was concerned about the offender’s somewhat callous account of the circumstances leading to the death of Mr Zainal, and felt that there may be “concerns about his future behaviour towards transgender people” if he should be approached in a sexual way by such a person. That view, however, was expressed tentatively. Otherwise, the doctor noted that the two killings were unconnected and occurred in very different circumstances, and that the offender’s criminal history contains no entry for anything approaching the seriousness of the present offences. Generally, he found nothing in his history to suggest that he had “the psychological profile of a ‘serial killer’”.  
     
      
    24 Dr Westmore strongly recommended that the offender refrain from using any illicit drugs in the future, “as the use of drugs may precipitate psychotic symptoms in him and may impair his judgment and increase any propensity he might have to act impulsively”. The doctor also thought that he needed “extended therapy” to ascertain the full extent of his psychological problems, noting that he would be unlikely to receive therapy of that kind in custody. 
     
      
       
      Sentencing 
       
      
    25 I have had the benefit of comprehensive written submissions by the Crown prosecutor and oral submissions from Mr Spencer, counsel for the offender.  
     
      
    26 The murder of Mr Zainal carries a maximum sentence of imprisonment for life, and a standard non-parole period of 20 years. Without minimising the seriousness of the offence, it clearly does not call for the imposition of the maximum sentence. As will be seen, I also consider that there are reasons for departing from the standard non-parole period. 
     
      
    27 The killing was brutal and the motive for it is difficult to determine. The only explanation for the offender’s behaviour is that which he proffered to Dr Westmore, that is, that he was affronted by sexual contact with a person he discovered to be of his own sex. This is hardly an adequate explanation for his attack upon the unfortunate Mr Zainal, and it affords no significant mitigation of his crime. Moreover, by the nature of his lifestyle as a prostitute and the secluded area in which he had to ply his trade, the victim was vulnerable to violence and to serious injury. 
     
      
    28 On the other hand, there is nothing to suggest that the killing was planned. It was clearly spontaneous, and its very ferocity demonstrates that the offender was not thinking rationally at the time. I accept that he was in a disturbed state of mind induced, as he told Dr Westmore, by the ingestion of a prohibited drug. Having said that, the fact that he was affected by a drug is not of itself a mitigating factor in the circumstances of the case, and the evidence does not raise the special considerations concerning the sentence of mentally disordered people considered in cases such as R v Engert (1995) 84 A Crim R 67.  
     
      
    29 I approach the question of the standard non-parole period guided by the now familiar principles enunciated in R v Way (2004) 60 NSWLR 168 at [117]ff. The relevant factors from that case and from subsequent cases were summarised by Simpson J in R v AJP (2004) 150 A Crim R 575 at [13]. If it were necessary to express where the crime lies in the scale of objective gravity, I would place it at or about the mid-range. However, it is not necessary to express any concluded view about that because the offender’s plea of guilty and aspects of his subjective case, to which I shall refer later, provide sufficient reason to depart from the standard non-parole period. Nevertheless, that period remains relevant as a “sounding board” or “guide post” in the manner in explained in Way at [122]. 
     
      
    30 The offender pleaded guilty to the murder on the day the case was fixed for trial. However, his legal representatives had then only recently been supplied with certain additional statements relevant to the Crown case. It could fairly be said, as the Crown prosecutor acknowledged, that he pleaded guilty when the totality of the Crown case was made known to him. I would recognise the utilitarian value of the plea by reducing the sentence otherwise appropriate by 15%. There was a strong Crown case, including admissions said to have been made to Bernadette Bognar. Nevertheless, the Crown prosecutor acknowledged, very properly, that the plea also demonstrates a measure of remorse. 
     
      
    31 Turning to the manslaughter of Mr Bognar, that offence carries a maximum sentence of imprisonment for 25 years. In practice, the range of sentence for manslaughter is very wide as the offence embraces an almost infinite variety of circumstances. Nevertheless, it is by its nature a serious offence because, whatever the circumstances, it involves the unlawful taking of a human life. 
     
      
    32 As I have said, what led to the altercation between the two men is unclear. The most that can be said, based upon the offender’s account to Dr Westmore, is that it was in some way connected to his relationship with Bernadette Bognar. However that may be, the plea was accepted on the basis that the deceased, Mr Bognar, was the initial aggressor and that the offender was acting in self-defence, although his response was excessive. Generally speaking, it can be said that manslaughter through excessive self-defence is one of the less serious categories of that crime. However, each case much be assessed on its own facts. While acknowledging the fear and sense of urgency which the offender must have experienced, proper regard must be had to the high level of violence which accompanied his response. 
     
      
    33 The malicious wounding of Bernadette Bognar carries a maximum sentence of seven years imprisonment. That offence also must be understood in the light of its unusual circumstances. Here again, the offender’s actions were an urgent response to Ms Bognar’s entirely understandable attack upon him in an attempt to protect her father. That said, the injuries she sustained were quite serious. 
     
      
    34 The pleas of guilty to these charges were entered at a late stage of the proceedings but, again, the Crown prosecutor conceded that they were offered when the whole of the Crown case was made known to the offender. For them I would also allow a discount of sentence of 15%. The Crown prosecutor acknowledged that they too demonstrate a measure of remorse. 
     
      
    35 As already observed, the offender’s lengthy criminal record contains no offence of violence of the order of those for which he now stands for sentence. Nevertheless, in the light of that criminal history, I must be guarded about his prospects of rehabilitation. I am also concerned about his psychiatric history and the fact, as it appears from the reports of Dr Westmore, that there remains a measure of uncertainty about the extent of his psychological problems and about his prognosis.  
     
      
    36 Having said that, the offender presents as a sad and isolated figure, the product of a difficult background. He faces for the first time a long period of custody, during which I can but hope that his personal problems, including his propensity to drug abuse, can be addressed professionally. It is obviously important that he have the opportunity in due course for conditional release into the community for an extended period, subject to supervision and the sanction of parole. I propose to structure the sentences which I must pass to that end. 
     
      
    37 If he is afforded the treatment and support which he requires, I believe that he has fair prospects of rehabilitation. Certainly, in the light of his background and the degree of remorse evidenced by his pleas of guilty, and assisted by the views of Dr Westmore, I think that it is unlikely that he would commit further offences of serious violence. 
     
      
    38 It was common ground that the sentences for the manslaughter of Mr Bognar and the malicious wounding of his daughter should be wholly concurrent, as the offences were closely related and arose from the same incident. Mr Spencer accepted that there must be some accumulation upon those sentences of the sentence for the murder of Mr Zainal, but counsel agreed that partial accumulation would be appropriate in recognition of the familiar principle of totality. 
     
      
    39 This is best achieved, as the Crown prosecutor submitted, by passing fixed terms of imprisonment for the manslaughter and malicious wounding and a sentence with a non-parole period for the murder. Accordingly, I would not fix non-parole periods for the Bognar offences because of the partial accumulation of the murder sentence. I shall assess the fixed terms by reference to what would have been the appropriate head sentences, rather than the non-parole periods which might have been fixed.  
     
      
    40 But for the pleas of guilty, I would have imposed sentences of twenty-two years for the murder, eight years for the manslaughter and three years for the malicious wounding. Rounding off figures after allowing a 15% reduction for the pleas, the sentences will be eighteen-and-a-half years, seven years and two-and-a-half years respectively. 
     
      
    41 I find special circumstances in respect of the sentence for the murder, because of the accumulation and because of the aspects of the offender’s subjective case to which I have referred. However, any departure from the normal statutory proportion must be modest. The non-parole period for that offence must itself reflect the gravity of that crime, and the effective non-parole period resulting from the partial accumulation must be sufficient to mark the totality of the offender’s criminality. The sentences I propose will still leave the offender with a lengthy period of parole eligibility.  
     
      
    42 Alen Imbrisak, for the manslaughter of Csaba Bognar you are sentenced to imprisonment for seven years, to date from 17 December 2003 and to expire on 16 December 2010. For the malicious wounding of Bernadette Bognar, you are sentenced to imprisonment for two-and-a-half years, also to date from 17 December 2003 and to expire on 16 June 2006. I decline to set non-parole periods in respect of either of those sentences.  
     
      
    43 For the murder of Lei Zainal you are sentenced to imprisonment for eighteen-and-a-half years, comprising a non-parole period of thirteen-and-a-half years, to commence on 17 June 2008 and to expire on 16 December 2021, and a balance of term of five years, to commence on 17 December 2021 and to expire on 16 December 2026. 
     
      
    44 The overall sentence, then, is imprisonment for twenty-three years, commencing on 17 December 2003 and expiring on 16 December 2026. You will be eligible for release on parole after eighteen years, that is, on 16 December 2021.

    SENTENCE1 HIS HONOUR: One of the most important features to be considered when determining an appropriate sentence for an offender is the likelihood that that offender will commit further offences. That matter is of course relevant to the extent to which the sentence needs to reflect an element of personal deterrence. It is also relevant to things such as retribution. In turn one of the most important features in assessing the likelihood that an offender will commit further offences is the extent to which the offender accepts responsibility for what he has done and acknowledges the extent to which it is a breach of the law. 2 In this case the offender has pleaded guilty to an offence of intimidating with intent to cause fear of physical or mental harm. To that extent he accepts his responsibility for committing a criminal offence, but in many other areas he demonstrates a remarkable lack of candour. He demonstrates a lack of insight into the wrongfulness of his conduct and he frankly has tried to pull the wool over my eyes. I will explain in more detail later why it is that I have reached that conclusion. 3 The offender and a woman by the name of Clare Talbot began a relationship in about February 2003. The statement of facts records that the relationship began to experience difficulties soon after it commenced. One of those difficulties involved the offender committing an offence of assault occasion actual bodily harm upon Ms Talbot on 29 October 2003. He was placed on a bond for that offence. He was in fact on a bond at the time of the commission of the offence for which he is now to be sentenced which he committed on 5 March 2006.4 On that day Ms Talbot had been receiving a number of, what were described in the statement of facts as, prank calls. Ms Talbot had been out with a man by the name of Boyd. When they got back to Ms Talbot’s home they discovered that the lights did not work. She checked the power box outside and discovered that the main switch had been turned off. She turned the power back on and she and Mr Boyd entered the house. He left his leather jacket on a lounge and then left the home to buy cigarettes. Ms Talbot did not lock the door after him so that he could get back in. About ten minutes later Ms Talbot heard her dogs barking at something in the front room of her house. She walked to the front room to find the offender there. She, not surprisingly, told him in emphatic terms to leave her home. The offender simply said “Who’s here?” He walked past her and began checking out the various rooms. Clearly, he was intending to identify whether Ms Talbot was with another man. Despite Ms Talbot continually telling him to leave her house he did not do so. 5 When he saw Mr Boyd’s jacket in the front room he picked it up and said “Whose jacket is this?” Ms Talbot said quite accurately, “None of your business.” The offender took the jacket and left the home. Ms Talbot dialled 000 straight away. The offender was arrested shortly thereafter when he went to Redfern Police Station.6 The offender claims to the author of the presentence report tendered in this case that he was concerned about Ms Talbot’s health and that is what it was that prompted him to go to her home. I reject that in emphatic terms. It is a completely dishonest statement. What the offender was concerned about was whether Ms Talbot was with another man. He was, not to put to finer a point on it, jealous. A person who is concerned for another’s welfare, upon seeing that person does not say whose here but says how are you. 7 The statement of facts records that the accused was not in the least interested in Ms Talbot’s welfare or health. A person interested in another person’s health does not search that person’s home before leaving with a jacket obviously belonging to a man. The author of the presentence report seems to have accepted the offender’s version as to what he was doing in Ms Talbot’s home. I do not. There is other evidence to suggest the offender is a person who will tell lies in order to advance his position depending on how he considers the listener will respond to his statements. To the author of the presentence report he says that he has ceased all contact with the victim and has accepted that the relationship cannot continue. I know that the former of those statements is not true and I have grave suspicions that the latter is also not true. 8 Ms Talbot wrote a letter addressed to me. It was tendered by Mr Pontello. It says  
     
      
      “I have seen Matthew since the incident”. 
      
    9 The offender was also interviewed by Dr Robert Hampshire. In contrast to the suggestion the offender made towards the author of the presentence report, he told Mr Hampshire that he continues to carry the hope of marrying Ms Talbot, although he is understandably cautious about moving forward with her. 10 It is apparent that the author of the presentence report interviewed Mr Rickard’s close friends, or at least one close friend. It was said that he has conservative 1950s values. Clearly, those values do not extend to a simple acceptance of responsibility for his misconduct. 11 Mr Pontello in his written submissions suggests that it is a mitigating feature of this offence that the intimidation did not involve any assault upon Ms Talbot. It is not a mitigating feature of one offence that a more serious offence was not committed. This offence was a very serious one. Ms Talbot was entitled to feel safe in her own home, free from the unwanted attentions of the offender who simply could not accept that his relationship with Ms Talbot was over. 12 The letter from Ms Talbot, as well as telling me that the offender had lied to the probation and parole officer regarding the lack of contact between them, also says that the offender has accepted that the relationship is over and that they have moved on with their own lives separately. Again, I have grave suspicions that that is simply the offender saying he realises what should be said in order to receive a lower sentence. 13 Mr Pontello relies also on the fact that this is an offence that could be dealt with summarily. That is the case and I will take that matter into account. In this case I will not impose a sentence which extends beyond the jurisdictional limit of the Local Court. 14 I had intended to mention, but had forgotten to do so until now, that I am also satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender was the one who switched off the power to Ms Talbot’s home. I find, that that is the only reasonable possible explanation for the circumstance that Ms Talbot had found that her power had been switched off and that shortly thereafter the offender turns up in her home, unwanted and uninvited. I note in this context that the offender is an electrician. 15 The offender pleaded guilty to this offence at what is apparently an early stage and so I will discount the sentence I would otherwise have imposed by twenty-five per cent to reflect that fact. I do not accept that the offender is remorseful. I do not accept that he has good prospects of rehabilitation and I do not accept that he is unlikely to re-offend. Those three findings are based on the matters that I began these remarks on sentence with, that is a complete failure on behalf of the offender to fully accept what he has done. 16 This was planned activity. It appears that the offender was laying in wait for Ms Talbot to return home. He had switched off the power and waited until he could gain entry to the home without Ms Talbot realising it. It was also aggravated by the circumstance that the offender was on a bond at the time. That supervision under that bond was terminated only a relatively short time before the offender committed this offence. 17 It is to be noted that when the offender attended a St Vincent De Paul program targeting domestic violence he was withdrawn from the program after thirty-two weeks due to his pattern of disruptive behaviour and lack of identified progress in developing insight into his offending behaviour. However, he appears to have improved his attitude once he received individual counselling which he attended as directed. 18 The offender has had a number of relationships over the years. I summarise them by saying that it appears that he has been unlucky in love. That may explain, but in no way excuses, what appears to have been his excessive behaviour involving Ms Talbot on the night of this offence. He is employed and appears to have been a man of otherwise good character. I will take that matter into account significantly in his favour. There are suggestions in Dr Hampshire’s report that the offender was recovering from a period of depression, which at the time of this offence was not being treated by medication. 19 I have given anxious consideration as to the form of the punishment that I should impose in this case. It is accepted by Mr Pontello that a custodial sentence of some form is required. I accept that that is the case. I have determined the appropriate sentence and then turned to my mind to the way in which that sentence should be served. 20 This is a case where there needs to be a very significant element of personal deterrence visited upon the offender. I do not consider that he, himself, recognises how wrong his conduct was. It needs to be brought home to him by a significant sentence therefore, that if he continues to act in a way that he does not really accept is wrong, he will be punished and punished severely. 21 I gave serious consideration to imposing a sentence of fulltime custody upon the offender. However, I will not do so. The offender’s good work history and his lack of serious earlier offending are the two features which have persuaded me not to impose a sentence of fulltime custody. But the offender should consider himself very lucky at the sentence I will shortly impose. I have got no doubt that some would regard the sentence I am about to announce as being lenient in light of the offender’s attitude towards the offence itself. 22 The offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of eighteen months with a head sentence of two years. That sentence is to be served by way of periodic detention. The offender is to attend the Parramatta Periodic Detention Centre on Saturday week the date of which is 23 December 2006 in order to commence serving his sentence. That is the sentence I should make clear for the offence of stalking. 23 For the offence of larceny where I note the jacket was returned I will sentence the offender to imprisonment for six months. That is a fixed term. It is also to be served by way of periodic detention concurrently with the other sentence.

    SENTENCE1 HIS HONOUR: Elle Saliba was born in 1967, in a few days time he will be thirty-nine years old. His first and only previous offence was in 1986 when he was conveyed in a stolen motor vehicle, for this offence he received a s 558 recognisance to be of good behaviour for three years. Until today he had not been before a court again.2 Today he is before this Court in respect of three break and enter offences. In respect of two of those he has been committed for sentence, in respect of a third he asks it be taken into account on a Form 1.3 It would seem, as the matter came to me, the offences on which he has been committed were not accurately identified. There are also two receiving stolen property accounts and he asks pursuant to s 167 Criminal Procedure Act that I deal with the following further offences that he was driving whilst his licence was suspended and that he was in possession of housebreaking implements. There are four matters of furnishing a false statement in respect of goods which apparently were pledged to cash converters and two further matters of receiving stolen property.4 All of the offending conduct I am dealing with appears to have occurred in two groups; a series of offences over some days in early May and another series of offences over some days in early July this year. Although this would not fit the usual pattern of offending by drug offenders committing crime for drug money, the offender says on his oath that all of his offending conduct is before the Court.5 The offender has come before the Court to answer his criminality today. Given the unusual circumstances of this case, that is that the offences are committed by a thirty-eight year old with an otherwise virtually clean record, the ultimate sentencing outcome will depend significantly upon the offender’s rehabilitation prospects and whether he can demonstrate that he is capable of staying off the drugs.Facts6 Each of the break and enters appears to have been committed during daylight time. During the break and enter on 11 July the offender was seen by neighbours, police were contacted and he was arrested shortly thereafter. There appears to be some damage occasioned on each occasion, certainly as to two of them, to gain entry.7 Small items generally were taken including a camera, a wallet, jewellery, watch, Sony PlayStation, two game consoles, a Game Boy, portable DVD player, a DVD player, DVDs, PlayStations, porcelain dolls, cosmetics, clothing and a suitcase containing some other property. Some of these items were pledged without much regard to their actual value or the sentimental value to their owners. He received items of a similar nature which he pawned during May, claiming at the time that he pawned them that the items were his.Mental Health Issues8 At the time of the offences his life had been on a gradual downslide. It maybe appropriate to mark that downslide as being noticeable about the time he contracted encephalitis, that is in August of 2002. It is likely to have started earlier, but the expression of it in his daily life may have begun about then. He is recorded as being concerned that he may have had cognitive deficits, particularly relating to memory and thinking, occurring as a consequence of that serious bout of encephalitis. That he sought medical attention for it demonstrates he was clearly worried. Such loses can be a sequelae, as I understand it, to encephalitis.9 His reviewer at the time observed that he had performed adequately in all cognitive domains and generally within expectation based on his average estimated premorbid level of function. He demonstrated adequate auditory attention span, working memory, speed of thinking, receptive and expressive language, visio-spatial skills and what those working with the mind call executive functions, these include verbal reasoning, problem solving and organising.10 He did appear to suffer from cognitive fatigue, meaning that he had difficulty sustaining his concentration effort for long periods of time. The reviewer formed the opinion that the results overall were encouraging and revealed no evidence of a decline in his memory or other aspects of cognition since contracting encephalitis. She remarked however that Mr Saliba’s elevated levels of stress, anxiety and depression were of some concern. 11 Cognitive fatigue is not the same as loss of cognitive ability. It would appear Mr Saliba was generally within expectations of what was expected of him, if not better than what was expected of him. The cognitive fatigue may well have been a sequelae to encephalitis, whether it has resolved or not is not stated in the subsequent psychological assessment obtained for this hearing. What is significant in the 2002 report is the presence of anxiety, stress and depression. They, it seemed to me, were indicators of underlying problems.12 The offender was referred by Ms Hall of the Legal Aid to Emma Collins, a forensic psychologist. She conducts her practice with Dr Lennings, also a well known psychologist. She remarks that the offender is a thirty-eight year old Lebanese born Australia citizen, currently living with a brother. Has no current relationship, although at the time of the offending claimed that one of his alleged co-offenders was his girlfriend. He gives evidence that relationship has now ended.Family Background, Social Dynamics13 He is the eldest of four children, there are two younger twin brothers and a younger sister. He was raised in Lebanon until about eight or nine, then relocated to this country. My understanding is that there was some time in Melbourne and then they moved up here - I do not know where I got that from though. There was a period when he was raised by his paternal grandparents and his view of what occurred during that time was that his paternal grandmother sought to distance him from his mother.14 Elle Saliba’s relationship with his father as a child was difficult. The young Saliba often felt that he was blamed for things that his siblings had done and punished by his father for them. It was, and still is apparently, his view that his father’s discipline was excessive at times and that he felt he had to “walk on eggshells” around his father.15 He claims acquaintances but no close friends during his school years. There was a claim that some of his school peers bullied him, but that he was able, as it were, to stand up for himself, because he generally fought back. Education, Skills, Employment16 He went to Canterbury Boys High School and did not enjoy that experience. There were language problems impacting upon some of his class grades and he lost motivation. It was during high school that he began to truant. It was during high school that he experimented with cannabis. He passed his School Certificate, was not satisfied with the grades and sought to redo it, but abandoned that after a few months.17 He worked after leaving school and then began a pre-apprentice course at TAFE, ultimately got himself a panel beating apprenticeship and is still working in that trade.18 There was a period when he was on sickness benefits for five months in 2002 and subsequently he took a year off because he was “sick of life”. But he, more recently, (three months when this report was done) had been back in panel beating. That would seem to me to be August of this year.Factors leading to Depression19 He and his wife lived together from '96 to 2003, after that he moved away, living with his family. He told Emma Collins that the marriage dissolved in 2003 because of his longstanding mood swings and he instigated the break up, saying that he could not continue in such a way in the relationship. The account that he gave in Court is significantly different from that.20 The significance is two-fold, one, the account is factually different, but secondly, it is consequentially different. In Court he said that it was really family tension coupled with the fact that he had married his wife because she was pregnant and that really it was a fact he should not have married her and that there were, as I understand it, tensions ongoing in the marriage where the blame may well have fallen evenly on both or perhaps even towards the wife. But in the report from Emma Collins, he seems to be accepting all of the blame.21 He says that the separation was initially messy, but that currently he has an amicable relationship with his wife. He can see his children when he wishes and they stay with him each weekend.22 He felt that he had become isolated from others, spending time at home in bed alone. He claimed to feel quite emotional during the period. He did not feel that he would gain any benefit from what is called psychotropic treatment at that time, that is presumably when he was feeling alone in 2003. When he tried it recently, it did not help improve his low mood. He has entertained suicide as an idea and those experiences were exacerbated by his encephalitis. If that be so, then those experiences must have pre-existed the encephalitis with the depression there before the encephalitis.Drug Abuse23 He claims regular substance abuse from the age of twenty-four, initially with cannabis from '91 to '96, although he had experimented with cannabis at thirteen. He stopped using cannabis when his eldest daughter was born and only used it occasionally thereafter. He had tried amphetamines and cocaine socially, but no more regular use than that. He was not a great consumer of alcohol, probably every couple of weeks, he was not a binge drinker.24 He begins, in late 2005, using heroin intravenously claiming he was introduced to it by a friend at a time when he was feeling unwell. There was some use of benzodiazepines. He had not accessed any form of rehabilitation. His evidence is that he, particularly since his arrest, has been motivated, probably by the charges and the potential gaol sentence, to cease heroin dependency.Source of Stress25 What is interesting about that is that he does not seem to me to reveal to Ms Collins, the major stresses that were going on in his life in 2005 and perhaps before. Firstly, there may be some unresolved matters relating to his separation from his parents and the undermining of the family relationship by his paternal grandmother. Secondly there may be issues relating to his relationship with his father and perhaps feelings of guilt, particularly bearing in mind that the father is in the final stages of a terminal cancer. There may be senses of frustration by him that his father is going and that there is little he can do about it.26 His brother, at the beginning of the year, the brother with whom he is living, was involved in a motorcycle accident in which he was seriously injured and there was concern for some time as to whether he would be wheelchair bound or not. It would appear that there was some significant spinal damage and that the remedy has required support to the spine, if I have understood it correctly, by way of a couple of rods being inserted. And there are marriage tensions and inevitably, although Family Law seeks to move away from this, the question of accepting and understanding why it was that the marriage has broken down without the need for blaming necessarily.27 None of these issues appear to me to have been addressed. One can’t of course exclude the possibility that the depression is not what is called a reactive depression, it may well be one which is congenital, that is some genes may have been passed on that dispose him to depression. It seems to me that his rehabilitation prospects are very much tied up with him coming to grips with whatever it is that is causing him to be sad and that whatever it is is causing him, or caused him to look initially to cannabis and subsequently to heroin for relief.28 It may be that there is a need for some medication, either over a temporary period or permanently, one does not know until the matter is addressed. What we do know is that there are many people in the community now who are beginning to accept the proposition that they experience depression and are beginning to come to grips with it. If this offender does not come to grips with it at the age of thirty-eight, he may be just on the threshold of a criminal career rather than hopefully having engaged in criminal conduct during a bad time.Rehabilitation Issues29 Since the offence it would appear that he has done much which points towards his rehabilitation prospects being better than reasonable. He says that he has withdrawn from heroin and cannabis. He has indicated to the Court that on two occasions he was attracted to the prospect of using heroin again to a point where he actually jumped in the car and drove there, at least on one occasion, or drove halfway there, thought about it and withdrew yet again. Although as I say, perhaps not withdrawn from the causes. He is on better relationships with his former partner, that he is employed in a situation where there is a real possibility of obtaining an actual legal interest in the business.30 Were I to sentence him now, it seems to me that because I cannot be confident the rehabilitation would continued, I would be compelled to send a man, who at the age of thirty-eight had not been to gaol before, to that very place. He would be a novice in gaol and I have no doubt would find it an extremely scary place. Men bigger and tougher than him who had been in gaol much longer than he, although younger than he, would very shortly manipulate him one way or another.31 That of course has not been ruled out as the final option, but it seems to me that if he could demonstrate a continuation of the rehabilitation that he started, other options become available. For that reason I intend to adjourn these proceedings for a period of twelve months from today. I intend to require him to appear in my court on three occasions during that twelve month period to assure myself of two things; firstly that the community is not endangered by this boldness on my part and secondly that the rehabilitation that I am looking for is progressing, because if it is not progressing, it is better that we do not waste our time.32 The conditions that I will set will ensure, hopefully, two things; that the causes of the drug abuse begin to be addressed and secondly that the drug abuse itself will stop so that the safety of the community is thereby ensured. If at the end of twelve months I am confident that the rehabilitation can be achieved and is being achieved, it seems to me that an option that immediately commends itself is some form of suspended sentence, but we can cross that bridge when we get there.S11 Bail and Conditions33 Pursuant to s 11 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act I grant the offender bail for the purpose of demonstrating that rehabilitation is taking place and can continue to take place. The conditions of that bail are that he will accept supervision by Probation and Parole, that he will accept the reasonable directions of his case manager with Probation and Parole in respect of counselling, particularly related to causes of his drug abuse, drug prevention strategies and personal counselling. He will submit to random drug testing four times monthly. That at the direction of Probation and Parole and within four hours of being so directed, he will attend upon a practitioner and submit himself to urine testing or other form of drug testing, there is a saliva form now. Any failure so to do is deemed a breach of the bail. Any dirty test is likewise deemed a breach of the bail. Probation and Parole is requested to advise me of any breach of bail within forty-eight hours of that breach. He remain of good behaviour. At the progress reports he obtain a report from his employers, any counsellor he privately engages and I order updated pre-sentence reports. 34 He can appear, these are the dates I suggest, 20 April here at Parramatta, 24 August at a court to be advised and 14 December next year at a court to be advised for the final sentence hearing.

    SENTENCE1 HIS HONOUR: Kylie Tregonning appears for sentence today having pleaded guilty to one offence of break, enter and steal, and one offence of larceny. When I sentence her for the break, enter and steal matter she asks that I take into account two matters on the Form 1. One is related to the break, enter and steal and is an offence of unlawfully entering onto enclosed lands. The other is completely unrelated, it is a further but earlier offence of break, enter and steal.2 The offences of 26 April 2006 all occurred when the offender was under the influence of a significant quantity of drugs. It is clear that she was intoxicated by drugs due to a particular circumstance I will shortly describe. She appears to have entered the enclosed lands of 204 Crown Street, Darlinghurst on her way to 206 Crown Street, Darlinghurst, which is the premises which she broke into. They were occupied by a woman by the name of Gwenda Schreiber. Ms Schreiber was actually at home performing her occupation as a psychologist at the time that Ms Tregonning forced her way into the premises. Ms Schreiber heard the noises of that forced entry but disregarded them for a while until her consultation was completed. At that stage she heard some more noises and noticed that things had been stolen. She then contacted police who eventually arrived, but not until after Ms Schreiber became quite anxious for her safety in the knowledge that she could hear noises from upstairs and that the person who was making those noises was not deterred by the fact that Ms Schreiber had activated her house alarm.3 When police arrived they saw a number of things, including items belonging to Ms Schreiber strewn about the house and also outside. They also heard thumping noises. They quickly identified where those noises came from and saw the offender standing on the roof of the kitchen. She was both holding a number of bags and wearing a fancy dress sailor’s hat that belonged to Ms Schreiber’s daughter. That latter circumstance alone is testament to the intoxicating effect of the drugs that the offender had earlier taken. She was cooperative with the police who arrested her. A lot of the property taken from Ms Schreiber’s home was recovered but a lot more was not.4 Some of the property not recovered obviously had significant emotional value for Ms Schreiber. She reports that she is now much more anxious than she was before and has in fact moved from the premises as a result of what occurred there. The effects that Ms Schreiber felt are entirely foreseeable and entirely understandable from having her home broken into by the offender. This, although it is a prevalent crime, is a very serious one indeed. The measure of its seriousness is not simply in the value of the property taken and not recovered. Its effects extend far beyond that. 5 As part of their investigation into this offence police noticed that the offender was in possession of items which had not been taken from Ms Schreiber’s home. It was later discovered that they were taken from a backpack which had been stolen by the offender. The owner of the backpack was working on St Kinesis Church in Roslyn Gardens and left his backpack in a room within the Church complex. The offender has clearly entered that room and stolen the backpack before committing the offence on Ms Schreiber’s premises.6 The offender has a shocking criminal history. She has displayed, over many years, a continuing attitude of disobedience to the law and thus is not entitled to any leniency at all which would come her way had she been a person of prior good character. She has committed offences in South Australia, Victoria, and now New South Wales. She is a person who, absent some circumstances I will soon mention, is deserving of a very lengthy period in custody to reflect her attitude towards the law and to reflect, of course, the objective gravity of her conduct on this occasion. She is a person who seems unable to prevent herself from committing further offences and so a sentence with a substantial component of personal deterrence is no doubt required.7 Ms Coultas-Roberts tendered to me a lengthy psycho/social assessment report, prepared on Ms Tregonning by a social worker in the employ of the Legal Aid Commissioner of New South Wales. I trust it will not be thought that I am treating the matter lightly by summarising it in very short compass. The summary I am about to give in no way does justice to the lengthy and distressing matters to be found in that report. Ms Tregonning is an aboriginal woman whose parents suffered as a result of being part of the stolen generation. She was sexually assaulted from the age of three or four years on a regular basis by an uncle. She suffered physical abuse as a child as well. Her mother was an alcoholic, and as she grew up she was unable to complete her schooling because of her mother’s alcoholism and the poverty that resulted. Since forming a relationship with a man, first at the age of sixteen, she has suffered significant domestic violence at the hands of a number of male partners. One of those partners died and she suffered that loss keenly. A sister of hers has died of cancer and she was unable to be at her bedside as she died; another matter of loss that she feels. Finally in this summary I mention that the offender was gang raped whilst in Sydney. It is not surprising that a person with that personal history would have problems with substance abuse. The criminal law often looks at moral culpability in terms of the choices that people make. Few people become addicted to drugs involuntarily. Most people become addicted to drugs through choice, but that is not to say that all of us have the same ability to make appropriate choices in our lives. The distressing personal history that I have summarised makes it clear that the ability of Ms Tregonning to choose not to indulge in substance abuse was significantly diminished. This is also a case where the principles in Fernando are of particular application. The problems that Ms Tregonning experienced in her life are problems which are felt more keenly in the aboriginal population than in wider society. One can understand how it would be that Ms Tregonning found herself in April 2006 under the influence of morphine and serapax and not in a position to think logically about what she was doing.8 Ms Tregonning is, and I do not wish to sound at all condescending when I say this, a remarkably well-spoken and clearly intelligent woman. It is truly a tragedy that a person of her obvious abilities and intelligence has been unable to rise out of the circumstances in which she found herself from an early age. Those circumstances are such that, as she reports to the social worker, every day for her is a challenge. Ms Tregonning has recently had a baby, Benjali, who was born in October 2006 and she has applied to be part of the mother and baby program. She must first, however, complete an anger management course. Benjali is not the only child that Ms Tregonning has. She has a number of children and she will no doubt feel keenly her separation from them whilst she is in custody.9 Ms Tregonning was on parole at the time of committing these offences. Given the regularity and length of her criminal history that is not surprising, but it is a matter of serious aggravation. The effects of these offences on Ms Schreiber, in particular, were significant. Ms Schreiber will no doubt feel that the sentence I am about to announce is a lenient one and in many respects she is right. However, one has to bear in mind the difficulties that the offender has faced from the age of three or four. Not minor difficulties at all, but difficulties that few of us fortunately have had to deal with. She is deserving of both punishment and sympathy. The old fashioned concept of mercy has particular application in the present case.10 For the offence of break, enter and steal, including the matters on the Form 1, Ms Tregonning is sentenced to imprisonment, with a non-parole period of eighteen months and a head sentence of three and a half years. As will be obvious, I have found special circumstances such that the non-parole period is in fact less than half of the head sentence. I have made that finding because a lengthy sentence is required, but so also is a lengthy period of supervision on parole. Once released from custody Ms Tregonning will be assisted by the Probation and Parole Service, but also be assisted by the knowledge that should she commit an offence her parole will be breached and she will find herself back inside with no one but herself to blame.11 For the offence of larceny I set a fixed term of imprisonment of twelve months, to date from 26 April 2006. That is a fixed term because it is entirely concurrent with the other sentence and there is no utility in setting a non-parole period.

    SENTENCE1 HIS HONOUR: George Jouni appears for sentence today on a number of offences. The first is an offence of larceny. When sentencing him for that offence he asks that I take into account two other offences, one of common assault, and one of possessing implements of housebreaking.2 The second offence is one of take and drive conveyance. The third offence is assault occasioning actual bodily harm, and there are two related matters of driving whilst suspended and negligent driving.3 All of these offences arose out of the events of 21 April 2006. On that day the offender was in the Grove Hotel at 236 Kingsgrove Road, Kingsgrove. Whether deliberately or accidentally, he found himself in an office area behind the bar. There was a sum of money there, in fact a significant sum of money, $27,430.4 He put that in his backpack and was walking back into the public area when he came across two employees of the hotel. He told them that he was looking for the toilet, so one of the employees directed him in that direction. But instead of going that way, the offender headed out the door.5 One of the employees, this was a Mr Shepherd, pursued him. As he did so, the offender said, “Do you want me to pop you?” This is the common assault on the form 1. Mr Shepherd paused and considered his position, but decided to continue pursuing the offender.6 At about this time a Mr Gregory Passos was driving past. He was the person who became the victim of the offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, and the taking of his car was the subject of the offence of taking and driving a conveyance.7 Mr Passos saw that Mr Shepherd, whom he recognised, was chasing the offender, so he stopped his car ahead of them. The offender ran to the passenger side of Mr Passos’s car and tried to get in. It was locked, so he went around to the other side, the driver’s side and brushed past Mr Passos who had already got out of the car. Mr Passos tried to stop the offender, but was unsuccessful. The offender succeeded in getting into the car and driving away.8 Mr Passos, in order to prevent his car being stolen, naturally and justifiably, although riskily, dived through the open driver’s window and grabbed the offender’s head. The offender told him to let go and said that he would give him thousands of dollars if he let him go. Mr Passos demanded that the offender stop the vehicle. Mr Jouni, the offender, did not do so. Instead he drove in a manner which significantly risked Mr Passos’s safety. He swerved across the road in an attempt to loosen Mr Passos’s hold of him. Mr Passos’s legs were hanging outside the car.9 Quite justifiably, in order to prevent himself being injured by the offender’s dangerous conduct, he struck the offender with his elbow in an attempt to get him to stop the car. He managed to turn the ignition off and the vehicle slowed down. The offender kicked out at him to get out of his hold, but Mr Passos managed to open the driver’s door of the car with his left hand, and dragged the offender from the vehicle. He was then restrained until police arrived.10 Mr Passos in his statement that was tendered before me said that he believed that the car driven by the offender was travelling at about eighty kilometres an hour. That may be a slight exaggeration, but it certainly would have felt like that to Mr Passos, hanging as he was onto the offender whilst he was partially in and partially out of the car.11 During the struggle the offender apparently bit Mr Passos, because Mr Passos suffered two bite marks to his right elbow. Or, it may be, that they occurred when Mr Passos was attempting to dissuade the offender from continuing to drive whilst he was partially in and partially out of the car.12 Police eventually arrived and discovered the stolen money in the backpack. It was thus recovered. They also found items that the offender admitted today were housebreaking implements. That is the second of the offences on the form 1.13 The offender’s licence was suspended for fine default at the time he drove Mr Passos’s vehicle, and so his driving whilst suspended, and in the manner he did, form the basis of the related matters for which he is also to be sentenced today.14 The offender has been in custody since he was arrested on the day of the offence.15 The offender has, or had, a significant problem with drugs and gambling. He says that that is what motivated him to commit these offences. He stole the money because he needed money for drugs and gambling. And he committed all the other offences in an attempt to avoid being caught.16 It is noteworthy that these offences were all committed whilst the offender was on two forms of conditional liberty. He was on a section 9 bond, and on bail for a number of offences at the time that he committed these offences.17 It is instructive to look at the offender’s criminal history. As Mr Roth accurately points out this is not a case where the offender has a lengthy and regular criminal history. If I ignore the driving matters for the moment, what appears is that the offender committed offences in the late 90s, but then there was nothing until 2005. The explanation for the offender commencing to commit these offences in 2005 seems to be related to his growing problems with drugs.18 The offender apparently has used drugs for a number of years, but it was not until he commenced a relationship with a heavy drug user, and suffered an assault in which his jaw was broken, that the offender’s drug use escalated to the extent that it became a significant problem for him.19 In the past the offender has been a productive member of society. He is a panel beater, and has successfully conducted a panel beating business in the past. All of that ended, of course, when the offender began taking drugs.20 It has to be said that the offender’s traffic history is something which no-one would envy. The offender explains that to various people as saying that he needed to transport cars as part of his panel beating business and could not afford trade plates. I find that an explanation which is most unconvincing, given the type and nature of the offender’s traffic history. Certainly some of them appear to be related to his work as a panel beater, such as driving an uninsured motor vehicle, or driving with number plates calculated to deceive, but many of the others are simply the offender failing to recognise that he needs to comply with the obligations of a road user.21 The offender was born in Australia to parents of Lebanese origin. He has the support of his family, despite his present predicament. They will welcome him back into the family home on one condition, and that is the quite understandable condition that the offender will relinquish his relationship with the previous partner, the woman whom I mentioned had a significant drug problem.22 These were all serious offences. The offender was prepared to profit through his illegal conduct to a significant extent, preferring to steal rather than to either obtain money in a lawful way, or perhaps more obviously, to do something about his addictions to both drugs and gambling.23 Both the crown and Mr Roth have referred me to parts of the decision in R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346. One thing that Henry speaks about is the importance of personal choice. For that reason Wood CJ at CL talks about the situation where a person’s addiction to drugs does not come about of their own choosing. This is not, however, such a case.24 True it is that the offender was in a relationship with a woman who used drugs, and suffered from an assault upon him. But his decision to commence using various types of drugs, and to then escalate the level of use, was always the offender’s. It may be that the offender was in fact under the influence of drugs at the time he committed these offences, but given his motivation, it is unlikely that the offender would have acted in any different way had he not recently used drugs.25 The offender recognised his guilt from an early opportunity and pleaded guilty. I will discount the sentence I would otherwise have imposed therefore by twenty-five per cent to reflect the utilitarian value of the plea.26 The offender has expressed remorse to a number of people, although, it has to be noted, he did not give evidence to that effect in court today. Nevertheless, the crown did not object to material being put before me by way of affidavit. This is a most unusual way of putting material before a judge. The offender was not cross-examined about any aspect of the material put forward by way of mitigation in the affidavit. But it could not be said that that information carries the same impact as if the offender had himself entered the witness box and used his own words to describe how he felt about these matters.27 It is clear that the material in the affidavit was prepared by a lawyer. Although the offender signed the affidavit. I am reading lawyer’s words rather than what the offender would have said if he was in the witness box himself. Despite those matters, I will accept that the offender is remorseful for what he has done.28 He is particularly concerned about the impact of his wrongdoing on his family, and perhaps to a lesser extent concerned with the fact that he risked the life of Mr Passos, the man whose car he was in the process of stealing.29 I am unable to determine whether this was an offence which was planned or not. I am not satisfied that it is an aggravating feature that the offence was planned, but nor am I satisfied that it is a mitigating feature that it was not. If the offender did find himself away from the public areas of the pub he was remarkably lucky in that he managed to chance upon an office area with a large sum of money in it.30 I am unable to find that the offender has good prospects of rehabilitation. The crown referred me to material in the Pre-Sentence Report which indicated that the offender has thus far, whilst in the community, done little to address his drug addiction. In circumstances such as these where the offender’s wrongdoing is closely related to his addiction to drugs, much will depend on his attitude once he is released from custody. As matters presently stand I cannot say that he has good prospects of rehabilitation and is unlikely to re-offend.31 I have found special circumstances. The offender has learning difficulties, a low IQ, and this will be his first time in custody, but the effective non-parole period I will shortly announce is, I consider, the lowest which properly reflects the objective gravity of the offender’s conduct. I will impose individual sentences for the various offences, and it will be made clear that I have allowed some level of accumulation and some level of concurrence in order, as a matter of totality to, reflect the overall appropriate sentence in view of the objective and subjective circumstances.32 For the offence of larceny, taking into account the matters on the form 1, the offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of one year to commence on 21 April 2006, and a head sentence of two years.33 For the offender of taking and driving a conveyance, the offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of one year to commence on 21 October 2006 and to expire on 20 October 2007. I set a head sentence of two years for that offence as well.34 For the offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm the offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of one year to commence on 21 April 2007. The non-parole period will expire on 20 April 2008 on which day the offender is to be released to parole. I set a head sentence for that matter of three years.35 For the offence of driving whilst suspended, I set a fixed term of imprisonment of six months to date from 21 April 2006, and he is disqualified from driving for twelve months from 21 April 2006.36 For the offence of negligent driving, he is disqualified from driving for two years from 21 April 2007.

    CRIMINAL PROCEDURE – duplicity – lack of particularityENVIRONMENT PROTECTION – pollutant likely to fall and descend into protected waters 
     
     FACTS 
    The appellant was convicted on a charge that it indirectly polluted waters in a adjoining lagoon contrary to s 120(1) of the Protection of the Environment Operations Act 1997. The charge arose out of the storage of an industrial by-product in a tank from which it was “likely to” fall and descend into the lagoon. On appeal it was submitted that the summons upon which the appellant was convicted was defective as it lacked particularity or was duplicitous. No objection to the form of the summons was raised at the trial. HELD: by majority (1) Although the summons did not specify the act or omission by which the defendant was alleged to have committed the offence it did state the legal elements of the charge and the defect was cured by s 16(2): Taylor v EPA  (2000) 50 NSWLR 48, 56; Stanton v Abernathy (1990) 19 NSWLR 656; (2) There was no miscarriage of justice because of the latent duplicity or lack of particularity; (3) There was sufficient evidence of the elements within the charge as particularised to ground the conviction; (4) The appeal against conviction should be dismissed with costs.

     PACE FARM EGG PRODUCTS PTY LTD v NEWCASTLE CITY COUNCIL 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 HANDLEY JA: This is an appeal by the defendant from its conviction by the Land and Environment Court (Pain J) of an offence contrary to s 120(1) of the Protection of the Environment Operations Act 1997 (the Act) that “it polluted waters at Warabrook Wetland Reserve” on or about 3 October 2003. The summons identified the place of the offence, the pollutant, and the waters. It identified the manner in which the pollution occurred as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “The pollutant was in a position where it was likely to and did fall, descend and be washed into the waters, into a drain designed to receive or pass rainwater, floodwater or non-polluted waters. 
         
         
        The pollutant was introduced into the said waters at the said place by passing through the pipes and pits within the defendant’s land and through the public stormwater drainage pipe and pit system to discharge into the Warabrook Lagoon (Upper Pond) on the Warabrook Wetland Reserve.” 
        
       
      
    2 The defendant pleaded not guilty and the trial proceeded without any objection to the form of the summons from experienced senior counsel appearing for the defendant. Following conviction and sentence the defendant appealed without taking any objection to the form of the summons. 
     
      
    3 The Dictionary of the Act contains a lengthy definition of “water pollution” or “pollution of waters” but no definition of the corresponding verb which appears in the section creating the offence. This does not matter because s 7 of the Interpretation Act 1987 provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “If an Act … defines a word or expression, other parts of speech and grammatical forms of the word or expression have corresponding meanings.” 
        
       
      
    4 The definition covers both direct and indirect pollution. The case involved allegations of indirect pollution defined in sub-paras (d) and (e) of the definition. The relevant sub-paragraph is (d) which provides, with its context: 
     
      
       
        
        “water pollution or pollution of waters means: 
         
         
        … 
         
         
        and, without affecting the generality of the foregoing, includes:  
         
        
        
        (d) placing any matter … in a position where:  
         
         
          
          (i) it falls, descends, is washed, is blown or percolates, or 
           
          (ii) it is likely to fall, descend, be washed, be blown or percolate, 
          
         
         
          
          into any waters … or into any drain, channel or gutter used or designed to receive or pass rainwater … or any water that is not polluted … 
          
         
         
        … 
         
         
        if the matter would, had it been placed in any waters, have polluted or have been likely to pollute those waters.” 
        
       
      
    5 Liquid egg waste produced in the appellant’s factory was stored in an external tank (the tank) next to its factory building adjacent to the concrete apron of the loading bay. It had a capacity of 6,830 litres. At 5.45am on Friday, 3 October 2003 one of the appellant’s employees noticed liquid egg waste “all over” the concrete apron of the loading bay which had leaked from the tank (708). Mr Fitzpatrick said there was “a huge mess … a lot of liquid flowing around the area” (97). The hole in the tank from which the waste was leaking was plugged, and salt bags were placed above the stormwater pit SW1 nearby (3/40) to stop egg waste running into it. Traces of egg waste were later detected at SW2 and SW4 but not at SW5 or SW6. SW3 is on a branch drainage line which feeds into the main line and is not relevant. The stormwater drainage from the appellant’s property leads through SW6 into the public system and to Warabrook Lagoon.  
     
      
    6 About 10.00am Mr King, the appellant’s maintenance coordinator, decided that he would flush approximately 1500 litres of water through the appellant’s drainage system from SW1 to SW6 to remove any egg waste there. Mr Fitzpatrick, a tanker driver from Valley Disposals, was present having just pumped out the remaining egg waste from the tank. Mr King arranged for him to vacuum up the water that would come through the drainage line at SW6. Mr Fitzpatrick did this but while packing up his truck 20 litres of diluted egg waste escaped from the hose onto the surrounding grass and into SW6. He said he vacuumed up the spill on the grass and in SW6 (the Fitzpatrick incident). 
     
      
    7 Between 11.00 and 11.15 a resident saw a white milky substance about 10 metres long in Warabrook Lagoon and reported the matter to the Council. 
     
      
    8 The Judge was not persuaded that egg waste from the appellant’s factory reached the Lagoon either from the initial leakage, or from the Fitzpatrick incident. The Judge noted: para [86] “that it was not part of the Prosecutor’s case that there was an escape of egg waste into SW6 due to Mr Fitzpatrick’s actions, rather the Prosecutor’s efforts were directed to establishing that it did not”. However she was satisfied that the appellant had placed egg waste into the tank “where it was likely to fall or descend into” the waters of the Lagoon through the stormwater drainage systems and on this basis she convicted. 
     
      
    9 I have had the benefit of reading the reasons for judgment of Hulme J who considers that the charge was defective because it was either duplicitous or because the appellant was convicted of an offence other than that charged in the summons. 
     
      
    10 Section 43 of the Land and Environment Court Act 1979 (the Court Act), now repealed, provided: 
     
      
       
        
        “No objection shall be taken or allowed to any application referred to in … section 41 … by reason of any alleged defect in it in substance or in form or by reason of any variance between it and the evidence adduced at the proceedings for the offence charged in the application …” 
        
       
      
    11 Section 44 entitled the accused to an adjournment where there was a significant variance between the application and the evidence. These provisions were based on s 65 of the Justices Act 1902, later s 30, derived from Lord Jervis’s Act 1848: Ex parte Lovell re Buckley (1938) 38 SR (NSW) 153, 167-8, 170. Sections 43 and 44, along with the rest of Div 5 of Pt 4 of the Court Act were repealed by Act No 121 of 2001 with effect from 7 July 2003.  
     
      
    12 The power formerly conferred by s 43 is now conferred by the Criminal Procedure Act 1986: s 15(1). Section 16(2) applies to orders to appear under s 246(1) which initiate summary proceedings in the Court. These are indictments within the definition in s 15(2). Section 16(2) provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “(2) No objection may be taken, or allowed, to any indictment by which criminal proceedings … in a Local Court or for any other offence that is to be dealt with summarily are commenced … on the grounds of:  
         
          
          (a) any alleged defect in it in substance or in form, or 
           
          (b) any variance between it and the evidence adduced at the proceedings for the offence charged in the indictment …” 
          
         
        
       
      
    13 The power formally conferred by s 44 of the Court Act is now conferred by s 40(4) of the Procedure Act which provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “… a court may, at the request of an accused person, adjourn criminal proceedings if it appears to the court that a variance between any process … by which the proceedings were commenced and the evidence adduced in respect of the offence charged in that process … is such that the accused person has been misled by the variance.” 
        
       
      
    14 In Brownlie v SPCC (1992) 27 NSWLR 78, 88 Gleeson CJ said of the former ss 43 and 44 in the Court Act and equivalent provisions that they “are of no assistance where the offence alleged is not one known to the law”. Section 145A(1) of the Justices Act 1902, now repealed, provided: 
     
      
       
        
        “The description of any offence in the words of the Act … creating the offence, or in similar words, shall be sufficient in law.” 
        
       
      
    15 It adopted s 39 of the Summary Jurisdiction Act 1879 (42 & 43 Vic c 49). Charges in this form were sometimes permissible at common law: R v Chandler (1700) 1 Ld Raym 581 [91 ER 1288, 1289]; Fletcher v Calthrop (1845) 6 QB 880, 887 [115 ER 332, 335]; Ex parte Ryan re Johnson (1943) 44 SR 12, 16 per Jordan CJ. The equivalent provision is now in s 11 of the Procedure Act. 
     
      
    16 In Stanton v Abernathy (1990) 19 NSWLR 656, 666 Gleeson CJ said that s 145A(1): 
     
      
       
        
        “… does not do away with the common law requirement that an information must identify the essential factual ingredients of the actual offence alleged to have been committed [citations omitted]. The difficulty is that the courts have never managed to produce a technical verbal formula of precise application which constitutes an easy guide … as to whether the common law rule has been infringed to such an extent that s 145A, operating alone, would be insufficient to save the information.” 
        
       
      
    17 In Taylor v EPA (2000) 50 NSWLR 48, 56 Sperling J said: 
     
      
       
        
        “To be valid, an information must identify the essential factual ingredients of the offence charged [citations omitted]. A distinction has been drawn between ‘essential factual ingredients’ (particulars required for the validity of an information) and particulars required merely to ensure that the defendant is able to prepare his or her defence [citations omitted]. The latter are not essential particulars … The authorities provide no comprehensive formula for what constitute essential particulars. However, in  
        Johnson v Miller  
        [(1937) 59 CLR 467] various requirements were identified. These include ‘the time, place and manner of the defendant's acts or omissions’ … The summons in the present case does not specify the essential ingredients of the alleged offence. It specifies the legal elements of the alleged offence, but it does not specify the acts or omissions by which the appellant is alleged to have [committed the offence].” 
        
       
      
    18 This passage was approved in McConnell Dowell Constructors (Aust) Pty Ltd v EPA (2000) 50 NSWLR 127, 134 (McConnell). Having considered the terms of the summons charging pollution of waters contrary to s 16(1) of the Clean Waters Act Spigelman CJ said: 
     
      
       
        
        “In my opinion, some reference to the conduct … said to constitute the act of polluting was required in the summons and in the s 41 order. Section 16 has been called a ‘result offence’, in the sense that the consequence, that is, the pollution, is an essential ingredient of the offence … However as Hunt CJ at CL said in  
        EPA v Bathurst CC 
         (1995) 89 LGERA 79, 82 … ‘the prosecution is required to prove both the conduct of the defendant in placing the material in the waters and the pollution of the waters as a consequence of the defendant having done so’. 
         
         
        I agree. Both the polluting and the pollution are essential ingredients of the offence under s 16. The charge in this case referred only to the pollution."" 
        
       
      
    19 As Sperling J said in Taylor v EPA (above) at 57: 
     
      
       
        
        “A distinction is drawn between informations which fail to specify the legal elements of the offence and those where essential factual particulars have not been given. Where an information fails to specify the essential legal elements of the offence, the information is not saved by a Lord Jervis provision [citations omitted]. Where, however, the legal elements of the offence are specified and the defect lies only in a failure to specify essential factual particulars – such as the time, place, or the manner of the offence – a Lord Jervis provision will operate [citations omitted]. The summons in the present case falls within the second category of defective informations. It is saved by s 43.” 
        
       
      
    20 In McConnell (above) this Court held that the summons failed to disclose essential elements of the offence, namely the conduct of the defendant alleged to constitute polluting, but the stated case did not permit the Court to consider s 43 of the Court Act (134-5).  
     
      
    21 The summons by which the respondent initiated this prosecution, and the order of the Court under s 246(1) of the Procedure Act required the appellant to answer a charge under s 120(1) that it “polluted waters at Warabrook Wetland Reserve”. It alleged the essential legal elements of the offence: McConnell (No 2) (2002) 54 NSWLR 39, 42-3.  
     
      
    22 It has not been suggested that the summons did not adequately particularise the place of the offence, the pollutant, or the waters. However the particulars of the manner in which the pollution occurred were expressed in the passive voice: 
     
      
       
        
        “The pollutant was in a position where it was likely to and did fall, descend and be washed into the waters, into a drain designed to receive or pass rainwater, floodwater or non-polluted waters.” 
        
       
      
    23 The act of the appellant alleged as the foundation of the charge was left to inference. The summons and order were therefore defective but since the legal elements of the offence were properly stated s 16(2) of the Procedure Act was capable of curing the defect. 
     
      
    24 It will be necessary in due course to consider how s 16(2) applied, but it will be convenient to first consider the question of duplicity. 
     
      
    25 The definition of water pollution etc: para [4] covers a number of different factual situations. These included “placing any matter … in a position where [(d)(ii)] it is likely to fall [or] descend … into any waters” and “where [(d)(i)] it falls [or] descends … into any waters”. 
     
      
    26 This Court has considered whether a definition in this form in earlier legislation created one or more than one offence. In Brownlie v SPCC (1992) 27 NSWLR 78 the Court was concerned with s 16 of the Clean Waters Act. Sub-section (2)(a)(i) and (ii) contained language identical to sub-paras (i) and (ii) of para (d) of the definition of water pollution etc in the Act. At 82 Gleeson CJ said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Some mention should also be made of the scheme of s 16(2). That provision does not itself create an offence. It is in the nature of a definition provision. The facts of the case, as found by Cripps J, fell within both subcll (i) and (ii) of s 16(2)(a). On the basis of his Honour's findings, the appellant engaged in conduct within s 16(2)(a)(ii) when he sprayed his land, and then, following the rain, the case also fell within s 16(2)(a)(i). There must be many cases in which a person places matter in a position such that it is likely to be washed into waters and then, subsequently, the matter is actually washed into those waters. That does not necessarily mean that the person will have committed two contraventions of s 16(1). Rather, it may mean simply that the prosecution will be able to rely on additional evidence. As a practical matter, proof that something is washed into waters will often assist a conclusion that it was originally placed in a position where it was likely to wash into those waters … It was not argued that the charge under s 16(1) was bad for duplicity.” 
        
       
      
    27 The question was considered in CSR Ltd v EPA (2000) 110 LGERA 334 in relation to a charge under s 6(1) of the Environmental Offences and Penalties Act 1989 which relevantly provided that “if a person, without lawful authority, wilfully or negligently caused any substance to leak, spill or otherwise escape … in a manner which harmed or was likely to harm the environment” the person was guilty of an offence.  
     
      
    28 The summons in that case charged the defendant that, without lawful authority, it negligently caused a substance to leak in a manner which harmed the environment (335). The EPA sought leave to amend so that the summons would read “in that it did … negligently cause a substance to leak in a manner which harmed or was likely to harm the environment” (338).  
     
      
    29 Smart AJ said (339): 
     
      
       
        
        “CSR submitted that the effect of the amendment is to produce a summons … which is bad for duplicity as it would charge two offences. CSR contended that the language of s 6(1) compels the conclusion that the prohibited conduct is that of negligently causing a substance to leak in a particular manner, one being that which harms the environment and the other that which is likely to harm the environment and that separate offences were thereby created. In amplification, CSR submitted that the former offence was complete upon harm being caused whereas the latter was complete upon the substance leaking in a particular manner. Consequently, two different limitation periods should be applicable … I disagree that the amended summons charges two offences. I agree with the judge that there was one offence and that it penalised one act (negligently causing a substance to leak) which possesses one or both of two forbidden characteristics. I would follow this statement of principle by Bray CJ in  
        Romeyko v Samuels  
        (1972) 2 SASR 529, 552: 
         
         
          
          ‘The [true] distinction, broadly speaking ... is between a statute which penalises one or more acts in which case two or more offences are created and a statute which penalises one act if it possesses one or more forbidden characteristics. In the latter case there is only one offence whether the act under consideration in fact possesses one or several such characteristics ... ‘ 
          
         
         
        In  
        Bowling v General Motors-Holdens Pty Ltd  
        (1975) 8 ALR 197, 218 Woodward J said:  
         
         
          
          ‘Provided only a single act is charged, alternative or cumulative allegations as to the circumstances making it unlawful will not render it bad for uncertainty or duplicity.’ 
          
         
         
        … the essential subject matter remains, namely, causing a substance to leak.” 
        
       
      
    30 In Stanton v Abernathy (above) Gleeson CJ considered what was then s 30 of the Justices Act and is now s 16(2) of the Procedure Act and said (667): 
     
      
       
        
        “… the legislation operates, not to deem defective applications to be sufficient, but to avoid the consequences of defects in applications. It was intended to do away with technical objections in proceedings before magistrates. … in the case of want of particularity in an information, the requirements of natural justice may nevertheless make it necessary for the magistrate to order further particulars. In relation to the matter of duplicity, the relevant authorities are not easy to reconcile. There is a line of cases [citations omitted] which hold that duplicity is a defect in substance of a kind that falls squarely within the language of s 30 and corresponding provisions elsewhere, and that a magistrate may not dismiss an information simply on the ground of duplicity.” 
        
       
      
    31 There was another line of authority dealing with the effect of duplicity but he preferred the view expressed above. In Stanton’s case the information did not identify the part of the appellant’s evidence which was alleged to be false, and although the information charged only one offence it appeared from particulars that there was latent duplicity. Gleeson CJ concluded (671): 
     
      
       
        
        “The authorities do not in my view justify a conclusion that the information is incurably defective, or not such as to found jurisdiction in the magistrate. However, the proper course now to be pursued, it being apparent that the prosecutor is alleging more than one offence, is for the prosecution to be required both to give further and better particulars … and either elect to charge the appellant with making one false statement to the exclusion of any others, or alternatively to frame and propound additional charges, laying one charge in respect of each alleged false statement. If the prosecution declines to adopt either of those courses, then the information should be dismissed.” 
        
       
      
    32 In the present case the summons and order were not duplicitous on their face and the only defect was the failure to identify the act of the appellant which placed the pollutant in a position where it was likely to and did fall etc. 
     
      
    33 Section 16(2) of the Procedure Act or its equivalent preserves a summons under s 246(1) of that Act from the consequences that would otherwise flow from a failure to specify essential particulars of the offence: Stanton v Abernathy (above) at 667; Taylor v EPA (above) at 57; McConnell (No 2) (above) at 41-2. 
     
      
    34 Since the summons did not particularise “the particular act, matter or thing alleged as the foundation of the charge”: Johnson v Miller (1937) 59 CLR at 489, the appellant was entitled to further and better particulars: para [31]. However it neither challenged the validity of the summons nor sought such particulars. 
     
      
    35 There was a potential latent duplicity in the charge. Although evidence for the Council focussed on the appellant’s acts in placing egg waste in the tank it also led evidence without objection about the Fitzpatrick incident: paras [6] and [8]. An occupier of premises at or from which any pollution occurs is responsible for that pollution including any caused by a subcontractor: Act s 257. 
     
      
    36 However as the Judge said: para [8] “it was not part of the Prosecutor’s case that there was an escape of egg waste into SW6 due to Mr Fitzpatrick’s actions”.  
     
      
    37 If the appellant had objected to the form of the summons the Council would have been required to give particulars of the act or acts of the appellant relied on to establish its criminal responsibility. Its particulars would have indicated that it did not rely on the Fitzpatrick incident, and that there was no duplicity.  
     
      
    38 The course of the trial removed any uncertainty due to the lack of particulars. The Council only relied on the placement of egg waste in the tank to prove that it was likely to and had fallen or descended into the Lagoon. The authorities in this Court establish that a charge in this form is not duplicitous. Thus the appellant was only convicted of the one offence identified in the Judge’s reasons based on the “likely” limb of the charge: para [1]. The conviction was not duplicitous. 
     
      
    39 The former requirement in s 57 of the Justices Act that an information be for only one offence was re-enacted as ss 51 and 176 of the Procedure Act by the Criminal Procedure Amendment (Justices and Local Courts) Act (No 119 of 2001) but these sections were repealed by Act No 99 of 2002 (Sch 1 cl 1.2[2]). The provisions of the Procedure Act which replaced provisions in the Court Act do not include any requirement that a summons and order to appear be for a single offence. There was and is no prohibition against multiple charges in a Class 5 case in the Court, but the common law rule that a count in an indictment must be for a single offence still applies. 
     
      
    40 Section 29(1) of the Procedure Act, which has applied to the Court since 2003, enables it to hear and determine proceedings relating to two or more offences where both parties consent or the offences arise out of the same set of circumstances. The Court must not hear charges together if it considers that the matters should be heard separately in the interests of justice (sub-s (3)). 
     
      
    41 Section 57 of the Justices Act and equivalent provisions were held to limit the jurisdiction of a magistrate’s court. Since there was no jurisdiction to hear a prosecution for a charge that was duplicitous: Stanton v Abernathy para [31], a conviction on such a charge was bad: Edwards v Jones [1947] KB 659, 661-2; Mallon v Allon [1964] 1 QB 385, 393; Hargreaves v Alderson [1964] 2 QB 159, 165; compare Ex parte Graham re Dowling (1968) 88 WN Pt 1 (NSW) 270 CA. This is not, and has never been, the law in relation to summary proceedings in Class 5 of the Court’s jurisdiction. 
     
      
    42 The common law rule against duplicity in criminal pleading does not have this effect. The question was considered in S v The Queen (1989) 168 CLR 266 and Walsh v Tattersall (1996) 188 CLR 77, the former in relation to a trial on an indictment, the latter in relation to summary proceedings.  
     
      
    43 In S v The Queen (above) the accused was charged with three counts of incest each within a one year period on dates unknown without those dates being identified in any way. Evidence of several acts of intercourse within each of these years was led from the victim without the prosecution having to elect. The Court held that there had been a miscarriage of justice and a new trial was ordered. Dawson J said at 277: 
     
      
       
        
        “There have been cases in which it has been held that latent ambiguity or even duplicity in an indictment does not necessarily lead to a substantial miscarriage of justice [citations omitted]. But in those cases either no embarrassment or prejudice was alleged or no point was taken at the trial. In any event, the earlier cases must be read subject to the decision of this Court in  
        Johnson v Miller  
        in which it was held that a complaint was rightly dismissed because of the failure of the prosecution to cure a latent ambiguity by identifying the one transaction out of a number upon which it relied … At all events, where there is real ambiguity and the point is taken, as it was in this case, failure to correct the ambiguity means that the accused has not had a proper trial and there is, for that reason, a substantial miscarriage of justice.” 
        
       
      
    44 Gaudron and McHugh JJ said at 286-7: 
     
      
       
        
        “Prejudice is the focus of consideration when the question is whether some order should be made as to the conduct of the trial to avoid difficulties which may be occasioned by reason of uncertainty as to what precisely is charged. Ordinarily, those difficulties will be averted by ordering particulars, by amending the indictment, or by putting the prosecution to its election and appropriately confining the evidence to the offences charged … However, when a trial proceeds without an order averting those difficulties, the question is whether there has been a blemish on the trial amounting to a substantial miscarriage of justice.” 
        
       
      
    45 Walsh v Tattersall (above) concerned a summary trial. The only relevant judgment for present purposes is that of Kirby J who said at 110, 111, 112-13: 
     
      
       
        
        “If the latent defect, once exposed, suggests a risk that the accused might not have a fair trial on the charges as pleaded, the court should require correction … I cannot agree to any reduction in the strict approach to resolving questions of duplicity in the pleading of criminal charges … The rule of strictness is … desirable for the fair trial of the accused … The appellant asked for an order dismissing the complaint. However, that is not the remedy which the law now provides for a case of established duplicity.” 
        
       
      
    46 The Court quashed the duplicitous count and the conviction on it leaving the informant free to replead and continue the prosecution.  
     
      
    47 A conviction by a jury on a duplicitous count will often be bad because a jury does not give reasons and the conviction will be ambiguous. A conviction by a judge following a summary prosecution will generally not be ambiguous because the judge will have given reasons. If the reasons show that the conviction on the duplicitous count was for a single offence I see no reason why the Court should shut its eyes to reality and treat the conviction as duplicitous. 
     
      
    48 If the duplicity and lack of particularity in one or more charges occasioned a miscarriage of justice because, for example, the defendant was taken by surprise, put in a position of embarrassment or disadvantage, or the conviction is ambiguous the Court must interfere. If there has been no miscarriage of justice then, given the well established operation of s 16(2) and the power conferred by s 29 of the Procedure Act there is no reason for this Court to treat the trial as a nullity, or the conviction as automatically bad.  
     
      
    49 In this case there has been no miscarriage of justice because of duplicity or lack of particularity. The challenge to the conviction on these grounds should be dismissed. 
     
      
    50 Hulme J considers that the conviction is bad because the appellant was convicted of an offence different from that charged in the particulars. I am unable to accept this view. The relevant particulars were para [1]:  
     
      
       
        
        “The pollutant was in a position where it was likely to and did fall … into the waters, into a drain designed to receive … rainwater …”.  
        
       
      
    51 The particulars also alleged that the pollutant was introduced into the “said waters” by passing through the pipes and pits within the defendant’s land to the public system from where it discharged into Warabrook Lagoon. 
     
      
    52 Although the charge was that pollutant from the defendant’s property “was likely to and did fall” into the waters of the Lagoon the particulars included an allegation that the pollutant was in a position where it was “likely to fall” into those waters and “into a drain designed to receive or pass rainwater”. 
     
      
    53 Evidence of these matters was within the charge as particularised and the failure of the Council to prove the whole of its case did not require the Court to ignore the evidence that established an offence within the particulars. The difference is a variance within ss 16(2)(b) and 40(4) of the Procedure Act which does not prevent the Court acting on evidence, within the particulars, that established the offence charged. 
     
      
       
      
    Meaning of likely in the definition 
     
      
    54 Mr Hale SC for the appellant submitted that in the definition of water pollution etc in the Dictionary “likely” meant more probably than not while Mr Craig for the respondent supported the construction adopted by the Judge that it meant “a real or not remote chance or possibility regardless of whether it is less or more than a fifty per cent chance”. This was the construction of the predecessor provision in s 16(2) of the 1970 Act that was adopted by Smart J in Mathews v Goulburn Wool Processors Pty Ltd (unreported 6/11/1986) at pp 12-15. The reasoning of Smart J on this question was not affected by the decision of this Court which reversed his decision on another point: (1987) 10 NSWLR 419. The Land and Environment Court has consistently followed this construction of s 16(2) and cognate legislation: SPCC v Blayney Abattoirs Pty Ltd (1991) 72 LGERA 221, 224; NSW Sugar Milling Co-operative Ltd v SPCC (1991) 73 LGERA 86, 100; EPA v Anning [1998] NSWLEC 135. 
     
      
    55 Mr Hale submitted that there was a conceptual difficulty in establishing beyond reasonable doubt that there was a real and not remote chance or possibility of something occurring if the chance was less than 50 per cent. However the difficulty is the same if likely means more probable than not. In any event likely has been given this meaning in a statutory definition of murder. In Boughey v The Queen (1986) 161 CLR 10 the Court considered the meaning of “likely” in s 156(2) of the Criminal Code (Tas) which defined culpable homicide as including homicide caused by an act “which is commonly known to be likely to cause death or bodily harm” and in s 157(1) which defined murder as culpable homicide which the offender knew to be likely to cause death. Mason, Wilson and Deane JJ said (21-2): 
     
      
       
        
        “… in our view, the word ‘likely’ is used in both [sections] with what we apprehend to be its ordinary meaning, namely, to convey the notion of a substantial – a ‘real and not remote’ – chance regardless of whether it is less or more than 50 per cent … To bury the word ‘likely’ in s 157(1) … beneath the gloss of ‘more likely than not’ and the explanation of ‘a more than 50 per cent’ or an ‘odds on’ chance would be to … to attribute to the word ‘likely’ a requirement of a specific degree of mathematical probability which the word does not convey either as a matter of ordinary language or in its context in s 157(1) of the Code.” 
        
       
      
    56 The reasoning of Smart J on this question has stood for 20 years and we were not referred to any judicial criticism of it. In 1997 Parliament adopted the same language in the definition of water pollution etc in the Act. Parliament has given a lot of attention in recent years to the protection of the environment and if those promoting the 1997 Act considered that the meaning of likely adopted in these cases was not appropriate, the new Act would have made it clear that a different meaning was intended. Where the language of a statute has received judicial interpretation and Parliament again employs the same language in a subsequent statute dealing with the same subject there is a presumption that Parliament intended that the language used by it in a subsequent statute should be given the meaning which has been judicially attributed to it in the meantime: Salvation Army (Victoria) Property Trust v Ferntree Gully Corporation (1952) 85 CLR 159, 174; The Queen v Reynhoudt (1962) 107 CLR 381, 395-6, 403, 406-8.  
     
      
    57 Smart J considered Tillmanns Butcheries Pty Ltd v Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union (1979) 42 FLR 331 and particularly the judgment of Deane J who held that likely may have this meaning in an appropriate context. In ASIC v Nomura International plc (1998) 89 FCR 301 Sackville J held that likely in s 998(1) of the Corporations Law meant more probable than not. He said (396): 
     
      
       
        
        “The form of the provisions considered in these cases was important to the outcome. For example, Deane J in  
        Tillmanns  
        at 347, thought it significant that s 45D(1) proscribed conduct that ‘would have or be likely to have’ a particular effect … If, in that context, ‘likely’ meant more probable than not, the words ‘be likely to have’ would have had no work to do. Section 998(1) is couched in different terms.” 
        
       
      
    58 This reasoning is not relevant in the present context and the decision does not require this Court to re-open the established construction of this definition.  
     
      
    The decision of Pain J on the facts 
     
      
    59 The Judge was not satisfied to the requisite standard that egg waste from the appellant’s factory reached Warabrook Lagoon. Mr Hale relied on this and other matters to challenge the Judge’s finding that on the day in question it was “likely to fall [or] descend … into the waters” of the Lagoon. Although egg waste had leaked from the black tank onto the concrete apron and into SW1, from where it had flowed to SW2, and SW4 prompt and effective action on the morning of 3 October prevented it getting any further. The egg waste at SW4 still had some distance to travel before it left the appellant’s property (3/40).  
     
      
    60 The fact that, on a particular occasion, the pollutant does not “fall [or] descend” into waters cannot exclude a finding that it was “likely” to do so because that would write the second limb out of the definition.  
     
      
    61 The tank stood in the open and on the day in question exhibited obvious signs of rust as the appellant’s maintenance co-ordinator acknowledged (2/323-4, 3/2-4). The appellant had no system for its inspection and maintenance (2/325). The egg waste leaked through a hole created by rust (3/427). When the tank was inspected by an expert on 4 August 2004 corrosion of varying severity was evident over a broad area on the external and internal surfaces where the paint system had been compromised. There were areas of extreme corrosion and metal wastage with the worst affected on the bottom (3/425-6). Two holes were identified at that time (3/437). The appearance on the day in question, with an appropriate adjustment, was some evidence of its condition on the day of the leakage 10 months earlier because of the retrospective presumption of continuance: Cloverdell Lumber Co Pty Ltd v Abbott (1924) 34 CLR 122, 137-8 per Isaacs J. 
     
      
    62 It is obvious that in the absence of any system of inspection and maintenance the rusting tank was likely to leak sooner or later and the fact that it sprang a leak sometime between 3pm on 2 October and 5.45am on 3 October demonstrated that it was likely to do so. Future events are admissible, not to prove a hindsight, but to confirm a foresight: Minister Administering the Crown Lands Act v Deerubbin Local Aboriginal Land Council (2001) 50 NSWLR 665, 677 per Spigelman CJ quoting a statement by Hope JA. 
     
      
    63 Although the tank was normally emptied every Friday, this did not always happen. Mr Fitzpatrick said that he emptied the tank when asked by the appellant to do so (2/97, 121). The tank could have begun to leak over a weekend without the leak being detected until the following Monday morning, or even Tuesday if there was a long weekend such as that which fell on 4-6 October 2003.  
     
      
    64 Once the tank began to leak the egg waste would flow by gravity across the concrete apron and into SW1 and eventually, if there was enough waste in the tank, and nothing was done, it would flow into the Lagoon. There were voids or sumps in the drainage pits which would have to be full before the waste could move further down the drainage line and some of the waste would be needed to wet the surface of the pipes and would not move further.  
     
      
    65 There was also evidence that there were voids under the concrete apron. Egg waste flowing across the apron would leak into these through the gaps between the slabs and this would delay and reduce the movement of the waste to SW1.  
     
      
    66 The dryness or otherwise of the pits and pipes in the drainage line and of the voids under the concrete apron would be affected by rain. If enough rain had fallen shortly before the tank sprang a leak the pits might be full, the pipes might be wet, and the voids under the apron might also be more or less full. If this was the position the waste would flow more quickly through the system (386). Moreover if it rained heavily during the leakage the runoff would carry the egg waste to the Lagoon within half an hour. A fluorescein test with running water on 17 December 2003 carried the dye from SW1 to the gross pollution traps on the edge of the Lagoon in 24 minutes: judgment para [24]. 
     
      
    67 Rainfall of 6.8mm and 1.4mm was recorded at Newcastle University during the 24 hours to 9am on 2 and 3 October respectively. The University was only about 1.5 kilometres from the appellant’s property although the location of the rain gauge was not established. The falls on 2 October would have generated runoff from the impervious areas on the site, and that on 3 October may have done so (3/576). Dr Joliffe said that with this rainfall it was highly improbable that the pits were completely dry during the night of 2-3 October, and it was quite possible that they were full of water (259). 
     
      
    68 As the Judge found there was no bund or other physical barrier which would prevent egg waste which leaked from the tank flowing under gravity across the concrete apron to SW1 and then eventually to the Lagoon. 
     
      
    69 The primary facts found by the Judge were not challenged. Mr Hale’s factual challenge was to the ultimate finding that the pollutant was likely to fall or descend to the Lagoon. In my judgment that ultimate finding was fully supported by the evidence and was correct. 
     
      
    70 The appeal against conviction should be dismissed with costs.  
     
      
    71 HULME J: In or about November 2004, the Respondent to this appeal charged the Appellant with having, on or about 3 October 2003, committed an offence against s120(1) of the Protection of the Environment Operations Act, 1997 in that “it polluted waters at Warabrook Wetland Reserve, namely the Warabrook Lagoon (Upper Pond)”. 
     
      
    72 The offence alleged was particularised in a number of respects. The place of the offence was said to be the Defendant’s land, a line of stormwater drainage pipes and pits owned and occupied by the Defendant, the stormwater drainage pipe and pit system between the Defendant’s land and the Reserve and at the Reserve. The manner in which the pollution occurred was described as:- 
     
      
       
        
        The pollutant was in a position where it was likely to and did fall, descend and be washed into the waters, into a drain designed to receive or pass rainwater, floodwater or other non-polluted waters. 
        
       
       
        
        The pollutant was introduced into the said waters at the said place by passing through the pipes and pits within the defendant’s land and through the public stormwater drainage pipe and pit system to discharge into the Warabrook Lagoon (Upper Pond) on the Warabrook Wetland Reserve. 
        
       
      
    73 On the day on which the offence was alleged to have occurred, poultry egg waste had escaped from a hole in a tank on the Defendant’s land into at least some of the drainage lines and pits on the Defendant’s land. 
     
      
    74 On that day also, Council officers had found adjacent to where material from the Appellant’s drainage system would enter the Lagoon, material which appeared to be of the same type as that which had leaked from the Defendant’s tank. The Council’s primary case was that the material found was part of that that had leaked from the tank. 
     
      
    75 However, drainage pipes from other properties also fed into the Council’s drainage system between the Appellant’s property and this made it at least possible that what the Council officers found in the Lagoon came from persons other than the Defendant. There was also evidence that tended to suggest that the material that had leaked from the tank had not found its way as far as the boundary of the Defendant’s land. Justice Pain, from whom this appeal is brought, was not satisfied that the material found in the Lagoon had come from the Defendant’s property. 
     
      
    76 However, her Honour convicted the Appellant upon a second argument that the Council advanced, namely that given the condition of the tank when inspected on 4 August 2004, the drainage system which existed between the location of the tank, and the inadequacy of emergency procedures to deal with any spillage, the Appellant had offended against s120(1) “by placing egg waste in a position where it was likely to fall, descend, or be washed into Warabrook Lagoon”. On a later occasion, her Honour dealt with the issues of penalty and costs. Clearly orders made in those respects are dependent on the Appellant’s conviction but there is no separate appeal against her Honour’s decisions in respect of these further matters. 
     
      
    77 Her Honour did not make any specific findings as to the condition of the tank at the time of the escape from the tank but it is implicit in what she said that the hole from which the egg waste escaped was the result of the tank rusting. 
     
      
    78 Section 120 of the Act provides:- 
     
      
       
        
        (1) A person who pollutes any waters is guilty of an offence. 
         
        (2) In this section 
         
          
        pollute 
         waters includes cause or permit any waters to be polluted. 
        
       
      
    79 In the Dictionary to the Act, “water pollution or pollution of waters” is defined to mean:- 
     
      
       
        
        “(a) Placing in or on, or otherwise introducing into or onto, waters… any matter… so that the… condition of the waters is changed, or 
        
       
       
        
        (b) Placing in or on, or otherwise introducing into or onto the waters… any… matter… so that the change in the condition of the waters or the… matter… makes, or is likely to make, the waters unclean, noxious… or unsuitable for use in irrigation, or obstructs or interferes with, or is likely to obstruct or interfere with persons in the exercise or enjoyment of any right in relation to the waters, or 
        
       
       
        
        (c) Placing in or on, or otherwise introducing into or onto, the waters… any matter… that is of a prescribed nature… or that does not comply with any standard prescribed in respect of that matter,  
        
       
       
        
        and, without affecting the generality of the foregoing, includes: 
        
       
       
        
        (d) Placing any matter… in a position where: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (i) it falls, descends, is washed, is blown or percolates, or 
           
          (ii) it is likely to fall, descend, be washed, be blown or percolate 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          into any waters, onto the dry bed of any waters, or into any drain, channel or gutter used or designed to receive or pass rainwater, floodwater, or any water that is not polluted, or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (e) Placing any such matter on the dry bed of any waters or in drain, channel or gutter used or designed to receive or pass rainwater, floodwater, or any water that is not polluted,  
        
       
       
        
        if the matter would, had it been placed in any waters, have polluted or have been likely to pollute those waters.” 
        
       
      
    80 The Appellant’s case here is that Justice Pain misconstrued the meaning of the word “likely” in that definition and, when that expression is properly understood, was not justified by the evidence in reaching the conclusion she did. 
     
      
    81 However, I do not need to embark upon this argument for the Council has a more fundamental problem. It is either that there was duplicity in the charge or, as I think is the preferable view, that the Appellant was convicted of an offence different from that charged as that charge was particularised. As the particulars set out above make clear, particulars of the charge included that the pollutant “was in a position “where it was likely to and did fall” and that the pollutant “was introduced into the said waters”, expressions consistent with only an allegation of actual pollution, not of merely creating a situation where pollution was likely to occur.  
     
      
    82 Given the presence of the words underlined in the preceding paragraph, it is not possible to regard the offence charged as one of “placing egg waste in a position where it was likely to fall” etc. And even if one could, the addition of those words or an interpretation that included them would have meant that the charge suffered from duplicity. The Defendant placed the relevant material in the tank at one point in time and, assuming all other relevant matters existed, it then committed an offence. Any offence of introducing the material into the Lagoon, occurred at a different point of time and, if it occurred, was a different offence. 
     
      
    83 In so concluding I do not ignore the fact that, given the terms of s120 and the definition quoted the Council could have charged the offence as it did and particularised that offence, for example, as:- 
     
      
       
        
        “placing matter in a position where:- 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (i) it fell, or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (ii) was likely to fall, descend, be washed, or percolate, 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        into Warabrook Lagoon” 
        
       
      
    84 Given the form of paragraph (d) of the definition of “water pollution …” such phraseology, directing attention to one act which answered one of a number of possible descriptions or carried one of a number of possible consequences, would not have been duplicitous – see Ex parte Polley: Re: McLennan (1947) 47 SR (NSW) 391 at 392; Brownlie v SPCC (1992) 27 NSWLR 78 at 82B; CSR Ltd v Environmental Protection Authority (2000) 110 LGERA 334; Reynolds & Co Pty Limited v Australian Stock Exchange [2003] NSWSC 33 at [101]. However, that is not the way the charge against the Appellant was particularised. There was no allegation of “placing” the pollutant where it was likely to fall and although if there were no contrary indications of what was being alleged, one might have been justified in inferring that was intended, here the clear emphasis was on actual not potential pollution. 
     
      
    85 Nor is it to the point that the charge itself was in the terms of s120 and not formulated in duplicitous terms. The particulars also must not suffer from that fault. This is made clear from the remarks of Dixon J in Johnson v Miller (1937) 59 CLR 467 at 489.  
     
      
    86 The only question which has caused me any concern is whether the Appellant, having made no objection to the course pursued by the Respondent before Pain J should now be permitted to do so. After all, putting aside for the moment the Appellant’s primary argument, on her Honour’s findings the Appellant is guilty of the offence of polluting waters. However, just as “it is not pedantry to insist that an accused be tried for the crime for which he is charged” – Andrews v R (1968) 126 CLR 198 at 209, it is not pedantry to insist that any conviction, if it is to stand, be for that offence. The specification of an offence requires that there be included not only the legal ingredients of it but the identification of its essential factual ingredients also. See Johnson v Miller (1937) 59 CLR 467 at 486, Andrews v R at 209; John L Pty Ltd v Attorney-General (NSW) (1987) 163 CLR 508 at 520; Taylor v EPA (2000) 50 NSWLR 48 at [20-22]. Inter alia, such matters are needed to enable any decision to be made should issues of autrefois acquit or autrefois convict arise – R v Burns (1920) 20 SR (NSW) 357. 
     
      
    87 The appeal should be allowed, and the conviction and penalty quashed and the order for costs made by Judge Pain set aside.  
     
      
    88 No argument was addressed as to the costs of this appeal. Given that the point upon which the appeal has succeeded was not taken below and not taken in the appeal until the Court raised it, there is a deal to be said for the view that the costs of the appeal should lie where they have fallen. However, that is not a concluded view and the parties should have liberty to raise the issue of costs by written submissions within 7 days if they wish to do so.

     Judgment 
      
    1 JAMES J: Barry David Goebel-McGregor (“the appellant”) appealed against his conviction after a trial in the Supreme Court before Newman AJ and a jury on a charge of having murdered Vivien Acheson (“the deceased”), his former de facto wife, at Guyra on 8 December 2002. 
     
      
    2 Newman AJ sentenced the appellant to a term of imprisonment for twenty years with a non-parole period of fifteen years, commencing on 9 December 2002, the date on which the appellant was arrested and from which he had remained in custody. In the event of his appeal against conviction being dismissed, the appellant seeks leave to appeal against the sentence imposed by Newman AJ. 
     
      
    3 When the appellant was indicted before Newman AJ on the charge of murder, he pleaded not guilty of the murder but guilty of the manslaughter of the deceased. The Crown did not accept the plea of guilty of manslaughter in discharge of the indictment and the trial proceeded on the charge of murder. 
     
      
    4 At the trial, consistently with the appellant’s plea of guilty to the manslaughter of the deceased, there was no issue that the deceased had died on 8 December 2002 or that the appellant had done an act causing her death, by shooting her in the back of the head. Nor, notwithstanding assertions by the appellant when he had been interviewed by the police that he had not sighted the firearm before firing it and had intended only to frighten the deceased, was there any real issue that the appellant had shot the deceased with the intent required for murder. The appellant was trained in the use of firearms, the shot had been fired at close range and, as already stated, the projectile had struck the deceased towards the back of the head. 
     
      
    5 The live issues at the trial were whether the Crown could prove beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant had not acted under provocation in shooting the deceased (s 23 Crimes Act) and whether the appellant could prove on the balance of probabilities that at the time of shooting the deceased the appellant’s capacity to understand events or to judge whether his actions were right or wrong or to control himself was substantially impaired by an abnormality of mind arising from an underlying condition and whether any impairment was so substantial as to warrant liability for murder being reduced to manslaughter (s 23A Crimes Act).  
     
      
    6 By returning a verdict of guilty of murder the jury showed that in their view the Crown had succeeded in disproving that the appellant had acted under provocation and the appellant had not succeeded in proving all of the elements of the partial defence of substantial impairment. 
     
      
    7 At the trial evidence was given by a large number of witnesses in the Crown case and a recorded interview of the appellant by police on 9 December 2002 was tendered and admitted into evidence in the Crown case. The appellant gave evidence in the defence case. Two psychiatrists Dr Skinner and Dr Allnutt gave evidence in the defence case relevant to the defence of substantial impairment and another psychiatrist Dr Delaforce gave evidence in a Crown case in reply to the evidence of Dr Skinner and Dr Allnutt. Having regard to the nature of the grounds of appeal against conviction, it will be sufficient to give a fairly concise summary of the evidence at the trial. 
     
      
       
      Summary of Evidence at the Trial 
       
      
    8 The appellant and the deceased entered into a de facto relationship, soon after the deceased arrived in Australia from England in 1994. Two children were born of the relationship between the appellant and the deceased, a boy Cameron who was born on 1 August 1999 and a boy Ryan who was born on 10 August 2001. 
     
      
    9 The relationship between the appellant and the deceased broke down. Prior to the breakdown of the relationship they had been living in Torrington in northern New South Wales. After the breakdown of the relationship the appellant lived in Guyra in a flat in a small block of flats, which he purchased in about December 2001. The deceased remained living at Torrington. 
     
      
    10 On New Year’s Day 2002 the appellant was informed that the deceased had entered into a relationship with a man named Douglas Ellis, who was known to the appellant and who lived in Parkes. On the following day, when the appellant spoke to the deceased, she admitted that she had entered into a relationship with Mr Ellis and told the appellant that the child Ryan had slept in the same bed as the deceased and Mr Ellis. 
     
      
    11 Having received this information, the appellant, who had been exercising access to the child Cameron, refused to return Cameron to the deceased. However, on 18 January 2002 a Local Court, on an application by the deceased, made an order granting each of the appellant and the deceased custody of Cameron in alternate weeks (“week in/week out custody”). No order was made for custody of Ryan, who was still being breast fed by his mother. 
     
      
    12 In the early months of 2002 the deceased twice commenced proceedings against the appellant for apprehended domestic violence orders.  
     
      
    13 On 7 February 2002 the deceased made a statement to a police officer Constable Tucker in support of an application for an apprehended domestic violence order against the appellant. In this statement, which was read at the trial by Constable Tucker in the course of giving her evidence, the deceased said that the appellant had been physically violent towards her on three occasions. In March 1999 he had slapped her on the face following an argument. Later in 1999 after the birth of Cameron, the appellant, while he was wearing his work boots, had kicked the deceased twice in the buttocks, causing bruising. In April 2001 the appellant had thrown a meal on the floor and had slapped the deceased on the head. 
     
      
    14 In his evidence at the trial the appellant admitted that in March 1999 he had slapped the deceased on the face, after an argument in which both of them had been “yelling and screaming”; that he had kicked the deceased but it had not been a serious assault and there had not been any bruising; and that he had thrown a meal on the floor but had not then slapped the deceased. 
     
      
    15 In her statement of 7 February 2002 the deceased said that the appellant had informed her that he intended moving back into the house at Torrington. The deceased said that she was afraid that, if the appellant moved back into the house, there would be further heated arguments and violence. 
     
      
    16 After Constable Tucker had finished reading the deceased’s statement of 7 February 2002, the trial judge directed the jury that the statement was “evidence of relationship between the deceased and the accused… you are not in anyway to use it in connection with any propensities on the accused’s part to violence”. 
     
      
    17 On 15 March 2002 the deceased made a statement to a police officer Constable Cooper in support of a further application for an apprehended domestic violence order. In this statement, which was read at the trial by Constable Cooper in the course of giving his evidence, the deceased said that she had not proceeded with her previous application for an apprehended domestic violence order, because the appellant had told her that he would not be moving back into the house at Torrington. In this statement the deceased said that on 15 March 2002 at the house in Torrington the appellant had said to her:- 
     
      
       
        
        “I am going to break you. If you ever win custody of these two boys I will put a bullet right between your eyes. I was going to do it the other day when you were at my place. I had a loaded rifle there then. You will never see England or your family again. I could do the time. I will only get five years for manslaughter. You will never see your children grow up. You will never see England again”. 
        
       
      
    18 The deceased said in her statement that she had become extremely frightened for her safety. 
     
      
    19 At the trial two witnesses Mr and Mrs Armand gave evidence that at a meeting with the deceased on 17 March 2002 the deceased had told them that the appellant had threatened to kill her by shooting her. Another witness Juanita Haar gave evidence that in a telephone conversation on 18 March 2002 the deceased had told her that the appellant had told the deceased that he would “blow her brains out when she least expected it”. 
     
      
    20 In his evidence at the trial the appellant denied that he had said anything like what the deceased alleged in her statement he had said on 15 March 2002. 
     
      
    21 The deceased did not proceed with her second application for an apprehended domestic violence order.  
     
      
    22 The appellant himself in both the interview with the police and in his evidence at the trial described an incident in which he said the deceased had told him that she had sold a solar panel which the appellant wished to take on a camping trip with Cameron and had “dragged” Cameron away from the appellant. The appellant continued in his answer in the interview by saying that he had said to the deceased:- “Now I can understand why some Australian husbands in my situation take their own lives and their wives’”. 
     
      
    23 A witness Mrs Edwards gave evidence that on 3 March 2002, after the deceased had left her house, the appellant telephoned asking whether the deceased was still there and, when informed that the deceased had left, the appellant had said that he was sick of the deceased’s lies and “I’ll shoot her and the boys”.  
     
      
    24 In his evidence at the trial the appellant admitted that he had told Mrs Edwards that he was sick of the deceased’s lies but denied that he had made a threat to shoot the deceased and the boys, saying that “the boys are my life”. 
     
      
    25 Evidence was given by the appellant about the state of his health in 2002. 
     
      
    26 In April 2002 he had taken Cameron camping and had become soaked by heavy rain. He thought he had then contracted a viral infection, which had lingered on for the rest of the year. At about this time the appellant was prescribed the anti-depressant drug Zoloft and it was revealed that the appellant had high blood pressure. 
     
      
    27 In August and September 2002 the appellant spent about three weeks in a hospital in Armidale, because of his respiratory illness and his state of depression. He was seen by a psychiatrist, who prescribed an increase in the dosage of Zoloft. 
     
      
    28 Proceedings between the deceased and the appellant concerning custody of and access to the two children of the relationship were heard in the Family Court in Tamworth on 28 and 29 November 2002. The appellant had been granted Legal Aid in the Family Court proceedings but at a late stage Legal Aid was withdrawn and the appellant appeared unrepresented. 
     
      
    29 Interim orders only were made by the Family Court in November 2002 and a final hearing was fixed for June 2003. Under the interim orders the appellant’s access to the children was reduced. His access to Cameron was reduced from “week on/week off” access, which had been the position under the Local Court order of 18 January 2002, to weekend access each week. In fact, the appellant erroneously believed that his access had been reduced to weekend access, only every second week. The appellant’s access to Ryan was limited to a few hours each week. The Family Court noted that at the final hearing the deceased would be seeking an order that she have the right to travel to the United Kingdom for a period of two months in every two year period for the purpose of visiting her family with her children. 
     
      
    30 The appellant gave evidence that, after the Family Court had given its decision, the deceased had told the appellant:- “I told you. You can’t win”. 
     
      
    31 The appellant said in his evidence that he had found it “too painful” to go to Torrington, where he had formerly lived and where Mr Ellis now sometimes stayed, to pick up the children and he tried to negotiate some other place for the picking up and returning of the children. 
     
      
    32 The appellant gave evidence both in the interview and at the trial about an unusual incident which had occurred on 4 December 2002. The appellant had agreed to assist a recently widowed woman to remove goods from a property at Ben Lomond. While the appellant was at the property, a woman on a motorcycle, who claimed to be the owner of the land, drove the motorcycle at the appellant and ran over his leg. Furthermore, a man carrying a hammer attempted to strike the appellant with the hammer. The appellant believed that his life was in danger and police were called. It rained while the appellant was at the property and he became very ill again from his respiratory illness. 
     
      
    33 On Friday 6 December 2002 the appellant drove to Torrington and picked up Cameron for the purpose of exercising weekend access, in accordance with the interim order of the Family Court. 
     
      
    34 The appellant also picked up a woman named Kerryanne Hunt, who lived in Glen Innes. Ms Hunt and her de facto partner Mr Geoffrey Orchard were known to the appellant. Ms Hunt was to stay over the weekend in one of the flats in the block of flats owned by the appellant, to assist the appellant, who was ill, in caring for Cameron and to help herself to abstain from drinking alcohol.  
     
      
    35 The appellant drove Cameron and Ms Hunt to Guyra.  
     
      
    36 The appellant was ill in bed all of Saturday 7 December 2002. In his evidence at the trial he claimed, for the first time, that he had had a sensation of “floating above the bed”. 
     
      
    37 On the night of Saturday 7 December 2002 the appellant telephoned the deceased and told her that he would be too ill to drive Cameron back to Torrington the following day and the deceased agreed that she would herself pick up Cameron at Guyra. 
     
      
    38 On the morning of Sunday 8 December 2002 the appellant telephoned the deceased and requested that she pick up Mr Orchard and bring him to Guyra. The deceased agreed. 
     
      
    39 In the recorded interview the appellant gave a detailed account of what he said had happened on 8 December 2002. In his evidence given at the trial the appellant said that what he had said in the interview was true, that his recollection was now not as clear and “my mind doesn’t want me to remember”. 
     
      
    40 The following account is taken from answers in the appellant’s interview and evidence given by other persons who were at Guyra on 8 December 2002.  
     
      
    41 The deceased arrived at the appellant’s flat in Guyra at about 4 o’clock in the afternoon. She was accompanied by Mr Orchard and the younger child Ryan. Already present at the flat were the appellant, Cameron, Ms Hunt and a man named Michael Kidd, who worked for the appellant in a Mr Whippy ice cream franchise held by the appellant in Armidale and who had been living in one of the flats in the building owned by the appellant since about October 2002.  
     
      
    42 A suggestion was made (the evidence is conflicting as to who made the suggestion) that all of Mr Kidd, Mr Orchard and Ms Hunt should go to a nearby hotel, leaving the appellant and the deceased alone together, so that they could talk to each other in private. Mr Kidd drove himself and the other two to the hotel in the appellant’s 4-wheel drive vehicle.  
     
      
    43 After they had been left alone together the appellant and the deceased discussed various matters. The following questions and answers occurred in the appellant’s interview by police:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Q 172 (A)……(the deceased said) And if you think I came down here to pick up the boys to do you a favour, you can, don’t think I did you any favour. And I said, What do you mean? And she said, I’m heading down to Doug’s with the boys from here, in Parkes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q 173 Yes? 
        
       
       
        
        A. And she said, And if it’s, if it’s of any interest to you, or something like that, because you’ve been whining about it for so long, if you must know, Ryan will be sleeping in the bed with Doug and I, or me and Doug, Doug and I, and if Cameron wants to sleep in with us, he can too. And then she repeated, she said, I told you you can’t, and that I’m going to beat you. She was drinking a cup of coffee at the time. I walked out of the room……and I walked out, undid the padlock on the gun cabinet and took out a rife. 
        
       
       
        
        Q174 Yes, what happened then? 
        
       
       
        
        A. When I came back into the lounge, the boys were still in the next paddock. And she’d just gone out into the kitchen. She heard me walk in the lounge, she walked out the kitchen and she was washing her cup. And she said, And by the way, before I win the court case in June, Doug and I will be going, taking the boys and going to England and you’ll never see your boys again. 
        
       
       
        
        Q175 What happened then? 
        
       
       
        
        A. She turned round and started to smile at me. I was…..” 
        
       
      
    44 The appellant said elsewhere in the interview that he had taken a .22 rifle out of the gun cabinet and had put a magazine with bullets in it into the rifle. 
     
      
    45 In evidence given at the trial the appellant said that he had fired, when he was at a distance of about two to three metres from the deceased. In his answer to question 344 in the interview the appellant said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “I don’t think I even meant to kill her…. I wanted to frighten the shit out of her. I wanted to make her see how much it was hurting me” 
        
       
      
    46 In evidence at the trial the appellant said:- “I wasn’t myself. I feel I must have been crazy. Absolutely crazy.” He had not planned to shoot the deceased. 
     
      
    47 After shooting the deceased, the appellant collected the two children from where they had been playing in another flat. The appellant made a telephone call to an adult child by a previous de facto relationship who lived in Sydney, saying that he was bringing the children to Sydney. 
     
      
    48 The appellant also telephoned Mr Kidd at the hotel and asked him to bring back the 4-wheel drive vehicle, so that the appellant could detach a child’s car seat from the vehicle. Mr Kidd drove himself, Mr Orchard and Ms Hunt back to the block of flats. The appellant looked in the back of the vehicle but there was no child’s car seat there. The child’s car seat the appellant was looking for had in fact been placed by the deceased in the vehicle in which she had driven to Guyra. While the three other persons were outside the block of flats, the appellant told them that “things were going well with Vivien” at a time when the deceased was already dead. Mr Kidd, Mr Orchard and Ms Hunt then returned to the hotel. 
     
      
    49 Each of Mr Orchard and Ms Hunt, but not Mr Kidd, gave evidence at the trial that, while they were back at the flats on this occasion, they saw the deceased on the verandah of the appellant’s flat, although, according to the account given by the appellant in the police interview and in evidence given at the trial, she was already dead.  
     
      
    50 The appellant left Guyra, travelling to Sydney with the two children in the vehicle which the deceased had driven to Guyra. When he had reached only as far as Black Mountain, a few kilometres from Guyra, he telephoned Ms Hunt at the hotel and told her that Mr Kidd should drive Mr Orchard and Ms Hunt back to Glen Innes and then, instead of returning to Guyra, Mr Kidd should go directly to work at Armidale the following day. 
     
      
    51 In accordance with this direction given by the appellant, Mr Kidd, Mr Orchard and Ms Hunt headed towards Glen Innes. After they had travelled some distance, Ms Hunt realised that she had left her handbag in the appellant’s flat and the trio returned to Guyra.  
     
      
    52 Mr Kidd entered the appellant’s flat and discovered the dead body of the deceased lying on the kitchen floor with a wound to the back of the head. Mr Kidd and Mr Orchard went to a police station and reported the death of the deceased. 
     
      
    53 The appellant continued driving to Sydney with the two children. He arrived at the house of a daughter by a previous marriage very early in the morning of Monday 9 December 2002. Later that morning he contacted a solicitor. He also telephoned a friend in New Zealand and spoke to the friend’s wife, whose name is Shirley De Goldie. In an answer in the interview the appellant said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “I said, Shirley, there’s been some 
          
        trouble and she said ‘You didn’t, Barry?’ and I said ‘Shirley, I took her out of the picture’”. 
        
       
      
    54 Later on 9 December 2002 the appellant participated in a long recorded interview by police in which he made many admissions. 
     
      
    55 As already stated earlier in this judgment, three psychiatrists gave evidence, two in the defence case and one in the Crown case in reply. It is unnecessary to refer to this evidence in much detail.  
     
      
    56 Dr Skinner gave evidence that she was of the opinion that as at 8 December 2002 the appellant was suffering from a major depressive illness, which would have been aggravated by his respiratory illness. The incident at Ben Lomond might have caused a deterioration in his mental state. Dr Skinner considered that as at 8 December 2002 the appellant’s capacity to control himself and to make rational decisions would have been impaired by his mental state. 
     
      
    57 In cross-examination Dr Skinner said that, at the time she formed her opinions, she had not been aware of any threats made by the appellant against the deceased and she agreed that a prior history of violence or threats of violence by the appellant against the deceased would cause her to change her opinion.  
     
      
    58 Dr Allnutt gave evidence that he had formed the opinion that as at 8 December 2002 the appellant manifested symptoms of a depressive disorder and an acute stress disorder and was also physically unwell and experiencing symptoms of dissociation. Dr Allnutt was further of the opinion that these conditions had impacted on the appellant’s capacity to judge and control his actions.  
     
      
    59 In cross-examination Dr Allnutt agreed that the information available to him, at the time he formed his opinions, did not include information about a threat to kill the deceased in a way similar to the way in which she had been killed but asserted that such information would not cause him to change his opinions. 
     
      
    60 Dr Delaforce gave evidence that he was of the opinion that as at 8 December 2002 the appellant had an underlying condition of a major depressive disorder and an adjustment disorder and that both disorders would qualify as being an underlying condition causing an abnormality of mind. However, he did not believe that this underlying condition had impaired the appellant’s capacity to understand events, to judge his actions as right or wrong or to control himself. 
     
      
       
      Grounds of Appeal 
       
      
    61 The appellant’s grounds of appeal were:- 
     
      
       
      1. His Honour the Learned Trial Judge erred in law in his directions to the jury under s 23 of the  
      Crimes Act 1900 in that: 
       
       
        
        (a) the jury was misdirected as to the permissible considerations under subs (2)(b); 
        
       
       
       (b) the jury was directed in breach of subs (3)(a); and 
       
       
        
        (c) following (a) & (b) above, the jury should have been directed on ‘reasonable proportion’ under subs (3)(a). 
        
       
       
      2. His Honour the Learned Trial Judge erred in law in his directions to the jury under s 23 of the  
      Crimes Act 1900  
      in that the jury was further misdirected as to the law of provocation under subs (2)(b). 
       
       
      3. His Honour the Learned Trial Judge erred in law in failing to direct the jury as to consciousness of guilt in that: 
       
       
        
        (a) the jury was not directed as to the proper use of the evidence of the Appellant’s lie; and 
        
       
       
        
        (b) the jury was not directed as to the proper use of the evidence of the Appellant’s conduct following the shooting of the deceased. 
        
       
       
      4. His Honour the Learned Trial Judge erred in law in failing to direct the jury as to limits on the use of relationship evidence in the nature of past assaults. 
       
       
      5. His Honour erred in failing to discharge the jury. 
       
       
      6. His Honour the Learned Trial Judge erred in the sentencing process in the particular circumstances of the Applicant and thereby the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive. 
       
      
    62 The first five grounds of appeal are grounds of appeal against the appellant’s conviction and the sixth ground of appeal is a ground of appeal against the sentence imposed on him. I will deal with these grounds of appeal in turn. 
     
      
       
      1. His Honour the Learned Trial Judge erred in law in his directions to the jury under s 23 of the  
      Crimes Act 1900 in that: 
       
       
        
        (a) the jury was misdirected as to the permissible considerations under subs (2)(b); 
        
       
       
       (b) the jury was directed in breach of subs (3)(a); and 
       
       
        
        (c) following (a) & (b) above, the jury should have been directed on ‘reasonable proportion’ under subs (3)(a). 
        
       
      
    63 It is convenient to commence my consideration of this ground of appeal by setting out the provisions of s 23 of the Crimes Act dealing with provocation. 
     
      
       
        
        (1) 
         Where, on the trial of a person for murder, it appears that the act or omission causing death was an act done or omitted under provocation and, but for this subsection and the provocation, the jury would have found the accused guilty of murder, the jury shall acquit the accused of murder and find the accused guilty of manslaughter. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) 
         For the purposes of subsection (1), an act or omission causing death is an act done or omitted under provocation where:  
         
        (a) the act or omission is the result of a loss of self-control on the part of the accused that was induced by any conduct of the deceased (including grossly insulting words or gestures) towards or affecting the accused, and  
         
        (b) that conduct of the deceased was such as could have induced an ordinary person in the position of the accused to have so far lost self-control as to have formed an intent to kill, or to inflict grievous bodily harm upon, the deceased, whether that conduct of the deceased occurred immediately before the act or omission causing death or at any previous time 
        . 
        
       
       
        
        (3) 
         For the purpose of determining whether an act or omission causing death was an act done or omitted under provocation as provided by subsection (2), there is no rule of law that provocation is negatived if:  
         
        (a) there was not a reasonable proportion between the act or omission causing death and the conduct of the deceased that induced the act or omission,  
         
        (b) the act or omission causing death was not an act done or omitted suddenly, or  
         
        (c) the act or omission causing death was an act done or omitted with any intent to take life or inflict grievous bodily harm. 
        
       
       
        
        (4) 
         Where, on the trial of a person for murder, there is any evidence that the act causing death was an act done or omitted under provocation as provided by subsection (2), the onus is on the prosecution to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the act or omission causing death was not an act done or omitted under provocation. 
        
       
       
        
        (5) 
         This section does not exclude or limit any defence to a charge of murder. 
         
         
        
       
      
    64 In directing the jury about provocation and in particular about s 23(2)(b) of the Crimes Act the trial judge said in his summing-up that a question to be determined by the jury was:- 
     
      
       
        
        “May the conduct of the deceased have induced an ordinary person in the position of the accused to have so far lost self control as to have formed an intent to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm, serious bodily harm on the deceased?” 
        
       
      
    65 The trial judge then gave the jury directions to be applied by them in determining this second question. His Honour said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “An ordinary person members of the jury, is simply one who has the minimum powers of self control expected of an ordinary citizen who is sober and is of the same age and sex as the accused. When one speaks of the effect of provocation on an ordinary person in the position of the accused, that phrase means an ordinary person who has been provoked to the same degree of severity and for the same reason as the accused. 
        
       
       
        
        In the present case this translates to a person who with the minimum powers of self control of an ordinary person, as I have described earlier, and is subjected to the litigation between the deceased and the accused, remarks made by the deceased to the accused, and the whole context of the relationship between the deceased and the accused and in particular the events said to have occurred at the premises at Guyra on 8 December 2002. 
        
       
       
        
        This question requires you to take full account of the sting of provocation actually experienced by the accused, but eliminates from your consideration an extraordinary response, if such there be, by the accused to the provocation actually experienced. Thus, extraordinary aggressiveness or extraordinary want of self control on the part of the accused provides no protection against a conviction for murder. You should understand that when you are dealing with this question you are considering the possible reaction of an ordinary person in the position of the accused, not the inevitable or probable reaction, but his possible reaction”. 
        
       
      
    66 After completing his directions of law on the subject of provocation and before beginning a survey of the evidence relevant to provocation the trial judge asked counsel in the absence of the jury whether there were any “problems” so far in the summing-up. Neither counsel raised any problem. 
     
      
    67 On this appeal it was submitted on behalf of the appellant that the trial judge had misdirected the jury in the part of these directions in which his Honour said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “This question requires you to take full account of the sting of provocation actually experienced by the accused, but eliminates from your consideration an extraordinary response, if such there be, by the accused to the provocation actually experienced. Thus, extraordinary aggressiveness or extraordinary want of self control on the part of the accused provides no protection against a conviction for murder.” 
        
       
      
    68 It was submitted on behalf of the appellant that under s 23(2)(b) of the Crimes Act the jury is required to determine whether the Crown has negatived any reasonable possibility that the conduct of the deceased was such as could have caused an ordinary person in the position of the accused to have so far lost self-control as to have formed an intent to kill or to inflict grievous bodily harm and not whether the Crown has negatived any reasonable possibility that the conduct of the deceased was such as could have caused an ordinary person in the position of the accused to have so far lost self-control as to have formed an intent to respond, that is to act or omit to act, in the way in which the accused actually did. Counsel for the appellant referred to Green v The Queen (1997) 191 CLR 334. It was submitted that the direction given by his Honour which used the word “response” had wrongly required the jury to consider whether the conduct of the deceased was such as could have caused an ordinary person in the position of the appellant to have responded in the way in which the appellant had or whether, on the other hand, the appellant’s response was “extraordinary”, that is beyond any possible response of an ordinary person in the position of the appellant. 
     
      
    69 It was further submitted by counsel for the appellant that the direction given by his Honour was contrary to s 23(3)(a) which provides that there is no rule of law that provocation is negatived, if there is not a reasonable proportion between the act or omission causing death and the conduct of the deceased that induced the act or omission. 
     
      
    70 It is clear that under s 23(2)(b) the relevant question is whether the conduct of the deceased was such as could have induced an ordinary person in the position of the accused to have so far lost self-control as to have formed an intent to kill the deceased or to inflict grievous bodily harm on the deceased and not whether the conduct of the deceased was such as could have induced an ordinary person in the position of the accused to have so far lost self-control as to have responded, that is acted, in the way in which the accused did. (See Green v The Queen especially per Toohey J at 355-358 and per Gummow J at 377-378. 
     
      
    71 At page 378 Gummow J said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Even without s 23(3)(a), the requirement of proportionality may have been removed by the enactment of s 23(2)(b). The extent of the relevant loss of self-control referred to in that section is the forming of ‘an intent to kill, or to inflict grievous bodily harm upon, the deceased’. Paragraph (b) does not allow consideration of the actual act or omission of the accused causing death and hence there is no occasion for a consideration of the proportion between those acts or omissions and the conduct of the deceased 
        ”. 
        
       
      
    72 It is to be accepted that the submissions of counsel for the appellant are not without some foundation. However, in the recent decision of this Court in R v Khalouf [2005] NSWCCA 395 similar issues to those raised by the present appellant were raised and were decided adversely to the appellant Khalouf. 
     
      
    73 In Khalouf the same trial judge had given identical directions of law about s 23(2)(b) of the Crimes Act, except that in Khalouf he had inserted the words “act of” between the words “extraordinary” and “aggressiveness”, so that the sentence in which those words appeared read “Thus, extraordinary act of aggressiveness or extraordinary want of self-control on the part of the accused provides no protection against a conviction for murder”. 
     
      
    74 In Khalouf the Chief Judge at Common Law, with whom the other members of the Court agreed, while noting a concession by the Crown that the trial judge’s directions could have been “more felicitously expressed”, held that, in the context of the whole of the trial judge’s directions with respect to s 23(2)(b), the jury would have understood that the question they had to determine was “whether the deceased’s conduct may have induced an ordinary person in the position of the accused to have so far lost self-control as to have formed the requisite intent” (at par 78). The Chief Judge added that, even if, contrary to what he had just said, the direction given by the trial judge had carried a possibility of being misunderstood by the jury, it was significant that counsel at the trial had not raised any objection. 
     
      
    75 In my opinion, the present case is not distinguishable, in favour of the appellant, from Khalouf. The one respect in which the directions of law given in the present case were different from the directions of law given in Khalouf is that in Khalouf, but not in the present case, the trial judge had used the expression “act of (aggressiveness)” but that difference, if of any significance, would have tended to make the directions in Khalouf more likely to be misleading. In both cases no application for any further or different direction was made by counsel for the accused at the trial. 
     
      
    76 In R v Mai (1992) 26 NSWLR 371 Hunt CJ at CL said at 380 with the concurrence of the other members of the Court, in a passage which has since been referred to with approval on a number of occasions:- 
     
      
       
        
        “This Court, like the Court of Appeal (and the Full Court before it), has never regarded itself as bound by its previous decisions… Unlike the Court of Appeal, this Court has no practice of requiring the grant of leave before an earlier decision may be re-examined. It has nevertheless departed from previous decisions only with caution, and only when it is satisfied that justice seemed to require the earlier decision to be overturned. In some cases, the Chief Justice has assembled a court of more than three judges to re-examine an earlier decision…. but this practice has been by no means uniform…” 
        
       
      
    77 I do not consider that the present Court should depart from the decision in Khalouf, which is a recent unanimous decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal, and, on the authority of Khalouf, I would reject this ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      Further Submission purportedly in support of the First Ground of Appeal 
       
      
    78 A further submission was made by counsel for the appellant which was said to be a further submission in support of the first ground of appeal. In fact, it was not a submission in support of the first ground of appeal but a quite independent submission. Notwithstanding that the submission was not relevant to any of the grounds of appeal which had been filed, the Court considered the submission. 
     
      
    79 The further submission was based on a passage in the trial judge’s summing-up at p 11 in which his Honour said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “You should consider the concept of provocation before you consider the defence of substantial impairment by abnormality of mind. You would only consider that latter defence if you were of the view that the Crown had failed to negative the concept of provocation”. 
        
       
      
    80 It was submitted that this direction was erroneous, in that the jury would have to consider the defence of substantial impairment, not if the Crown failed to negative provocation, but if the Crown succeeded in negativing provocation. 
     
      
    81 What his Honour said in this passage in the summing-up was clearly erroneous, for the reason given by counsel for the appellant. However, elsewhere in the summing-up, as was conceded by counsel for the appellant, the trial judge had correctly directed the jury.  
     
      
    82 At pp 22-23 of the summing-up the trial judge directed the jury that their verdict should be a verdict of guilty of murder, if the jury were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the elements of the offence of murder and that the appellant had not acted under provocation and the jury also found that the appellant had not made out on the balance of probabilities that his actions arose from substantial impairment by abnormality of mind. 
     
      
    83 At p 23 of the summing-up the trial judge directed the jury that, if they concluded that the Crown had not negatived provocation, they would not need to consider the question of substantial impairment by abnormality of mind.  
     
      
    84 At p 40 of the summing-up the trial judge said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        Now, as I have already told you, this question only arises for your consideration if you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the Crown has established all of the essential ingredients of the crime of murder, including that the accused was not acting under provocation. If it has done so, you next come to this question of ‘impaired responsibility’, as I shall call it”. 
        
       
      
    85 At the trial there was no relevant application by counsel for the appellant for any further direction.  
     
      
    86 I am satisfied that the error made by his Honour, which was made at an early stage of the summing-up, was corrected by what his Honour said later in the summing-up and that by the end of the summing-up the jury well understood that, if the Crown proved all the elements of the offence of murder and also proved that the appellant had not acted under provocation, the jury would still have to determine whether the appellant had established the partial defence of substantial impairment. 
     
      
    87 I would reject this further submission. 
     
      
       
      2. His Honour the Learned Trial Judge erred in law in his directions to the jury under s 23 of the  
      Crimes Act 1900  
      in that the jury was further misdirected as to the law of provocation under subs (2)(b) 
       
      
    88 This ground of appeal was based on a part of his Honour’s summing-up where his Honour, in summarising the law about provocation, said it was an element of provocation that “the conduct of the deceased was such that it would have induced an ordinary person in the position of the accused to have so far lost self-control as to have formed an intent to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm”. 
     
      
    89 On this appeal it was submitted by counsel for the appellant that the use of the word “would” and not the word “could” was a misdirection and a serious misdirection. It was pointed out that the section itself uses the word “could” and it would be possible that conduct of a deceased person “could” have induced an ordinary person in the position of an accused to have lost self-control to the extent required, even if it would not be possible to say that the conduct of the deceased “would” have induced such a loss of self-control. See Green v The Queen at 340 per Brennan CJ. 
     
      
    90 What his Honour said in the part of the summing-up which I have quoted was clearly erroneous. However, elsewhere in the summing-up the jury were correctly directed. The trial judge read to the jury the terms of the section, which include the word “could”. The second question which the trial judge posed for the jury was “may” the conduct of the deceased have induced a loss of self-control to the extent required. His Honour told the jury that “when you are dealing with this question you are considering the possible reaction of an ordinary person in the position of the accused, not the inevitable or probable reaction but his possible reaction”. 
     
      
    91 At the trial there was no relevant application by counsel for the appellant for any further direction. 
     
      
    92 I am satisfied that a jury would have understood from the summing-up, taken as a whole, that the question the jury had to determine was whether the conduct of the deceased could have induced a loss of self-control to the extent required and not whether the conduct of the deceased would have induced such a loss of control. 
     
      
    93 I would refuse leave under r 4 in relation to this ground. 
     
      
       
      3. His Honour the Learned Trial Judge erred in law in failing to direct the jury as to consciousness of guilt in that: 
       
       
        
        (a) the jury was not directed as to the proper use of the evidence of the Appellant’s lie; and 
        
       
       
        
        (b) the jury was not directed as to the proper use of the evidence of the Appellant’s conduct following the shooting of the deceased 
        
       
      
    94 In summarising the evidence at the trial I referred to evidence given by the appellant in which he admitted telling a lie to Mr Kidd, Mr Orchard and Ms Hunt when they returned to the flats in the 4-wheel drive vehicle, while the appellant was still at the flats. The appellant gave evidence that he said to the three persons that things were going well with the deceased, at a time when, according to the appellant, he had already killed the deceased. 
     
      
    95 In my survey of the evidence I also referred to evidence given by each of Mr Orchard and Ms Hunt, in conflict with the appellant’s evidence that the deceased had already been killed, that on this visit each of them had seen the deceased on the verandah of the appellant’s flat. 
     
      
    96 In his closing address to the jury the Crown Prosecutor referred to the conflict between the evidence of the appellant and the evidence of Mr Orchard and Ms Hunt. The Crown Prosecutor then said to the jury:- 
     
      
       
        
        “But if she had been dead, and that is the accused’s version, as you would appreciate, what the accused has done is lie to his friends to make sure they didn’t go into the house, to make sure that he could make his get away, get to Sydney before DOCS got there. So if he were prepared to lie about that, what else was he prepared to lie about?” 
        
       
      
    97 In one other place in his closing address the Crown Prosecutor referred to the appellant “lying to his friends deliberately to make good his get away”. 
     
      
    98 It was submitted by counsel for the appellant on this appeal that in these parts of his closing address the Crown Prosecutor at the trial had sought to rely on the telling of the lie as evidence of consciousness of guilt. However, no directions of the kind required by Edwards v The Queen (1993) 178 CLR 193 had been given by the trial judge to the jury.  
     
      
    99 In my opinion, although the Crown Prosecutor did suggest a motive the appellant would have had for telling a lie (if it was a lie), the Crown Prosecutor in his closing address did not seek to rely on the telling of the lie as evidence of consciousness of guilt but simply as evidence damaging the appellant’s credibility. The concluding part of the principal submission made by the Crown Prosecutor was:- 
     
      
       
        
        “So if he was prepared to lie about that, what else was he prepared to lie about?” 
        
       
      
    100 There is no indication in the trial judge’s summing-up that the telling of the lie or any of the appellant’s other conduct after the shooting was relied on by the Crown as being evidence of consciousness of guilt. Evidence about these matters was, of course, relevant to the issues of provocation and substantial impairment.  
     
      
    101 No application was made at the trial that directions be given in accordance with Edwards. 
     
      
    102 I would refuse leave under r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules in relation to this ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      4. His Honour the Learned Trial Judge erred in law in failing to direct the jury as to limits on the use of relationship evidence in the nature of past assaults 
       
      
    103 Earlier in this judgment, in my summary of the evidence at the trial, I referred to evidence given at the trial about a number of acts of violence or threats of violence by the appellant against the deceased. The only part of this evidence relied on by counsel for the appellant in support of this ground of appeal was the evidence in the deceased’s statement of 7 February 2002 taken by Constable Tucker that in March 1999 the appellant had slapped the deceased on the face, that later in 1999 he had kicked the deceased in the buttocks and that in April 2001 he had thrown a meal on the floor and had slapped the deceased on the head.  
     
      
    104 In the summing-up the trial judge referred to the evidence in the deceased’s statement about these incidents and also to the evidence the appellant had given about each of these incidents. 
     
      
    105 It was submitted on behalf of the appellant in support of this ground of appeal that the trial judge should have directed the jury that they could not use the evidence about these three incidents as evidence of a tendency on the part of the appellant to be violent to the deceased.  
     
      
    106 In fact, at the time when the evidence was admitted, the trial judge had directed the jury that the deceased’s statement was “evidence of relationship between the deceased and the accused… you are not in any way to use it in connection with any propensities on the accused’s part to violence”. 
     
      
    107 In his summing-up to the jury the trial judge directed the jury that the evidence of the previous acts of violence was relevant to both provocation and substantial impairment. 
     
      
    108 In my opinion, the direction given by the trial judge in the summing-up was correct and there was no need for any further direction in the summing-up. Evidence that on occasions in the past the appellant had acted violently towards the deceased was relevant to assessing the probability of whether, on the occasion he shot the deceased, the appellant did the act of shooting as a result of a loss of self-control and whether, at the time of the shooting, the appellant’s capacity in the respects stated in s 23A was substantially impaired by an abnormality of mind arising from an underlying condition. 
     
      
    109 No request for any further direction was made by counsel for the appellant at the trial. 
     
      
    110 I would refuse leave under r 4 in relation to this ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      5. His Honour erred in failing to discharge the jury 
       
      
    111 Some time after the jury had retired they sent the trial judge a note, asking that further directions be given. The note began with the words:- “If definition of self-control (Macquarie Dictionary) is ability to control one’s behaviour and not act emotionally….” 
     
      
    112 An application was made to discharge the jury on the grounds that these words in the note showed that the jury, in disobedience to directions given by the trial judge, had had regard to extraneous matter, namely a dictionary. The trial judge refused the application for a discharge of the jury and gave a judgment stating his reasons. In part of his judgment his Honour said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “… there needs to be a high degree of need for discharge, it is appropriate for the trial judge to take into account the length of time the trial has occupied, the question of inconvenience to witnesses, and indeed, the cost of another trial….. 
        
       
       
        
         
        What is the important question….is whether there is a tangible risk that the accused would be denied a fair trial by reason of the event which has occurred, and, second, whether the problem cannot be appropriately cured by a direction to the jury”. 
        
       
      
    113 His Honour decided that any problem could be cured by further directions to the jury. There is no further trial transcript available but I am prepared to assume that his Honour gave the jury the further directions he proposed giving. 
     
      
    114 In my opinion, it has not been shown that his Honour erred in not discharging the jury or that his Honour’s decision not to discharge the jury led to any miscarriage of justice. 
     
      
    115 The jury’s conduct in consulting a general dictionary (and not a law book) in an attempt to ascertain the meaning of “self-control”, was only a minor impropriety and the definition the jury obtained was correct and, indeed, almost tautologically correct. 
     
      
    116 It was open to the trial judge to be satisfied that the jury’s action in consulting a dictionary was not indicative of a general tendency on the part of the jury to disobey the trial judge’s directions.  
     
      
    117 I would dismiss this ground of appeal. 
     
      
    118 Having rejected all of the grounds of appeal against conviction or having refused leave under r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules to rely on them, I would dismiss the appeal against conviction. 
     
      
       
      6. His Honour the Learned Trial Judge erred in the sentencing process in the particular circumstances of the Applicant and thereby the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive 
       
      
    119 As recorded earlier in this judgment, Newman AJ sentenced the appellant to a head sentence of twenty years with a non-parole period of fifteen years. 
     
      
    120 As the offence was committed before 1 February 2003, the standard non-parole period provided for in Div 1A of Pt 4 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act was not applicable. 
     
      
    121 On the hearing of this appeal there was no challenge to any of the findings made by Newman AJ in his remarks on sentence. 
     
      
    122 The findings made by his Honour about the objective facts of the offence included the following:- 
     
      
       
      During 2002 the appellant suffered from a depressive illness as a result of various stresses upon him brought about by the breakdown of the relationship with the deceased and the battles for custody of the children. 
       
       
      It was not merely a coincidence that the appellant had killed the deceased in almost the same way as he had threatened to do in March 2002. The shooting on 8 December 2002 had not been planned but “the prisoner did not dismiss the option of destroying his former partner from his mind”. 
       
       
      Mr Kidd, Mr Orchard and Ms Hunt had left the flat and gone to the hotel, as a result of a suggestion made by one of them and not at the instance of the appellant.  
       
       
      At the time of the shooting the appellant had intended to kill the deceased. After the shooting the appellant had done nothing to assist the deceased (although it might be queried what he could have done).  
       
       
      The appellant’s subsequent acts in making the telephone calls and in telling the lie to the group of three persons showed that he was then “in full control”.  
       
       
      The appellant’s actions had deprived two very young children of their mother.  
       
      
    123 After making his findings about the objective facts of the offence, Newman AJ concluded that the offence did not fall within the worst class of cases and hence a life sentence should not be imposed. 
     
      
    124 Newman AJ made the following findings about the subjective features of the appellant.  
     
      
       
      The appellant was born on 23 April 1940 and hence was sixty-two years old at the time of the offence and sixty-four years old at the time he was sentenced. At the time he was sentenced the appellant had a life expectancy of 17.36 years.  
       
       
      The appellant had a minor criminal record, which his Honour disregarded for the purposes of sentencing him for the murder. As already noted, his Honour found that the appellant had been suffering from a depressive illness. 
       
       
      At the time the appellant was sentenced he was suffering from back trouble and had undergone surgery for prostate cancer. 
       
       
      His Honour found that there was much in the offender’s past life to be commended, including military service, his work history and his contribution to community activities and to the rehabilitation of persons suffering from drug and alcohol dependency. 
       
      
    125 After completing his findings about the subjective features of the appellant his Honour concluded:- 
     
      
       
        
        “However, despite the many favourable subjective features in the prisoner’s case, the inescapable fact is that he carried out a cowardly and brutal act of murder. Shooting a defenceless woman in the back of the head cannot be categorised in any lesser manner”. 
        
       
      
    126 It was submitted on behalf of the appellant that the sentence imposed by his Honour was manifestly excessive and that his Honour, having decided that the offence did not call for a life sentence, had imposed a sentence which, having regard to the prisoner’s age and life expectancy, was tantamount to a life sentence. 
     
      
    127 Although a lighter sentence than the sentence imposed by Newman AJ might have been imposed, particularly having regard to the appellant’s depressive illness, the sentence imposed by his Honour was not, in my opinion, outside the range of sentences within a sound exercise of his Honour’s sentencing discretion. 
     
      
    128 As regards the further submission made by counsel for the appellant, it is true that this Court has said that, if a life sentence is to be imposed, it should be imposed “frankly and directly” and a sentencing court which refrains from imposing a life sentence should not impose a determinate sentence which would have the effect of a life sentence. R v Chen (2003) 138 A Crim R 433 at 444 (67). However, a sentence must reflect the objective seriousness of the offence and when the offender is of advanced years a determinate sentence, in order to reflect the objective seriousness of the offence, may unavoidably extend for all or most of the offender’s life expectancy. In DesRosiers v Regina [2006] NSWCCA 16 Latham J, with whom the other members of the Court agreed, referred with approval at par 30 of her judgment to a statement by Allen J in R v Holyoak (1995) 82 A Crim R 502 at 507:- 
     
      
       
        
        “It simply is not the law that it can never be appropriate to impose a minimum term which will have the effect, because of the advanced age of the offender, that he well may spend the whole of his remaining life in custody”. 
        
       
      
    129 In the present case the appellant was sixty-two years old at the time he committed the offence of murder by what the sentencing judge found to be a cowardly and brutal act. It was inevitable that there would be a real risk of the appellant dying in custody, before he completed serving even the non-parole period of any sentence which adequately reflected the objective seriousness of the offence.  
     
      
    130 I would grant leave to appeal against sentence but would dismiss the appeal against sentence. 
     
      
    131 HIDDEN J: I agree with James J 
     
      
    132 HISLOP J: I agree with James J.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 SIMPSON J: On 20 September 2005 the applicant entered a plea of guilty to a charge on an indictment of taking part in the supply of a prohibited drug (methylamphetamine), in an amount of 102.39 grams. The offence was committed on 15 June 2005. The applicant asked that two further offences, identified on a Form 1, be taken into account pursuant to the procedures provided for by Part 3, Division 3 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (“the Act”). They were one offence of possession of a precursor with the intent that it be used in the manufacture of the prohibited drug, and one offence of possession of a prohibited drug (the drug commonly known as LSD). 
     
      
    2 The charge on the indictment was brought under the provisions of s25 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985, and carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 15 years. On 8 December 2005 Woods DCJ sentenced the applicant to imprisonment with a total term of four and a half years, made up of a non-parole period of two years and three months and a balance of term of two years and three months. In order to do so, he found that special circumstances pursuant to s44(2) of the Act existed, justifying departure from the ratio between the non-parole period and the head sentence there stated. The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the sentence. 
     
      
       
      The facts 
       
      
    3 The facts may be simply stated. During the day of 15 June 2005 the applicant called at a number of pharmacies in the Taree district. At each he obtained one packet of Sudafed. Sudafed is a substance used in the manufacture of methylamphetamine. It is restricted in the sense that, while it is available without prescription, by convention pharmacists will supply only one packet at a time to any one individual. The applicant was found to be in possession of eight packets. He was also in possession of five separate plastic bags, containing a total of 10.8 grams of amphetamines, another four resealable bags containing amphetamines, a set of electronic scales, and 10.5 tablets of LSD, valued at $210. The activities undertaken by the applicant in obtaining the Sudafed constituted the offence on the indictment; the applicant’s possession of the Sudafed tablets constituted the first of the offences on the Form 1, and his possession of the LSD tablets the second Form 1 offence. 
     
      
    4 After obtaining some Sudafed tablets from a Taree pharmacy, the applicant left in a motor vehicle driven by his wife. Police stopped the vehicle and approached the applicant, who was seated in the passenger seat. The applicant attempted to crumple some paper bags in his hands. The bags were from a number of different pharmacies. He immediately admitted that he had visited the pharmacies for the purpose of picking up Sudafed, and told police where in the vehicle the substance could be found. He also told police that there was amphetamine in the back seat of the car. 
     
      
    5 The applicant was taken to Taree Police Station, where he was interviewed. He continued to cooperate and to make admissions. He said that he was collecting the Sudafed for another person, whom he did not name. 
     
      
    6 He was to be paid $500 for his participation, together with $300 towards his expenses. The applicant remained in custody until sentenced on 8 December 2005. 
     
      
       
      Subjective circumstances 
       
      
    7 The applicant was born on 28 January 1947. He was, therefore, 58 years of age at the time of the offences. While he had some criminal history, it was relatively minor, and well in the past. His most recent previous conviction was in 1990. He was in receipt of an invalid pension. Medical evidence showed that he suffered from “multi-system disease”. His diagnosed conditions included (but were not limited to) alcoholic hepatitis, pancreatitis, hernia, bronco-pneumonia, anxiety and depression. Apparently the most significant condition was Paget’s disease, a degenerative condition of the bones. A medical report dated 10 November 2005 described him as “a definite candidate for sudden death syndrome”. The applicant had had a number of hospital admissions over the years, the most recent in April – May 2004, for leg ulcers. 
     
      
       
      The sentencing proceedings 
       
      
    8 The sentencing proceedings were brief. The applicant gave some oral evidence, principally directed to his state of ill health and the treatment he was able to obtain while in prison on remand. By that time he had been in custody for almost four months (since 15 June). He gave evidence that he was receiving little treatment for his Paget’s disease, although he seemed to accept (and the contrary was not suggested) that there is, in truth, little treatment available for that disease. It was suggested that at least he could be more adequately monitored than he had been while on remand in prison. He expressed regret for his involvement in the offences, which he characterised (realistically) as “stupid”. 
     
      
    9 In cross examination the applicant agreed that he had become involved simply for the money, and that he himself did not have, and never had had, a drug habit. 
     
      
       
      The remarks on sentence  
       
      
    10 The remarks on sentence were also relatively brief. The sentencing judge found that the plea of guilty had been entered at the earliest opportunity, and allowed a discount of 25% on sentence, in accordance with the principles stated in R v Thomson; R v Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309; 49 NSWLR 383. 
     
      
    11 His Honour found that the applicant’s role in the enterprise was as a “courier”, but also found that, notwithstanding that description, his role was “significant” and “important”. 
     
      
    12 His Honour considered that the applicant has reasonable prospects of rehabilitation. He concluded that, but for the plea of guilty, an appropriate sentence would have been of a total term of six years, and discounted that by the 25% he had foreshadowed. He found special circumstances by reason (it seems) of the applicant’s ill health, particularly the Paget’s disease, which was likely to cause deterioration, and the fact that the applicant had not previously served a prison sentence. 
     
      
       
      The application for leave to appeal against sentence 
       
      
    13 It was submitted that, in all the circumstances, the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive. On behalf of the applicant, it was put: 
     
      
    · that, properly viewed, the offence was towards the lower end of the hypothetical hierarchy of offences of its kind (as indicated by the quantity of drug involved which, relative to other instances of the offence, was not large); 
     
      
    · that the sentence indicates that the sentencing judge either overestimated the applicant’s criminality or gave insufficient weight to the medical evidence; 
     
      
    · that the applicant’s role was merely as a courier (that the applicant was a courier was expressly found by the sentencing judge; “merely” is, perhaps, not an appropriate description given the additional findings that the applicant’s role was “significant” and “important”); 
     
      
    · that the applicant cooperated with police immediately; 
     
      
    · the applicant’s effectively clear record; 
     
      
    · that the applicant was expressly found to have reasonable prospects of rehabilitation; 
     
      
    · that the applicant pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity (this was explicitly recognised in the reduction of the sentence originally considered to be appropriate); 
     
      
    · the applicant’s unusually high degree and combination of health deficits; 
     
      
    · the applicant’s evidence that he was not receiving the medical attention that he required (this, in my opinion, somewhat overstates the evidence: there was no medical evidence that the applicant was in need of any treatment that he was not receiving, and, indeed, his own evidence, to which I have already referred, suggests otherwise). Again, reference was made to the possibility of more extensive monitoring than was able to be given to the applicant while on remand; 
     
      
    · the applicant’s age (58), providing additional emphasis to his otherwise clear record. 
     
      
    14 Other than those matters to which I have appended some comment in the catalogue above, I accept that what has been put on the applicant’s behalf are all relevant sentencing considerations. However, these were all before the sentencing judge, and were, in my opinion, plainly taken into account, either explicitly or by clear implication. 
     
      
    15 I can detect no express error in the approach taken to sentencing by the sentencing judge. I am not persuaded that error can be implied by reason of the length of the sentence. In my opinion, leave to appeal should be granted, but the appeal dismissed.16 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree.17 HALL J: I also agree.18 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: Accordingly, the orders of the court are as proposed by Simpson J.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 BEAZLEY JA: I have had the advantage of reading in draft the reasons of Santow JA in this matter. I agree with his Honour’s reasons and conclusions in respect of the emails dated 10 January 2001, 16 July 2001 and 20 and 25 July 2001, which have been identified in the proceedings as the fourth, fifth and sixth matters complained of. However, I do not agree with his Honour’s conclusion in respect of the ninth matter complained of, being an undated letter written sometime in September 2001.  
     
      
    2 Santow JA has correctly identified the principle to be applied in determining whether a jury verdict may be challenged for appealable error. In short, the principle is that the jury’s verdict constituted an answer “that no reasonable jury properly instructed could have given”: John Fairfax Publications Pty Limited v Rivkin (2003) 201 ALR 77 per Gleeson CJ at [6]. 
     
      
    3 His Honour has analysed the similarities and differences between the publication constituted by the ninth matter and the earlier emails. I agree with his Honour’s analysis. It reveals that the ninth matter was different in a number of respects from the earlier publications. The ninth matter was constituted by a letter, whereas the earlier matters involved publications by email. The letter was sent to Mr John Dawson of HSBC, whereas six of the emails, including those subject of the appeal, were sent to SMEC staff, at times via distribution lists and at times via individual email addresses. None of the emails had been addressed to Mr Dawson.  
     
      
    4 There was also an important similarity: the subject matter of the letter was essentially the same as the subject matter of the emails, namely, wrongful or illegal conduct by senior personnel within SMEC and SMEC’s financial position. However, by the time that the letter was sent to Mr Dawson, there had been media coverage of the allegations, which had been broadcast on the ABC in July 2001. This allowed for the possibility that somebody other than the appellant would have been aware of the matters contained in the letter.  
     
      
    5 The question whether the appellant was the author of the ninth matter was a quintessential jury question. There were, as I have indicated, factors which pointed both ways. It was for the jury to decide whether, on the balance of probabilities, the appellant was the author of the letter. Given that there were factors that could have led to a conclusion either way, it was open to the jury to find either for or against the appellant on this issue. It found against the appellant. In my opinion, that finding was not so unreasonable that “no reasonable jury properly instructed could have given” that answer. It must be remembered that this was not a criminal trial, where the prosecution bears the onus of proving the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt. It was a civil trial. The plaintiff bears the onus in a civil trial, on the balance of probabilities, of ultimately proving the claim. However, evidentiary onuses may shift during the course of a civil trial: see Payne v Parker [1976] 1 NSWLR 191; Jones v Dunkel (1959) 101 CLR 298; see also Heydon, J D, ‘Cross on Evidence’ 7th ed, at [720].  
     
      
    6 The evidence was such that it was available to the jury to draw an inference that the appellant was the author of the document. The appellant chose not to call any evidence, leaving it to the jury to draw such inferences as were available from the whole of the evidence in relation to the authorship of each matter, including the ninth matter. As I have said, I am of the opinion that it was open to the jury to draw the inference that the appellant was the author.  
     
      
    7 The effect of finding the jury decision on the ninth matter so unreasonable that no reasonable jury could have come to that determination would effectively require a jury to determine the matter as if on the basis of the criminal onus. Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeal with costs.  
     
      
    8 Since preparing these reasons, I also have had the advantage of reading the reasons for judgment of Hodgson JA, who agrees with Santow JA except in respect of costs. As the substantive orders in the matter will be those proposed by Santow JA, it is necessary to determine the costs order that should be made in the matter. In my opinion, the order proposed by Santow JA is the costs order that should be made on the appeal.  
     
      
    9 HODGSON JA: I agree with Santow JA that the appeal should be dismissed in relation to the first eight matters, and allowed in relation to the ninth matter, and I agree substantially with his reasons for this. I would add a few comments of my own.  
     
      
    10 Sections 95, 98 and 100 of the Evidence Act 1995 provide as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        95 Use of evidence for other purposes 
         
        (1) Evidence that under this Part is not admissible to prove a particular matter must not be used to prove that matter even if it is relevant for another purpose. 
         
        (2) Evidence that under this Part cannot be used against a party to prove a particular matter must not be used against the party to prove that matter even if it is relevant for another purpose. 
         
         
        98 The coincidence rule 
         
        (1) Evidence that 2 or more related events occurred is not admissible to prove that, because of the improbability of the events occurring coincidentally, a person did a particular act or had a particular state of mind if:  
         
        (a) the party adducing the evidence has not given reasonable notice in writing to each other party of the party’s intention to adduce the evidence, or 
         
        (b) the court thinks that the evidence would not, either by itself or having regard to other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the party seeking to adduce the evidence, have significant probative value. 
         
        (2) For the purposes of subsection (1), 2 or more events are taken to be related events if and only if:  
         
        (a) they are substantially and relevantly similar, and 
         
        (b) the circumstances in which they occurred are substantially similar. 
         
        (3) Subsection (1) (a) does not apply if:  
         
        (a) the evidence is adduced in accordance with any directions made by the court under section 100, or 
         
        (b) the evidence is adduced to explain or contradict coincidence evidence adduced by another party. 
         
         
        100 Court may dispense with notice requirements 
         
        (1) The court may, on the application of a party, direct that the tendency rule is not to apply to particular tendency evidence despite the party’s failure to give notice under section 97. 
         
        (2) The court may, on the application of a party, direct that the coincidence rule is not to apply to particular coincidence evidence despite the party’s failure to give notice under section 98. 
         
        (3) The application may be made either before or after the time by which the party would, apart from this section, be required to give, or to have given, the notice. 
         
        (4) In a civil proceeding, the party’s application may be made without notice of it having been given to one or more of the other parties. 
         
        (5) The direction:  
         
        (a) is subject to such conditions (if any) as the court thinks fit, and 
         
        (b) may be given either at or before the hearing. 
         
        (6) Without limiting the court’s power to impose conditions under this section, those conditions may include one or more of the following:  
         
        (a) a condition that the party give notice of its intention to adduce the evidence to a specified party, or to each other party other than a specified party, 
         
        (b) a condition that the party give such notice only in respect of specified tendency evidence, or all tendency evidence that the party intends to adduce other than specified tendency evidence, 
         
        (c) a condition that the party give such notice only in respect of specified coincidence evidence, or all coincidence evidence that the party intends to adduce other than specified coincidence evidence. 
        
       
      
    11 In my opinion, the case against the appellant in relation to the contested publications was based on the improbability that related events occurred coincidentally, the relevant “related events” being the publications otherwise proved or admitted to have been made by the appellant, on the one hand, and the remaining publications, on the other hand. The relevant similarities are those discussed by Santow JA.  
     
      
    12 The requirement in s.98 for a notice was not relied on below or on appeal, and can be disregarded. Had the point been taken, the primary judge may well have dispensed with notice under s.100. The requirement that the evidence have “significant probative value” probably does not change the general law, which requires in any event that conclusions of fact based on similarities of events be reached by way of reasonable inference and not mere speculation.  
     
      
    13 The line between reasonable inference and speculation is sometimes difficult to draw, and is so in this case. With some hesitation, I would draw it in the same place as Santow JA. There was no evidence supporting a conclusion that were no others apart from the appellant agitating against SMEC and its executives, so that the conclusion that he published the disputed publications rested squarely on the probative value of identifiable similarities of the publications themselves. In relation to all but the ninth matter, I think the similarities were such as to support a reasonable inference.  
     
      
    14 In relation to the ninth matter, in the absence of a rational basis for concluding that the appellant was the only person agitating against SMEC and its executives, I think any similarities in the publications themselves did not take the matter beyond speculation. In my opinion, the ninth matter should not have been left to the jury. 
     
      
    15 On the question of costs, in my view the exclusion of the ninth matter is a significant result for the appellant that could substantially reduce damages. The appellant had to appeal to achieve this result; and a general principle for the award of costs is that a litigant who has to come to court to achieve a substantial result is entitled to the costs of the proceedings, although this litigant may have to pay costs to the extent that they have been increased by the inclusion of severable issues on which the litigant failed. In this case, the appellant failed in respect of most of the matters, but these matters were not entirely severable and their inclusion did not result in a proportionate increase in costs. The hearing concluded in one day. We have not been told of any offer of compromise or Calderbank letter. I would order that the respondent pay one-quarter of the appellant’s costs, and that the respondent have a certificate under the Suitors’ Fund Act. 
     
      
    16 SANTOW JA:  
     
      
      INTRODUCTION  
       
      The four respondents were the plaintiffs in a s7A trial before the primary judge, Justice Buddin, and a jury which commenced on 21 February 2005 and continued until the jury delivered its verdict on 9 March 2005. The first respondent is SMEC Holdings Limited (“SMEC”). The remaining three respondents were executive directors of SMEC at the relevant time.  
       
      
    17 The respondents at trial alleged that the appellant, Glen Boniface, had published certain anonymous emails (the first to eighth matters complained of) together with an anonymous undated typewritten letter to the HSBC (the ninth matter complained of). The first matter in fact comprised two emails sent to a Mr Bill Bultitude. Both concerned management at SMEC. Both claimed to quote from an email mistakenly received by the author. The sixth matter also comprises two emails dated 20 and 25 July 2001.  
     
      
    18 For convenience I have appended all these in the form received, as an appendix to this judgment marked Schedule A to Schedule I. They span a period from 24 November 2000 (the initial pair of emails) to September 2001 (the anonymous letter). The letter attached an actual SMEC notice to staff from the company secretary dated 29 August 2001. I shall refer to it, for convenience, as the ninth matter.  
     
      
    19 The primary judge, by a judgment dated 24 October 2005, recorded his reasons for earlier declining the application of the appellant pursuant to Pt 34 r8(2) Supreme Court Rules for judgment on the basis that “on the evidence given, judgment for the [plaintiffs] could not be supported”. The judgment sought was on the basis that the respondents could not establish that the appellant published the various communications, these being refined eventually to the fourth, fifth, sixth and ninth matters complained of.  
     
      
    20 The jury thereafter found that the appellant had published the nine matters being the eight emails and the letter. They further found that the nine matters complained of conveyed defamatory imputations of and concerning the respondents.  
     
      
    21 This appeal concerns the identity of the publisher, the appellant contending that the jury’s verdict constituted an answer “that no reasonable jury properly instructed could have given”; John Fairfax Publications Pty Limited v Rivkin (2003) 201 ALR 77 per Gleeson CJ at [6]. I shall use the shorthand expression “perverse” to describe such a verdict, intending it to connote that more detailed elaboration.  
     
      
    22 The draft Notice of Appeal had originally sought orders that the verdicts of the jury that the appellant published the matters consisting of the third, fourth, fifth and sixth emails and the ninth matter be set aside. Subsequently, the appellant altered the grounds of the appeal to remove the third email so that only four of the nine matters are pressed, namely four, five, six and nine. The appellant contends that there was no evidence fit to go to the jury that the appellant published these matters and that the verdict of the jury in finding that the appellant published these matters was “perverse” in the above sense.  
     
      
    23 The appellant, who was the defendant in the original proceedings, is a former employee of SMEC whose employment was terminated on 17 January 2001.  
     
      
    24 Indeed so far as the first and seventh matters were concerned, these are now admitted as having been sent by the appellant. As I explain, this necessarily leads to the probable conclusion that the appellant sent the second and eighth matters also; at the very least it means that the jury’s verdict could not be shown to be perverse in so concluding. Insofar as matter three is concerned, it contains a misspelling “Percivil” for “Percival”, a misspelling which is common to the second matter (as well as matter eight). Matters two and three also cover similar subject matter. The result is that matters one, two, three, seven and eight must be taken in all probability to have emanated from the appellant. The question then is whether the jury’s verdict attributing the appellant’s authorship to the remaining four matters challenged (four, five, six and nine) can be set aside as perverse.  
     
      
    25 Counsel for the appellant indicated a fall-back position. It was submitted that the ninth matter, being uniquely a letter rather than an email and having other differences relied upon by the appellant, was not the subject of sufficient evidence to go to a jury so that the appeal should succeed in relation to the ninth matter at least.  
     
      
       
      SALIENT FACTS  
      
    26 These are essentially undisputed.  
     
      
    27 The defamation complaint concerned the nine anonymous communications (the emails and the last undated letter) earlier described, sent between 24 November 2000 and September 2001. The first four emails were sent while the appellant was employed by SMEC. The remaining four emails and the letter were sent after his employment was terminated on 17 January 2001. The ninth matter was a letter addressed to Mr John Dawson of HSBC, unsigned and undated. Annexed to the letter was a Notice to staff and shareholders of SMEC written by the company secretary dated 29 August 2001.  
     
      
    28 The dates on which each of the matters were published has some significance as will emerge, and were as follows: 
     
      
      First matter: 24 and 30 November 2000  
      Second matter: 8 December 2000  
      Third matter: 19 December 2000  
      Fourth matter: 10 January 2001  
      
    29 The appellant’s employment with SMEC was then terminated on 17 January 2001. Subsequently, five further matters were published, as set out below. An ABC radio broadcast on 15 July 2001 dealt with some of the allegations in the various emails and the letter. It took place the day before the fifth matter. The transcript of the broadcast was not in evidence. The remaining matters were as follows.  
     
      
      Fifth matter: 16 July 2001  
      Sixth matter: 20 and 25 July 2001  
      Seventh matter: 3 August 2001  
      Eight matter: 15 February 2001 (Note that it is out of sequence, being the first to be published after 17 January 2001 when the appellant’s employment terminated.)  
      Ninth matter: The letter is undated but was accompanied by a Notice to Staff from the Company Secretary dated 29 August 2001. According to the primary judge it was agreed to have been written some time in September 2001; at [30].  
      
    30 There is an issue about the reason why the appellant’s services were terminated on 17 January 2001. It was the appellant’s case at trial that the reason was that, in the course of an investigation launched in December 2001 into the source of the emails, pornographic material was located upon his computer and that his employment was terminated for that reason. The appellant contends otherwise, claiming his employment was terminated to deny his father the appellant’s support as SMEC chairman, when his father’s position was under attack. The appellant’s father ceased as chairman on 25 October 2001, losing his position in acrimonious circumstances.  
     
      
    31 The second, third and fourth respondents held senior management positions at SMEC and were on its board. During the appellant’s employment, the appellant worked in an office with a computer available for his use.  
     
      
    32 The investigation was commenced on behalf of SMEC shortly after the first two emails (matters 1 and 2) appeared, these being sent from the appellant’s computer (Judgment, [17]), to ascertain who had sent them. The appellant’s computer was examined on 11 December 2000. The appellant was interviewed on 15 December 2000. He therefore knew that he was under investigation by the time the third email was sent (19 December 2000).  
     
      
    33 The examination of the appellant’s computer on 11 December 2000 identified a large number of files as having been copied from it to another computer. The appellant was an expert computer user. An expert in computer forensics gave evidence that the computer issued to the appellant had been subject to a process of defragmentation. The respondents acknowledge that they cannot identify the computer from which the email that is the subject of the third complaint was sent. Nevertheless, if the appellant had sent this email as well as the earlier ones, then it is understandable that he would not have wanted it to be traced to his computer, knowing then that he was under investigation.  
     
      
    34 As noted by the primary judge, the appellant admitted that the email the subject of the seventh matter of complaint was published by him. He had earlier denied publication in relation to all nine matters, both in answers to interrogatories and in his Statement of Defence.  
     
      
    35 The circumstances of the appellant admitting publication of the seventh matter was that on 1 August 2001 at 1.14pm the appellant was filmed by the investigator using a computer in a Gateway Computer Store to publish an email to SMEC offices in North Sydney. At the same time he also published an email in almost precisely the same terms to the then Chairman of SMEC, a Mr Scott.  
     
      
    36 However, Mr Scott had recently changed his email address and therefore the publication did not go through. In making these two publications the appellant used the “Advice Box” internet mailbox system. “Advice Box”, according to the expert evidence, is similar to Hotmail (an internet mailbox system).  
     
      
    37 Mr Henley, an independent computer forensic expert from PriceWaterhouseCoopers, gave uncontroverted evidence that access was obtained to the actual computer used by the appellant at the Gateway Computer Store, soon after 1.14 pm on 1 August 2001. Within the hard disk on that actual computer used by the appellant to publish the admitted seventh letter, the independent expert found a text which contained the eighth matter. Thus it would clearly be open to the jury to take the eighth letter as emanating also from the appellant. That in turn, with the other unchallenged communications, has implications for the authorship of the others including the four the subject of challenge, as I explain.  
     
      
    38 Also about a week before 1 August 2001, namely on 24 July 2001, the appellant was filmed going into the same Gateway Store, approaching a computer, and beginning to use it. A Gateway staff-member approached and disturbed the appellant and he backed off from the computer and walked away. That date, 24 July 2001, was between the dates of publication of the sixth matter complained of, consisting of the two emails in very similar terms dated 20 July 2001 and 25 July 2001.  
     
      
    39 There was further photographic evidence showing the appellant using the Gateway computer on 3 August 2001 to send an email which was received by Mr Busbridge; Exhibit “M”. That email was in almost identical form to the seventh matter, though not relied upon by the appellant in its Statement of Claim.  
     
      
    40 The email constituting the eighth matter was sent in February 2001. It was extracted from the same computer in the Gateway Store from which the seventh email was sent; Judgment, [16].  
     
      
       
      The primary judgment  
      
    41 The appellant, at the conclusion of the respondent’s evidence and having given none himself, moved the court pursuant to Supreme Court Rules Pt 34 r8(2) for judgment on the basis that “on the evidence given judgment for the [respondents] could not be supported”. Without formally abandoning any part of the application, the primary judge understood that counsel for the appellant (Mr Evatt) then confined his application to the fourth, fifth, sixth and ninth matters complained of.  
     
      
    42 The primary judge noted that there was no formal admission regarding the first and second matters complained of. However, the primary judge at [17]-[18] referred to the following uncontradicted evidence that the first and second emails had been sent by the appellant with some effort at concealing the source of the second. Significantly, he had earlier denied sending any of the nine communications in both interrogatories and as pleaded in his Statement of Defence:  
     
      
       
        
        “[17] It is now convenient to deal with the first matter complained of, which consists of two separate emails. It is common ground, as I understand it, that the same person sent each of those emails. Nor is it in dispute that the emails were sent from the computer which was in the office allocated to the defendant. There was also evidence available which was capable of establishing a more direct connection between the defendant and the use of that facility at the relevant time. It is unnecessary to record the fine detail of that material given the approach taken by the defendant on this application.  
        [18] In respect of the second matter complained of, an email sent on 8 December 2000, it is again not in issue that that email was also sent from the office computer used by the defendant. The account used was in the name of a Ms Coningsby and was the first use of that account. The defendant had participated in a conversation with Ms Coningsby on 6 December whilst he and a Mr Dutt were installing a computer in her home. During that conversation both he and Mr Dutt became aware of her password and log-in details. Ms Coningsby and Mr Dutt each gave uncontradicted evidence that they had not sent the email in question. There was also other powerful circumstantial evidence which pointed to the defendant having sent this email.”  
        
       
      
    43 After a comparison of the various matters of commonality between the matters complained of, the primary judge concluded that there was material available which was capable of acceptance by the jury to establish that the appellant was responsible for publishing all nine matters complained of. His Honour reasoned as follows:  
     
      
      (a) The same themes are constantly emphasised: allegations about the illegal transfer and payment of money; bribery; corruption; various criminal activities and covering up those activities, all of which being said to warrant investigation by the World Bank, ASIC and the AFP.  
      (b) There are constant references to the fact that three respondents should resign from their positions (Peter Busbridge, Ross Hitt and Geoff Percival (misspelt Percivil in the emails of matters 2, 3 and 8 but spelled correctly in 5)); Judgment, [31].  
      (c) The inference is available that the appellant had the opportunity to publish the various emails; Judgment, [32].  
      (d) The inference is available that the appellant would have been privy, perhaps through his father or someone else, to the matters raised in the communications which followed his termination; Judgment, [32].  
      (e) The inference is available that the appellant was motivated to send the first four emails by the apparent battle for positions on the board because:  
       
        
        (i) there was evidence that at least some of SMEC’s board members had become disenchanted with the management style of the appellant’s father;  
        (ii) the evidence suggested that there was a division in the upper echelons of the company about him; and  
        (iii) SMEC’s AGM was held over from November 2000 until 23 January 2001 and the first four emails were published during that period, with some of the respondents standing for re-election at that meeting and three of those four emails were sent to the shareholders of the company; Judgment, [33]. 
        
       
      (f) The inference is available that the appellant was motivated to send the five emails that followed his dismissal because he wished to continue to support his father (who remained on the board until October 2001) and because of the personal animus he felt by reason of his dismissal; Judgment, [34].  
      (g) A jury would be entitled to conclude that the present case is of the character where the probative force of circumstantial evidence becomes greater as the individual items of evidence increase: Seymour v ABC (1977) 19 NSWLR 219 per Mahoney JA at 234; Judgment, [35-36].  
      
    44 Those conclusions followed a detailed analysis of each of the matters complained of and their similarity to those effectively admitted. It is convenient to deal with that in more detail under “Disposition” below.  
     
      
       
      DISPOSITION  
      
    45 There is no dispute, as there was not at trial, on the applicable principles of law to be applied in determining whether the matter could be taken from the jury and as to the higher hurdle to satisfy the test for unreasonableness or perversity in relation to a jury verdict. On appeal, counsel for the appellant recognised that the respondents’ case was to be taken at its highest and most favourable. Also that the probative force of circumstantial evidence necessarily must become greater as the individual items of evidence point plausibly towards the fact to be proved. Thus in Seymour v ABC (1977) 19 NSWLR 219 at 234 per Mahoney JA:  
     
      
       
        
        “… the probative force of circumstantial evidence may become greater as the individual items of evidence, each pointing, as Wigmore says, plausibly or probably towards the fact probandum, increase in number”.  
        
       
      
    46 It was common round that the relevant principles are as set out in Naxakis v Western General Hospital & Anor (1998) 197 CLR 269 in particular at 274 per Gaudron J. To similar effect, I respectfully adopt what was said by Kirby J in Swain v Waverley Municipal Council (2005) 220 CLR 517 at [205]:  
     
      
       
        
        ""Where a ‘no evidence’ argument is advanced, the issue is never whether the judge concerned would draw the inferences and make the findings involved. It is not whether that judge thinks that the case made for a party is probable or improbable. It is whether, accepting to the full the evidence (or parts of the evidence) most favourable to the party concerned, as a matter of law, the jury might reasonably return a verdict on that evidence in favour of that party.” [footnotes omitted] 
        
       
       
      Again I shall use the shorthand “perverse” to describe a jury verdict that fails this test.  
       
      
    47 In Calin v Greater Union Organisation Pty Ltd (1991) 173 CLR 33 the Court (Mason CJ, Deane, Toohey and McHugh JJ) referred to the distinction made by Dixon J in Hocking v Bell (1945) 71 CLR 430 between cases which challenge a verdict based on some legal error and cases where there is conflicting evidence and the verdict is said to be against the weight of evidence. The present matters fall if at all into this second class of appeal. The Court in Calin said with respect to this type of case,  
     
      
       
        
        “the verdict is not disturbed unless the jury, viewing the whole evidence reasonably, could not properly find it…The party seeking a new trial on this ground needs an exceptionally strong case because it must be shown that ""the evidence so preponderates against the verdict as to show that it was unreasonable and unjust"" [references omitted].  
        
       
      
    48 A logical starting point is a comparison between some or all the matters complained of which were not the subject of challenge or were effectively admitted, and some or all of the matters the subject of appeal.  
     
      
    49 Though there was some reference in argument to those provisions of the Evidence Act dealing with tendency or more relevantly coincidence evidence in Pt 3.6 of the Evidence Act, it does not appear that argument at trial or on appeal was so based. I therefore do not need to consider those provisions having regard to the way the matter was argued.  
     
      
    50 It is undisputed that there was an ABC radio broadcast on 15 July 2001, that is to say just the day before the fifth matter complained of. However, the transcript of that radio broadcast was not put into evidence by any party. It appears that the radio broadcast dealt with allegations concerning SMEC and its executives, as indicated in the fifth and sixth matters. There were also, according to those matters, supposedly some investigations by the Asian Development Bank and the World Bank; Judgment at [29]. However, given that there is no precise evidence of what was said on the ABC programme, it is not possible to judge the materiality of that. That leads me to a closer comparison of the various matters admitted to the matters disputed.  
     
      
    51 A logical process, and one well open to a jury to have adopted, is to divide the email matters into two categories. In the first category are the matters the appellant had effectively conceded publishing, though after earlier denial. These were the first, second and seventh matters complained of. In the second category are the matters where authorship and publication was disputed and that dispute was maintained. These consisted initially of the third, fourth, fifth, sixth and eighth matters.  
     
      
    52 The matters within the first category can be likened to fixed points. They may properly be compared to those unadmitted matters in the second category, to see which items of that second category share sufficient characteristics in common with the first so as to permit a jury, without perversity, to reach a verdict that the two sets of items were published by the same person, being Mr Boniface. Once an item of the second category is thereby shown to have come into the first category that in turn permits fresh comparison between that item now in the first category, with those remaining items still in the disputed second category.  
     
      
       
      General similarities 
      
    53 I start with general similarities without at first separating the two categories. I do so putting to one side the ninth matter.  
     
      
      (a) All of the email matters complained of (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8) criticise Mr Peter Busbridge, at times in isolation and at times as one of a number of managerial staff responsible for illegal conduct and/or suspect or unprofessional dealings.  
      (b) Six of the email matters, including the three email matters that are subject of appeal (1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6), were sent to SMEC staff, at times via distribution lists and at times via individual email addresses.  
      (c) Six of the emails (1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8) mention and criticise Mr Ross Hitt by name.  
      (d) Five of the matters (2, 3, 4, 5 and 6) were sent using email accounts that featured “smec” in the personalised portion of the address.  
      (e) Five of the matters (1, 2, 3, 4 and 6) were sent using Hotmail email accounts.  
      (f) Five of the matters (2, 3, 5, 6 and 8) made allegations regarding illegal payments, international bribes and/or a cover-up campaign by SMEC managers. (It should be noted however that two of these emails (5 and 6) were sent after similar allegations were apparently made in the ABC radio broadcast on 15 July 2001.) The third and eighth matters complained of  
      
    54 The first, second and seventh matters were effectively admitted.  
     
      
    55 These three matters provide a strong basis for inferring that the third and eighth matters were also sent by the appellant.  
     
      
    56 The third matter was an email sent on 19 December 2000. The following characteristics link it with the admitted second matter.  
     
      
      (a) The misspelling of Geoff Percivil (rather than Percival) features in both emails.  
      (b) Both emails mention illegal outlays by SMEC managerial staff. The second matter mentions the “illegal transfer of project payments” and the third matter mentions “illegal dealings”. In both cases this conduct is attributed to the same three individuals, namely Messers Ross Hitt, Geoff Percival and Peter Busbridge, and in both cases the desirability of an ASIC investigation is mentioned.  
      (c) Both emails were sent to the same internal SMEC distribution lists known as corporate.finance@smec.com.au, everyaussite@smec.com.au and everyintproj@smec.com.au and no other addresses. These distribution lists were also used for the fifth matter and the first email of the two comprising the sixth matter.  
      (d) Both emails were sent from Hotmail accounts that featured “smec” in the personalised portion of the address, specifically smecsmallshareholder@hotmail.com for the second matter and smec_shareholders@hotmail.com for the third matter.  
      
    57 These similarities provide a basis upon which the jury could conclude without perversity that the appellant published the third matter in addition to the effectively conceded first and second matters.  
     
      
    58 The eighth matter complained of was an email sent on or about 15 February 2001. The text of the eighth matter was located on the computer at the Gateway Computer Store from whence the seventh matter was also sent by the appellant. Thus the jury could conclude without perversity that the appellant had also sent the eighth matter. 
     
      
       
      The fourth, fifth and sixth matters complained of  
      
    59 The fourth matter was the email sent on 10 January 2001. There are a number of similarities linking this email to some or all of the first, second, third, seventh and eighth matters.  
     
      
      (a) Like the second and third matters, the fourth matter was sent from a Hotmail account that featured “smec” in the personalised portion of the address. In this case the address was smec_fairy_godmother@hotmail.com. The addresses for the second and third matters were smecsmallshareholder@hotmail.com and smec_shareholders@hotmail.com respectively.  
      (b) Like the second and third matters, the fourth matter was sent to SMEC staff. The fourth matter was sent to forty separate email address, most of which were individual SMEC employees, rather than to the email lists used in the second and third matters.  
      (c) The email subject line for the fourth matter was “Small Shareholders – A Little Information for You”. “Small Shareholder” was used as the nom de plume in the second matter.  
      (d) Both the third and fourth matters were signed off with the word “love”. This is an unusual appellation.  
      
    60 These similarities provide a sufficient basis for a jury without perversity to conclude that the appellant also published the fourth matter.  
     
      
    61 On 15 July 2001 there was a ABC radio broadcast dealing with some of the same allegations made in the emails comprising matters 1, 2, 3, 4 and 8. The transcript of this broadcast was not in evidence. But if it had been, thematic consistency between the later emails might have been capable of being explained by their derivation from the broadcast, rather than from having the same publisher. Even so, the fifth and sixth matters complained of exhibit common characteristics in relation to the method and form of communication, apart from any commonality of content.  
     
      
    62 The fifth matter complained of is an email sent on 16 July 2001. With respect to the fifth matter complained of  
     
      
      (a) The fifth matter was sent to two of the three email distribution lists used in the second and third matters, namely everyaussite@smec.com.au and everyintproj@smec.com.au, and  
      (b) The fifth matter was sent using the same internet service provider (namely pacific.net.au) as was used for the third matter.  
      
    63 The sixth matter complained of consists of two identical emails sent on 20 July 2001 and 25 July 2001.  
     
      
      (a) The fourth matter and the second of the two identical emails comprising the sixth matter were sent from an internet café in Kings Cross.  
      (b) The first email comprising the sixth matter was sent using the same internet service provider as was used for the third and fifth matters.  
      (c) Like the second, third and fourth matters, both emails comprising the sixth matter were sent from a Hotmail account that featured “smec” in the personalised portion of the address; in this case the address was smec_phantom@hotmail.com.  
      (d) The first email of the sixth matter was sent to the same two SMEC distribution lists that were used in the second, third and fifth matters, namely everyaussite@smec.com.au and everyintproj@smec.com.au.  
      
    64 Examination of the circumstances reveals a pattern of thematic consistency and a substantial body of other similarities. On the basis of this pattern of similarities, I consider that it has not been shown by the appellant that the jury verdict should be set aside as perverse in accordance with these principles.  
     
      
       
      The ninth matter  
      
    65 I turn to the ninth matter complained of, a letter sent to Mr John Dawson of HSBC rather than an email. It was accompanied by a genuine company notice titled ‘Notice to all staff and shareholders of SMEC – Resignation of Chairman, Mr Peter Rehn’ and dated 29 August 2001. This letter is unsigned and undated. It was agreed between the parties that this letter was published in or around September 2001.  
     
      
    66 The ninth matter reiterates the themes that are familiar from matters 1 – 8. It was, however, produced after similar allegations were widely broadcast on the ABC program of July 2001. Consequently, this substantive similarity is much less significant than for the email matters published prior to the ABC report. There was no counterpart in the way the letter was published to the common technical features attending the publication of the emails. The emails included, for example, the use, in certain instances, of the same email distribution lists or Internet Service Provider (ISP). Identifying such technical similarities in the case of the ninth matter complained of is simply not possible. The technical hallmarks of email communications cannot be usefully compared to a letter in hard copy. Further, none of the other matters complained of were sent to Mr Dawson. On this basis no reasonable view of the evidence can justify the conclusion that the appellant published the ninth matter. On that ninth matter, I consider the jury’s verdict should be set aside. 
     
      
       
      OVERALL CONCLUSION AND ORDERS  
      
    67 I consider that this appeal should fail save for the appeal in relation to the ninth matter. I consider that costs should reflect the substantial success of the respondents on appeal and the fact that the ninth matter occupied relatively little time. I propose orders as follows:  
     
      
      (1) Appeal dismissed in relation to the first to eighth matters inclusive.  
      (2) Verdict in relation to the ninth matter to be set aside.  
      (3) Appellant to pay 95% of the costs of the respondent in the appeal.

    SENTENCE1 HIS HONOUR: Bassam Charrouf appears for sentence today on two matters appearing on separate indictments. The first matter concerns an offence committed on 11 December 2005, the second, an offence committed on 6 July 2005. In each case Mr Charrouf has pleaded guilty. He has been in custody continually since 12 December 2005.2 The offence on 11 December 2005 was committed with a number of other people. Originally Mr Charrouf stood trial with two of them, Mr Fajajo and Mr Alameddine, but part way through the trial I discharged the jury as far as Mr Charrouf was concerned. In the event the jury found Mr Alameddine and Mr Fajajo guilty and on a later occasion Mr Charrouf pleaded guilty to his involvement in that offence. However, as the entirety of the material from the trial was not necessarily admissible against Mr Charrouf, I have dealt with that matter separately from the matter of Mr Alameddine and Mr Fajajo.3 A statement of agreed facts was tendered in relation to that offence, which does not differ significantly, if at all, from the evidence called at trial. But, in any case, as I have said I will sentence him on the basis of the material put before me today, rather than the material that I heard during the trial.4 What occurred on 11 December 2005 was that Mr Gargan, who was a twenty-one year old Irish tourist in Australia on a working holiday, was walking towards his home at Kings Cross. As he got close to his apartment he saw a number of young men standing together in a group. He walked past them but sensed that they, or some of them, had begun to follow him. As he got close to his apartment block he heard a male voice behind him say, “Give me your keys”, to which he succinctly replied “Go fuck yourself”. Mr Gargan then turned around and saw two males confronting him. One of them snatched the keys from his hand and then both of them started to hit into his face, jaw and his temple with closed fists. At first Mr Gargan tried to hit back but eventually he was left in a situation where all he could do was protect himself. He placed his hands over his head accordingly. As he was doing that a third person ran up and joined the first two. Mr Gargan said that he saw three people attacking him, although I am satisfied that there were in fact four. This is because unbeknownst to both Mr Gargan and the men attacking him police were conducting a surveillance operation. They actually saw the offence being committed. They saw that one of the initial attackers was this offender, Bassam Charrouf. They saw this offender and Mr Fajajo grab Mr Gargan, push him into a small alcove and begin attacking him. The police managed to see all four people attacking Mr Gargan as he attempted to cover his head with his hands. Police intervened as quickly as they could apparently, running towards the group with firearms drawn. Bassam Charrouf ran away as the police approached and was arrested the day after.5 As a result of the attack upon him the victim lost his keys and suffered abrasions to his elbow and tenderness to his face.6 The offence which occurred earlier in time, on 6 July 2005, occurred in the following circumstances. The offender was at the home of Colin Baldwin on 6 July with a number of other people, including his brother, Mohammed Charrouf. They decided that they wanted some food and so the offender telephoned the Dominos Pizza outlet, ordered six pizzas, two garlic breads and some drinks. One of the people who was present at the time removed some money from his pocket and offered it to Bassam Charrouf as his contribution to the cost of the food. The offender replied “No, don’t worry about it, mate”, and the offender’s brother said “We’ll just jump him”. Thus, there was some planning which went into the offence which later occurred. Twenty minutes after the telephone call made by the offender he and his co-offenders left the unit and went to the address where they had asked for the pizzas to be delivered. The victim, the pizza delivery man, arrived at that address. He carried the food inside the foyer of the block of units where he was confronted with the offender and a number of other young men. He said “Okay, that’s $39.45, thanks”. What happened then was that someone knocked the food out of his hand, it was picked up by others, the offender was one of those who took the food and ran away. In fact what happened after that was that the pizza delivery man noticed that one of Mr Charrouf’s co-offenders was armed with a bat and taken from him was a mobile phone, a wrist watch, his personal wallet and fifty dollars in cash.7 The statement of facts records, and I will sentence the offender on the basis that, the offender was not a party to the production of the weapon or the theft of the personal items belonging to the victim and was not aware that the weapon was going to be produced. He is to be sentenced on the basis that he had planned only the theft of the food and drinks from the victim and had not been aware of any agreement to steal personal items from him.8 The offender was detected after some DNA analysis was conducted on partially eaten pizza crusts which police later located. The fact that the offender was identified through that means shows the remarkable progress that has been made through the use of DNA analysis to detect and identify offenders. The DNA analysis was also confirmed when the older technology of fingerprint identification was used to identify one of the offender’s fingerprints on one of the paper bags that the pizzas had been in. The offender remained at large in relation to that matter until his arrest, as I have said earlier, on 12 December 2005.9 The offender has been brought up in a loving family. He has had many opportunities in life, but he does not appear to have taken all of them. He was born on 21 May 1983 and he is thus now twenty-three years old. His parents separated when he was approximately nine years of age, and the offender remained living with his mother. He has a close relationship with both of his parents, despite their separation. He was educated at Riverwood Public School and then Narwee High School. However, he began getting into trouble a lot at high school because he was mucking up, fighting and missing school. He was suspended numerous times before finally he was expelled halfway through year ten. He then commenced an apprenticeship as a spray painter and has held various occupations. However, he has not been able to work since he sustained injuries in a motor cycle accident on 26 December 2004. He does not drink alcohol and uses drugs only occasionally.10 The motor vehicle accident that I mentioned has resulted in the offender suffering some permanent injuries, in particular he has lost his hearing in his left ear, and now suffers from problems with his memory. A psychologist’s report suggests that the head injury has not resulted in any diminishing of his IQ, but he does have problems with new learning and recent memory functioning. It is possible, says the psychologist, that there might be some further improvement in his memory difficulties, although it is likely that they will continue indefinitely.11 The offender has a criminal history which is significant because it demonstrates a continuing attitude of disobedience towards the law. There are matters on it which are of significance, for example, an offence of maliciously wounding a person with intent to inflict grievous bodily harm, for which he was sentenced to imprisonment, in the Sydney District Court. It is to be noted that this offence predated the motor vehicle collision, and so it could in no way be attributed to any consequences of the head injury he suffered. There are also offences of common assault, for which he was sentenced to imprisonment, two offences of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, again which resulted in imprisonment, and an offence back in 2001 of robbery in company. He was dealt with in the Children’s Court for that matter and put on community service. At the time of the Kings Cross offence he was on a bond for offensive behaviour and entering inclosed lands. That is a matter of significant aggravation. The offender was also on that bond at the time of the pizza offence in July 2005, again a matter of aggravation.12 Whilst dealing with matters of aggravation it is to be noted that the offence of 11 December 2005 was committed whilst the offender was in company and resulted in Mr Gargan suffering actually bodily harm. It may well be that many offences involving corporal violence result in actual bodily harm, and so I have to be careful not to double count, but there is that circumstance of aggravation, which it is appropriate to take into account.13 In relation to the offence in July 2005 I am satisfied that the pizza delivery man was vulnerable in the sense that that word is used in s 21A of the Crimes Act and that the offence involved a degree of planning. Indeed, it is apparent that the offender was planning this for some time because of the false address that he gave when he ordered the pizza in the first place.14 The pleas of guilty are to be recognised. There is a utilitarian value attached to those pleas. In the case of the Kings Cross offence the plea of guilty was quite late, it occurring after a trial had commenced in relation to that matter. I will discount that sentence by ten per cent to reflect the utilitarian value of that plea.15 In relation to the pizza matter, that plea came only after the offender was committed for trial, but it came before any trial date was set. I will discount that sentence by twenty per cent to reflect the utilitarian value of that plea.16 Mr Adler who appeared for the offender said that I should take into account that the offender was remorseful. The only evidence to suggest that came in a letter which the offender wrote addressed to me. Despite the Crown making clear its attitude towards that material, there was no evidence which could be tested by way of cross-examination to suggest that the offender was remorseful. I am not satisfied that the offender has discharged the onus of proving that he is remorseful. It is a simple matter to write what the offender wrote, but in circumstances where there is no sworn evidence to back it up and where the offender has not put himself in a position where he can be cross-examined about the genuineness of those expressions of remorse, I am not prepared to find that the offender is in fact remorseful. Nor am I prepared to find that he has good prospects of rehabilitation. As I think I said earlier, the offender has displayed a continuing attitude of disobedience towards the law and there is nothing in the material that I can see which suggests that there is any good prospect of that changing.17 The offender will do his time in custody harder than might otherwise be the case for two reasons, the first is that because of his low level intellectual functioning, as Mr Adler suggests, the offender will be less able to deal with the issues that come up whilst in custody. However, I have not placed too much weight on that given the circumstance that those with low level of intellectual functioning are vastly over-represented in custody. The offender in common with many other offenders is functioning at a lower level than many people in the population. There is however, one more important feature and that is this, the offender was attacked and stabbed whilst in custody on an earlier occasion. He will have understandable fears that that violence might be repeated. Those fears will mean that he will do his sentence harder than would otherwise be the case. 18 In each case the property taken was of relatively low monetary value, some pizza and other food in one case, and a set of keys in the other. But, the value of the property taken is the least of the concerns which victims of such offences express. The objective gravity of this offence comes from the fact that people going about their lawful occupations, or people simply heading home after a night out, are confronted by groups of young men intent on obtaining for themselves property, caring nothing for the consequences of their actions to the victim of such offences. These offences were both objectively serious. They carry with them maximum penalties of twenty years imprisonment, which indicates the concern expressed by parliament, and also the community, at the prevalence of such offences. No suggestion was made by Mr Adler that I would find special circumstances in this case. I decline to do so. 19 The sentences I impose are as follows; for the offence of 6 July 2005 the offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of two and a half years to commence on 12 December 2005 and a head sentence of four years. For the offence commenced on 11 December 2005, I set a non-parole period of two years and nine months to commence on 12 December 2006 and a head sentence of four years. The non-parole period will expire on 11 September 2009 on which day the offender is eligible to be released to parole. 20 The overall sentence is one of a non-parole period of three years and nine months, with a head sentence of five years.21 I will make a recommendation that Mr Charrouf’s medical condition be investigated in accordance with the suggestions made by Dr Pulman in her report of 5 December 2006, in particular that he undergo an MRI scan and be referred to a neurologist, and consideration be given to a review by a brain injury unit at a major hospital.

     Subject to Crown Appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal 
    SENTENCE1 HIS HONOUR: This case more clearly than many others reveals the savage consequences undisciplined drug addiction imposes upon both victim and offender. Regrettably, many members of society are addicted to drug or alcohol but they are able to exercise sufficient discipline to keep their addiction within the limits of their budget and/or the confines of their home. Where addiction triumphs over established social boundaries and taboos, what is otherwise a personal health problem becomes antisocial criminal conduct. 2 Craig John Drew is a heroin addict. In 2004 however he was able to attend weekly meetings with the Exodus Foundation Men’s Group. He was well liked and appears to have been well supported by others. In Christmas of 2004 he donated a number of Christmas presents to be given to needy children at the annual Exodus Foundation Christmas party. 3 By contrast between 11th and 13th June 2005 he was severely addicted to heroin. His sense of self discipline disintegrated between those dates, when he robbed three bus drivers and seriously wounded a fourth when attempting to rob him. The money he captured was to feed his drug addiction. 4 On the other hand Robert Baraclough and Christopher Pasquale were two bus drivers confronted by Craig Drew. Robert Baraclough now experiences a level of stress so severe that it incapacitates him. He is now unable to work as a bus driver. Craig Drew’s robbery of him was a significant event in contributing to that stress. 5 Christopher Pasquale now carries a 16 per cent impairment of his upper limb function as a result of being wounded by Craig Drew’s knife. He is depressed, has flashbacks, has gone backward financially. Both victims suffered as a consequence of the criminal offending of Craig Drew who engaged in antisocial criminal conduct in response to his drug addiction. The consequences for those men was dire. 6 Today Craig Drew must face the consequences for his criminal offending brought about by that antisocial response undertaken to satisfy his drug need. His criminal offending has been reviewed by a jury who was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that between 11 June 2005 and 13 June 2005 on three occasions, being armed with an offensive instrument, he had robbed three different bus drivers of varying sums of money in cash and also that on 13 June 2005 at Mortlake, again armed with an offensive weapon, namely a knife, had assaulted Christopher Pasquale with intent to rob him of cash and that he, at that time of that assault, wounded Christopher Pasquale.7 As sentencing judge it falls to me to resolve a number of competing tensions as I strive to determine the appropriate sentence for these offences before this Court committed by this offender, harming these victims in this community. R v Gladue [1990] 1 S.C.R. 688 at 80. My initial task requires an assessment of the objective criminality of the offences before the Court. I will also need to have regard to matters personal to the offender. The starting point for such assessments requires a sentencing judge to make findings of fact from the evidence before the Court relating to the offence and to the offender. The offender’s rehabilitation prospects will have to be assessed, even if looking through a glass darkly.8 Before any sentence can be made there are likely to be technical question relating to deterrence, discounts, whether special circumstances are to be found, whether there is a standard non-parole period attracted and, if so, the length of the parole period and finally of course the ultimate length of the term of imprisonment that is to be imposed. 9 None of those can be commenced until the primary facts are determined. That determination must be consistent with the findings made by the jury. 10 What weight needs to be given to all these matters against the imperative that all sentencing should have as it’s primary focus the protection of the community, would also need to be determined. See R v Cuthbert [1967] 2 NSWR 329; R v Rushby [1977] 1NSWLR 594 and R v Hayes [1984] 1 NSWLR 740). Facts.11 Between 11 and 13 June 2005 Craig Drew targeted four State Transit Authority buses plying routes in inner suburban Sydney, primarily inner west. Drivers having finished the outgoing journey would turn their empty buses around for the ingoing journey. The drivers would rest for a few minutes and at the appointed timetable moment would commence the ingoing journey. At an early stop the offender would board a still empty bus approaching the driver as though to deal with him. He would be dressed in a garment usually with a hooded top or be wearing a baseball cap, sunglasses and loose fitting clothing, thereby making accurate description of him difficult. In his right hand he would be armed with a knife which he produced immediately upon entry into the bus. The production of the knife was accompanied by a demand for money from the till. In the three robberies immediately upon receiving the booty, he would depart through the open front door before the driver had any chance of closing it.12 On 13th June the first attempt at robbery was unsuccessful. The offender followed his usual procedure, boarding the bus, producing the knife and making his demand. The accused moved forward to secure the money. The driver, not surprisingly, at the accused movement, became fearful, believing he may be attacked. I am satisfied that there was no intention at that point in time by the offender to attack. The driver swung the cash tray; the offender lunged forward with the knife wounding Pasquale’s outer left forearm. In the melee the offender lost his sun glasses, coins spilt on the floor, the accused sought to collect his sunglasses from the floor saying, “I’ll kill you” or words to that effect. Pasquale tried to kick the offender but did not connect. The offender decamped, running from the bus towards a rendezvous point. He left behind his glasses. 13 When Pasquale was looked at by doctors at the Concord Hospital there was evidence of complete left ulna tear nerve injury at the forearm level with weakness of the ulna inverted hand muscles and numbness of the volar and dorsal aspects of the ulna and one and half fingers of the left hand. There was a repair done under microscopic control. In June 2006 Pasquale had been assessed as having lost 40 per cent of his ulna nerve function which equates to a 16 per cent upper limb dysfunction. His prognosis is to have always some degree of loss of manual dexterity in his left hand as a result of this injury.14 The first robbery at Abbotsford yielded $180. The second at Canterbury $100, and the fourth at Abbotsford $120 or figures in that region. The attempted robbery at Mortlake yielded nothing.Objective Criminality.15 From the facts as he finds them to be sentencing judge is required to assess the objective criminality of the offences as an essential step in assessing the seriousness of the criminal behaviour of this offender. That is done by comparing objectively the criminality exhibited in all of the incident offences with criminality of offences of a similar kind. It is in this way that the seriousness of the criminality of these offences can be evaluated. The objective criminality has an important impact on the overall sentencing outcome.16 Robbery constitutes a crime against the person and against property. In this case the person having custody of the property was not it’s owner. In that sense the driver’s employer, the State Rail Authority, is also a victim. The crime against the person is constituted by putting that person in fear through threat of, or through actual violence to such a point that the person surrenders, against his will, property to a robber. In this case the offender secured advantage to his violence by presenting a 25 centimetre knife. While I suspect that the State Rail Authority has a policy requiring their drivers to surrender property without struggle in such circumstances, each of the drivers experienced fear to a point of surrendering the items anyway. The offender has demonstrated to each of his victims an intention of being ruthless by menacing each with the exposed blade of the knife. 17 Gleason J, when Chief Justice of New South Wales, encapsulated the essence of the legal wrong done by robbers and the reason why a substantial punishment is required in R v Rause, Unreported NSWCCA 8th August 1992. His Honour said,  
     
      
      “One of the primary purposes of the system of criminal justice is to keep the peace. In this connection the idea of peace embraces the freedom of ordinary citizens to walk the streets and to go about their daily affairs without fear of physical violence. It also embraces respect for the property of others. Offences of the kind committed by the present [offender] are not trivial instances of disrespect of private property, they are serious breaches of the peace. They are direct attacks upon the security of person and property which the law exists to protect”. 
      
    18 In respect of this offending conduct there are aggravating features. Each victim was vulnerable, not only because each was alone, but each was contained behind a barrier that hampered his freedom to respond. It must be obvious from the modus operandi that a degree of thought and planning had gone into the execution of each robbery. Part of that planning was to ensure that the victim was at his most vulnerable, that is, that the bus was empty. 19 The wounding of Mr Pasquale resulted in permanent impairment to him. Whilst wounding is an element of the offence a wound which causes permanent impairment must be viewed as an aggravating feature. One measure of criminality is the degree of harm caused, the greater the harm the more serious the offence. See R v Buttworth [1983] 1 NSWLR 658 at 625 1 NSWLR 658 at 625 per O’Brien CJ of Cr D. 20 In one sense the aggravating feature of a permanent wound illustrates this point but on the other hand the sums of money taken total to less than $600 on my account. The motive for the robberies was to obtain money to feed a drug addiction. While drug addiction may be a matter that can be taken into account as a subjective feature, its impact on the objective seriousness of the armed robbery offences and the attempted armed robbery offences in this case must be minimal. There is no evidence of any desperation because of a biochemical withdrawal symptoms wracking the body of the offender. The case presents as one where the offender was simply maintaining a cash flow through crime to sustain a drug habit. 21 As was said by an eminent Chief Justice in South Australia in respect of a heroin addict convicted of armed robbery in that State in a similar type of case, is accepted as and a proposition equally applicable in New South Wales,  
     
      
       
      “It must be made clear beyond misunderstanding that when a person engages in robbery while armed with a weapon, he can expect when apprehended and convicted a long sentence of imprisonment. Armed robbery is a crime which leaves little scope for leniency even when mitigating factors are present. In this case mitigating factors are few. The appellant has a criminal record, he is addicted to heroin. One feels sympathy for a person who has become entangled in drug addiction but the Courts cannot treat addiction as an excuse or even as a mitigating factor in relation to serious crime. Those who are addicted to drugs must understand that if they allow their addiction to lead them into serious crime they must expect to receive the same severe punishment as would be received by others”.  
      
    22 When his Honour spoke of mitigation there or the absence of mitigation, he was, of course, referring to the objective seriousness of the offence.Mid range of seriousness.23 An issue that needs to be determined is whether the assault with intent to rob with wounding is an offence that falls within the mid range of seriousness for offences captured by Item 11 in the table in Division 1A Standard Non-Parole Periods of Part 4 sentencing procedures for imprisonment contained in the Crimes (Sentencing Proceedings) Act 1989. 24 In the normal course of events, “attempts” do not qualify for standard non-parole periods. However in the instance which this offence may constitute an attempted armed robbery it has clear cut choate elements, in particular, (a) assault, (b) being armed and (c) wounding. True, at the time of the assault there must have been an attempt to rob or at least an intention so to do, but the assault and the wounding are choate criminal acts. This offence is one specifically created by s 98 and therefore one properly falling within a class of offences captured by Item 11 in the Table in Division 1A. 25 In assessing the objective seriousness of the offence for the purpose of considering whether it reaches a mid-range of seriousness I have had regard to it as though it stood alone. I paid no regard to it’s position in the sequence of offending conduct. I note s 98 applies to both dangerous weapons and to offensive instruments (see definition “offensive instruments”). Generally speaking a knife, lethal though it may be, will be regarded as attaching less criminality to an offence than the use of a dangerous or prohibited weapon. That is because of the potentiality for dangerous or prohibited weapons in the hands of criminals to create greater carnage. It is also of significance that the intended robbery was not consummated. The criminality of the wounding accompanied by the intended loss of property must be a greater offence than the criminality of the same order but where the robbery is completed. 26 The aggravating features - planning, the seriousness of the wound and the vulnerability of the victim, alone and trapped behind the barrier, certainly elevate the seriousness of the offending. The wounding occurred in circumstances where the victim initially moved. I am satisfied the offender did not intend to wound the victim until such time as the victim moved. I am satisfied thereafter that the movement of the knife was an intentional response and therefore criminal. However, the injury was not coldly gratuitous. There was only one victim put at risk. 27 The law regards drivers of public vehicles as being vulnerable and requiring the protection of the sentencing courts by the application of specific deterrence for like-minded would be offenders.28 Not without hesitation have I determined this offence falls below the mid range of seriousness. I do regard it as approaching a mid range. The objective criminality of each of these offences is of sufficient seriousness to warrant a substantial full time custodial sentence.Victim Impact Statements.29 I have received three victim impact statements from three of the drivers. The material contained in each of the victim impact statements is not sworn evidence and has not been subject to cross-examination. To the extent that any opinions are expressed in the statement, I recognised those opinions are not of a qualified expert. The victim impact statement coming as it does from each of the primary victims may, if I accept it as reliable, provide unsworn evidence as to the facts of the offences and their effect upon each. 30 The function of statements such as these is firstly to give to the victims the opportunity of being heard in sentence proceedings by publicly identifying the impact of the trauma visited upon them by the actions of an offender.31 Secondly it enables the sentencing proceedings to assist victims as they move to some closure of grief, resentment and brooding arising from the criminal conduct of an offender.32 Thirdly, the victim impact statement contributes to an offender, at least hearing at first hand and perhaps gaining an insight into the impact his offending conduct had upon each of his victims.34 Finally the victim impact statement ensures that the Court has a continuing consciousness of the impact violent crime has upon those ordinary men and women who are it’s victims. As such, a victim impact statement plays an important part in the administration of criminal justice. Robert Baraclough writes this:  
     
      
      “Severe trauma, stress, weeks off work, anxiety, real difficulty sleeping, wary to venture out of doors after dark, now have a doctor monitoring me, had to eventually resign from job due to this abuse and real fear for my personal safety. Scared now of strangers”.  
      
    35 There is attached a special report which might shed some insight actually into the life of a bus driver. It is a report from his doctor. It also indicates that this is not the only offence that has impacted upon him. The doctor says that he has been treating Robert Baraclough who is 62 years of age for about two and half years. The doctor says he has been slowly deteriorating in his work and has had several very stressful things happened which brought back symptoms of an old illness. 36 On 12 June 2005, that is the offence with which I am dealing, he was held up with a knife while working and robbed at Canterbury. Two months later he was punched in the face by a passenger while working at Rockdale and on 4th May this year he was threatened with a gun at Campsie. He says he has also been under frequent verbal abuse which he says all bus drivers get. As a result of all of that, but adding as I said earlier, the contribution of this offence, he is now severely incapacitated and unable to work further. He has been certified as permanently medically unfit to work.37. Mr Prasad says this:  
     
      
      “The week that the incident happened to him, [and the offence against him was on 11th June, in that week on the Saturday which was 17th June], he was expected to sit for an examination towards a graduate certificate in Human Resources Management at Meadowbank TAFE. As a consequence of the incident he became extremely tensed, was unable to think and as a result failed his examination paper. It was the only one of four that he did that he failed. The incident happened at night so he is still afraid to go anywhere alone at night. He deferred his studies and hoped to continue this year. When he went this year the course was no longer offered at Meadowbank TAFE and he has to go to Ultimo, but even worse the fees had gone up from eight hundred and something dollars to $3800. Tied in with that course was his ambitions to apply for management graduate scheme which was offered by his employers. Now he sees he has to stagnate as a bus driver”. 
      
    38 The victim who was wounded, Mr Pasquale, speaks of pain and suffering from the injury, after surgery having to wear a sling all the time, even having to sleep with his arm elevated for a month, his hand remained in plaster for several months, then came physio three times a week for a year, even yet he still experiences shooting pains, numbness, weakness in his left hand. He knows now, because he has been told by doctors, that he will never be fully recovered. He experiences flashbacks, fear of another assault and he fears suspicious looking passengers when people climb on to his bus. Financially he lost penalties for nine months, that left him in debt and he had to catch up when he worked again. The injury left him so handicapped he could not tie his shoelaces or cut meat when he was eating at the table. He was unable to drive his mother around for several months because his vehicle was manual. He and his wife enjoy dancing, that had to be put on hold and he says that the assault had an impact on his whole family because his wife and children fear it will happen again. Financially he has been put back several years, he knows he is not going to make a full physical recovery, he is afraid that there may be need for future surgery and he is particularly afraid of doing the Mortlake bus route.Subjective matters.39 I turn now to the subjective matters. I am both entitled and required to do that. Not only am I sentencing for the criminal offences but I am also sentencing this offender for them. Each offender coming before the Court varies from other offenders who stand or have stood for sentence. Circumstances personal to the offender may offer to the Court some explanation and insight into the commission of this offence by this particular offender or some reason why a more or a less severe sentencing outcome is appropriate. Social background and dynamics.40 Craig Drew is 42 years old. He is the older of two children. His mother to whom he was close, died of cancer when he was aged 12. His father dealt with the grief by immersing himself in work with two or three jobs at a time. Craig Drew feels an absence of being nurtured once his mother had passed on. He has never married although he had a girlfriend who overdosed on heroin. He was in a relationship for eight years but that ended in June 2005 because he was in custody on these matters. He claims now to be close to his father. Probation and Parole could not verify that claim; nor is there anything before the Court supporting it. Education, skill and work experience.41 Drew left school in year 10 then aged 16. He struggled with his grades although he claims literacy. Until his mother died he had performed reasonably well but lost motivation once she had passed away. During his custody he has returned to education. He gained a forklift licence and completed a basic computer course. There is a certificate from TAFE attesting an interest in, and completion, of a portion of a clothing production course during 2005, passing four units of that certificate. Aged 16 he commenced his working career as a storeman and packer. At 17 he was a station assistant for State Rail. At 19 he was a truckies offsider. He was then a truck driver off and on for 15 years. Since his mid-thirties he has not worked much, some casual cleaning work and some work as a storeman. At the time of his arrest on the present matters his income stream came from the Newstart allowance Health issues - physical.42 He reports a soft tissue injury to his back, there is also some residual impairment from an old knee injury. He presents as overweight which did not appear to be the situation at the time of the robberies. Mental health issues.43 He did not cope well with his mother’s death. He feels there are still grieving issues to be resolved for him. He may also feel some sense of abandonment as a result of his father’s workaholic practices. John W Taylor, a forensic psychologist, diagnoses him as moderately depressed with feelings of failure, sadness and pessimism as to the future. He has sought help for his depression both inside and outside gaol. There are impulse control issues in that there appears to be a diminished capacity to regulate affect, impulse and conflict. There is an above average predisposition for substance abuse. He returned to drug using upon his release in 2003. That would appear to witness his vulnerability to drugs.Poly drug abuse.44 For 15 years starting in his early twenties he was a constant user of cannabis. Prior to 35 he did not use heroin but he has become an addict since then. He speaks of heroin numbing the pain and helping him to relax. He concedes that he was abusing heroin at the time of these offences. To his credit he has attended detox on some seven occasions, each time however he has returned to heroin use within a couple of weeks.Character and antecedents.45 Prior to his heroin addiction Craig Drew possessed a good work ethic. If one accepts 35 being the age when he became addicted he only has one Children’s Court matter, 1982 stealing, and a series of driving offences in November 1999 on his record. Thereafter when his response to his addiction problems became antisocial criminal behaviour, his record deteriorated dramatically. In March 2001 he was dealt with for two armed robberies that occurred in October 2000 and January 2001. There were also charges of demand money with menaces, using an offensive weapon to prevent his apprehension, and two counts of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. He appears to have received concurrent sentences for all of these matters that ran with concurrent sentences he had received for the robberies. The overall sentence appears to have been one of four years with, as best I can determine, a non-parole period of two and half years. His parole was completed in early 2005. This offending does not constitute any breach of his parole. At the outset of these remarks I referred to the good work he had done with the Exodus Foundation Contrition.46 There is nothing in the material before me suggesting any insight into, or contrition for these offences. His case was that he was not the robber and had nothing to be contrite about or display insight into. It is certain from observing him that he is not contrite and feels no need to suggest he has any insight into anything related to these robberies. Strangely, there is a psychometric assessment prepared by John W Taylor, Psychologist, three months before the trial. It was said to have been prepared “in relation to his present legal proceedings”. I am aware there are other proceedings before his Honour Charteris DCJ. Whether there was a trial in that matter or not I am unsure, although I thought there was. Interestingly the report makes no reference to the offender’s attitude to the offence or offences before me or Charteris DCJ. In those circumstances I am reluctant to accept the validity of the testing for recidivism conducted by Mr Taylor. I note the offender scores three for his criminal history, said to be an elevated score. But what criminal history did Mr Taylor take into account. Did it include the matters before me or the matter before his Judge Charteris. Rehabilitation prospects.47 This offender’s rehabilitation prospects must be regarded as guarded. There are several factors warranting such a prognosis: 
     
     Apparent lack of contrition and insight; 
     Repetitive offending conduct in June 2005; 
     Repetitive criminal behaviour since 2001. To the extent that the recent past behaviour can be said to be indicative of future behaviour, the position does not look good; 
     The offender must now spend considerable time in an environment that is counter indicated for rehabilitation; 
     He has an entrenched heroin addiction problem coupled with antisocial criminal offending response to it; 
     Several failed attempts at rehabilitation, particularly in respect of drugs; 
     A general absence of strong family or friend network for personal support; 
     Impaired impulse control revealed in psychometric testing. 
    48 On the other hand the picture is not entire gloomy, there are some positive indicators: 
     
     Late onset of criminal offending, aged 35 before his first serious conviction; 
     Some psychometric testing suggests a low to moderate risk of recidivism although as I noted earlier, criminal tendencies and conduct problems appear to cloud that diagnosis; 
     Good use of community based resources after his last release from gaol, particularly the Exodus Foundation and the Community Restorative Centre; 
     Some serious attempt to return to education and obtain skills; 
     A history of seven attempts at detoxification indicating at least a desire to do something about his drug addiction; 
     There is a reasonable history of employment until aged 35. 
    49 While there are important positives the best that can be said at this stage for the offender is that his prospects are guarded.Setting the sentence.Deterrence.50 In modern Australian society there is a very extensive raft of criminal laws passed by the Federal and State Parliaments. The chief purpose of the criminal law put in place by Parliaments is to deter those who would breach the criminal provisions. Parliament does that by prescribing maximum penalties for offences for those who engage in conduct prohibited by the criminal law. Consequently when a person is sentenced for a breach of the criminal law, he or she is exposed to the possible maximum penalty provided by the statute breached. In the case of the assault with intent to rob with wounding and the offensive weapon, Parliament also puts in place a standard non-parole period of seven years. 51 Sentencing for breaches of the criminal law requires a sentencing judge to keep in mind those general deterrence aims of the criminal law for the community at large by keeping in mind the maximum penalties available, the standard non-parole period and their deterrent purpose. There is also a specific deterrence aimed at individuals likeminded to the offender, who but for such deterrence would be willing to commit crimes similar to those for which this offender is being punished.52 Finally, there is a component of deterrence to be considered personal to the offender with a view to deterring him or her from re-offending. In this case I have taken the view that each of those forms of deterrence needs some waiting in the outcome of this matter. The maximum penalty for each of the robberies is 20 years. The maximum penalty for the assault with intent to rob, plus wounding, and the use of an offensive weapon carries a maximum penalty of 25 years. As I said but a minute ago, the standard non-parole period for that is seven years.Impact of guideline judgment.53 This is a matter in which the guideline judgement of the R v Henry has some application. Spelt out in that case is an indicia of what one might expect in the common case of robbery. Indicia in this case does not compare favourably to the three of the eight criteria set out in Henry’s case. Namely;  
     
      
      i. In  
      Henry’s  
      case, young offender with little or no criminal history.  
       
      In this case the position is different on both scores;  
       
      ii. Limited degree of planning.  
      
    Again the planning here was carefully done and became, in fact, a modus operandi;  iii. Plea of guilty in Henry’s case against a strong Crown case, In this case there was no plea of guilty.I have dealt with planning, age of the offender and the question of his criminal history. 54 As for the absence of a plea of guilty, the law has always recognised that a plea of guilty acts to mitigate penalty. No such mitigation is present in this case. The offender is, of course, not to be punished for running his trial. His situation is he simply does not get the benefit of any discount for a plea of guilty, such as was envisaged in the Henry guideline judgment.Sentences concurrent and cumulative.55 In this case it is important that the assault with intent to rob plus wounding be recognised as the most serious of the offences with which I am dealing. That recognition is achieved by partly accumulating the sentence for that offence to the other three sentences. In respect of the three remaining offences of robbery the criminality associated with each is identical. The sentences for these three will be inflated to the degree that is necessary to take into account the question of totality of criminality as among those three. The question of totality as among the four is taken into account by the point at which accumulation commences. Mandatory non-parole period.56 In my analysis of the objective features of the third count in the indictment I found that upon the objective features alone the case did not reach a position where it could be said to be within the mid range of seriousness. There is nothing in the subjective features which elevates the offence to that threshold. This is not therefore an offence that attracts the standard non-parole period. However, while I note that the offence will not attract a standard non-parole period, I must nonetheless regard the standard non-parole as a benchmark. It is, of course, a non-parole period that applies to offences that are more serious than the offence that I am dealing with. Consequently it will drive upwards sentences and non-parole periods that do not reach that mark. I have noted that this offence falls slightly below a mid range of seriousness and consequently the non-parole period that I set must have some regard to that standard non-parole period. Special circumstances.57 This is a case in which special circumstances are appropriate for the third count, that is the assault with intent to rob count. The reasons include the age of the offender, at 42, he will be older than most offenders in custody and to some extent thereby isolated. By the time he will be eligible for release he will be approaching 45. At that age he will need an extended time resettling into the community. He has serious drug addiction issues. Frankly these are better resolved in the community than in the hothouse of a gaol culture where the prevailing ethos among prisoners is counterproductive to drug rehabilitation. If he is to return to the workforce and hopefully that would be something he would entertain, he will need the assistance appropriate to one who has been unemployed for a long term. Custodial history.58 The offender has been in custody since his arrest on 18 June 2005 therefore the sentences that I am imposing will commence from that date.59 Craig John Drew, I convict you of these three offences, that on 11 January 2005 at Abbotsford being armed with an offensive weapon you robbed Sugundra Prasad of $183 in cash, the property of Sydney Buses State Transit Authority and Sugundra Prasad. You are likewise convicted that you on 12th June, that is the following day at Canterbury, whilst you were armed with an offensive instrument, namely a knife, robbed Robert Baraclough of something in the order of $100 in cash, that was likewise the property of the State Transit Authority and that on the following day at Abbotsford, again being armed with an offensive weapon, namely a knife, you robbed John Zhang of about $120 in cash that was again the property of the State Transit Authority.60 You are sentenced for each to a non-parole period of three years to date from 18 June 2005 and to expire on 17 June 2008. There will be for that an additional term of one year to expire on 17 June 2009. 61 Mr Drew I also convict you of the offence that at Mortlake on 13 June when you were armed with an offensive weapon, that is a knife, you assaulted Christopher Pasquale with the intention of robbing him of cash and that at that time you wounded him. You are sentenced to that offence for a non-parole period of four years to date from 18 June 2006 and to expire on 17 June 2010. I set an additional term of two years to expire on 17 June 2011. 62 I note that because you have been sentenced to a minimum of more than three years you will not automatically be given parole but you will have to earn it. The Serious Offenders Review Council is the body that will determine your parole. They will take into account the way in which you behave yourself whilst you are in prison, what happens in respect of your drug addiction and what happens in terms of your prospects of re-offending before they release you into the community. The earliest date upon which you can be released is 17 June 2010.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: The appellant appeals against his conviction and seeks leave to appeal his sentence in relation to three counts: 
     
      
       
      Count 1: 
       
      That he on or about 24 July 2004, at Gordon in the State of New South Wales incited CED, being a person under ten years, namely seven years and who was under the authority of RC to commit an act of indecency with RC.  
       
       
      Count 2: 
       
      That he on or about 24 July 2004, at Gordon in the State of New South Wales did have sexual intercourse with CED a person then under the age of ten years, namely seven years. 
       
       
      Count 3: 
       
      That he on or about 24 July 2004, at Gordon in the State of New South Wales did have sexual intercourse with CED, a person under the age of ten years, namely seven years. 
       
      
    2 The appellant was sentenced on 12 August 2005 as follows: 
     
      
       
      Count 1: 
       
      Imprisonment for eighteen months to commence on 3 June 2005 and to expire on 2 December 2006. In relation to this count the sentencing judge declined to set a non-parole period because the sentence of imprisonment was to be served concurrently with terms of imprisonment with longer non-parole periods. 
       
       
      Counts 2 and 3: 
      
    3 Imprisonment for six years and six months to commence on 3 June 2005 and to expire on 2 December 2011 with a non-parole period of 4½ years commencing on 3 June 2005 and expiring on 2 December 2009. 
     
      
       
      The Crown case in summary 
       
      
    4 The Crown case was that on Friday 23 July 2004 the complainant, a seven year old girl, slept over at the house of her best friend LC. The appellant is LC’s father. The complainant and LC initially went to sleep in LC’s bedroom. At some point in the evening LC woke up and went to her father in his bedroom. He slept alone having separated from his wife who slept in another room in the house. 
     
      
    5 The Crown alleged that the complainant followed LC into the appellant’s bedroom where the appellant told the girls to play with his penis. The appellant then put hand lotion on both the complainant’s and LC’s hands and both girls touched his penis. Both girls then washed their hands in the bathroom, before returning to the appellant’s bedroom. When the complainant and LC got back into the appellant’s bed the appellant allegedly grabbed the complainant, pulled her pants down and inserted his fingers into her vagina. The appellant then lay on top of the complainant and put his penis into her vagina. 
     
      
    6 The appellant told the complainant that he loved her and gave her and LC treats that were kept in a cupboard in his bedroom. The appellant, LC and the complainant slept the remainder of the night in the appellant’s bed. The following morning the appellant told the complainant not to tell anyone what had happened the night before or he could go to gaol. 
     
      
    7 The complainant did not immediately report the events to an adult. However, on 22 August 2004 she told a family friend, DY, about the events of the 23 July. She was interviewed for the first time by the police on 27 August 2004. On 28 August 2004 she told her mother and father about what had happened. 
     
      
       
      The complaint evidence 
       
      
    8 Three witnesses gave evidence of the complainant’s report of the events. DY gave evidence that she was driving to the St Ives showground when the complainant made remarks to LC which alerted her and she asked the complainant what the secret was that they were discussing. The complainant responded: 
     
      
       
        
        “When I sleep over, [the appellant] makes me put cream on his wee wee and if I do it good, then he gives me lollies.” 
        
       
      
    9 In her evidence DY said that after this conversation she told the children about a doctors and nurses story. However, when cross-examined she agreed that she had told the police that she had told the children a doctors and nurses story before she heard of the complaint. The inconsistency was emphasised by the appellant in an attack on the reliability of DY’s account. It was also submitted that it was evidence of suggestion made by DY which initiated the complaint. 
     
      
    10 On 28 August 2004 the complainant’s father spoke to her and asked: 
     
      
       
        
        “[the appellant] did something to you can you tell me what it was?” 
        
       
      
    11 The complainant said: 
     
      
       
        
        “He put his willy in me.” He said ‘We heard about some cream. What happened there?’  
        
       
      
    12 The complainant responded: 
     
      
       
        
        “[the appellant] got LC and me to put cream on his willy first, then he grabbed me and said ‘get it in, get it in.’ I screamed a bit and he said ‘be quiet’ and he kept putting his willy in me”. 
        
       
      
    13 The complainant’s mother gave evidence that she spoke to the complainant on the same day and the complainant said to her: 
     
      
       
        
        I wish I didn’t go into to [the appellant’s] room and I could rewind the tape so I never went into his room.” 
        
       
      
    14 She also said that the complainant said: 
     
      
       
        
        “[the appellant] put his willy into my private parts and it really hurt. I screamed a lot but was told to be quiet because J might wake up. She said [the appellant] kept saying to me ‘let him in, let him in’ I wanted to get away but I couldn’t.” 
        
       
      
    15 The complainant said that LC was screaming at the appellant to “move his fat arse off C” and banging on his back with her fists. The complainant’s mother asked her “how long did it go on for?” She said: “About ten minutes and it really hurt.” The complainant said: “at the end, [the appellant] gave me an LCM and a roll-up. She said that [the appellant] said to her that he really, really loved her and that is why he did it.” 
     
      
       
      The evidence of the appellant’s daughter - LC 
       
      
    16 LC gave evidence in which she denied sexual misconduct on behalf of her father. She was first questioned by the police on 27 August 2004 and again on 2 September 2004. The interview she gave on the first occasion was generally exculpatory of any sexual impropriety on behalf of the appellant. She told the police that the “[the complainant] pulled down my Dad’s pants and touched his penis and she made me touch it.” During the interview she made no mention of any other activity. 
     
      
    17 In her second interview LC corroborated aspects of the complainant’s account of the relevant events. This was, of course, contrary to the material in her first statement. 
     
      
    18 When she gave evidence LC said that she had lied in the second record of interview because the complainant had told her that if she did not say what the complainant wanted the complainant would tell the school about what had happened. The Crown submitted that the jury might reject LC’s explanation for her earlier lies because, in particular, when challenged she could not recount when or where the complainant told her she would tell the school if she did not change her evidence. 
     
      
    19 When giving evidence LC said that she and the complainant had put cream on her father’s penis but that this was the complainant’s idea. When her father woke up he told them to “stop,” she said that the complainant said “well LC sexed B” to which her father said “we all make mistakes”. LC said that she started to cry because of what the complainant had said and agreed they were given sweets.  
     
      
    20 In neither of her interviews did LC give an account of observing events in the nature of digital or penile penetration. 
     
      
       
      The defence case 
       
      
    21 The appellant gave evidence. He denied the complainant’s account and said that he was asleep when the girls entered his room and awoke to find them massaging his penis with lotion. He was shocked and told them to stop and rolled out of bed. In doing so he went over the top of the complainant. He said that he told them that they ought not to have done what they did and the complainant said something along the lines of “well LC sexed B.” The appellant said that he was told by his daughter that the activity was the complainant’s idea. 
     
      
    22 The appellant gave evidence that he had an erectile dysfunction, low libido and a back condition which made the allegation against him impossible as he was unable to do push ups on the top of the complainant in the manner she alleged. 
     
      
       
      The evidence of JC 
       
      
    23 JC, the appellant’s wife was called in the defence case. She gave evidence that she had separated from the appellant in about 2000 but they continued to live together under the one roof with their two children. She said that the complainant had slept at their house at various times over several years. JC said that she was present on the night of the alleged incident but did not hear anything consistent with the complainant’s account. In giving evidence of the layout of the house she said that it echoed a lot because of the wooden floor boards and that she was a relatively light sleeper. She said that she did not hear the complainant scream out. She also gave evidence that the complainant had spent a night at their home after the alleged incident and that she had joined the family that night at a restaurant while celebrating their son’s birthday. 
     
      
    24 Defence counsel sought to elicit from JC whether she had read either of the police statements that her daughter had given. The Crown objected to the question and it was withdrawn. However, JC said that she spoke with her daughter after the appellant was arrested and said (using C to symbolise the complainant): 
     
      
       
        
        “She told me that she’d had a nightmare, she went into dad’s bedroom, she told me that C followed her, she wanted to go to sleep, C didn’t want to sleep, so she got up and pulled [the appellant’s] pants down, got the hand lotion, put her hand on R’s penis and then placed L’s hand on [the appellant’s] penis, then apparently Dad woke up, Dad asked ‘who’s responsible for this? LC said ‘C’ and C apparently said ‘but LC had sex with B.’ Then apparently dad was very upset, so he told them to stay in this room, do not go anywhere and go to sleep, and apparently C asked for some treats, which he gave them, and he left the room and the girls went to sleep.” 
        
       
      
    25 JC also gave evidence that some time after LC had changed schools LC had told her that she had given a different account to the police but that she had only done this because the complainant had threatened to tell everyone at school what had happened. JC also gave evidence of the appellant’s bad back and how it impacted upon his mobility. She gave evidence of conversations with the family doctor which were consistent with the appellant having problems with erectile function. 
     
      
    26 The Crown cross-examined JC and attacked her credibility. A central element of the attack was based on the circumstance that she had not told the police that she was aware that the complainant had lied in her second interview and only revealed that knowledge when she gave evidence. JC said that, amongst other reasons, she had not told the police because they had warned her not to talk to her daughter about her evidence and she was afraid of any repercussions. The following exchange occurred: 
     
      
       
        
        “Crown Prosecutor: Q. You didn’t tell the police that your daughter, an important witness in this case had changed her evidence. Is that correct? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And is that because you didn’t think that was important? 
         
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. In fact, Mrs C, it’s because you knew that what she told the police the first time on [sic] her interview in 2 September was correct. Is that not right? 
         
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Her Honour: I’m sorry, can you put that question again, Madam Crown? 
        
       
       
        
        Crown Prosecutor: I will, your Honour. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. The reason you didn’t tell the police that your daughter was going to change her story is because you knew she told the truth the first time to the police? 
         
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Her Honour: Which one? 
        
       
       
        
        Crown Prosecutor: I’ll try again, your Honour. 
        
       
       
        
        Her Honour: That’s why I asked you to ask the question again Madam Crown. 
        
       
       
        
        Crown Prosecutor: The reason, Mrs C and I think you know where I’m going with this -- 
        
       
       
        
        Greenhill: I object to that comment. 
        
       
       
        
        Her Honour: Madame Crown stop making comments to the witness. 
        
       
       
        
        Crown: Yes your Honour. 
        
       
       
        
        Her Honour: Ask questions and stop making comments. 
        
       
       
        
        Crown Prosecutor: The reason that you didn’t tell the police that your daughter was going to change her evidence is because you knew that when she gave her interview to the police on 2 September she told the truth? 
         
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. It wasn’t true, what you said yesterday, that you knew nothing about the matter is it. 
         
        A. I don’t understand. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. When you told Mr Greenhill that you didn’t want to give a statement to police because you knew nothing -- 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. -- about this matter, that wasn’t right, was it? 
         
        A. I didn’t know anything about the incident. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. But you did know that your daughter was going to change her testimony? 
         
        A. I didn’t know. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Well you knew - 
         
        A. Well - 
        
       
       
        
        Q. -- that she was – she had told you -- 
         
        A. I told my daughter to tell the truth. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You also know that she had told the police something else? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. But you didn’t think that was sufficiently important to tell the police, is that right? 
         
        A. I was frightened to tell the police. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Frightened to tell the police about the truth, is that right? 
         
        A. I was frightened to tell the police because they had told me – LM had told me on three separate occasions if I was to influence L to change her statement I could be charged with witness tampering, my children taken away from mum, and that they hadn’t yet finished laying charges against L – against R about L. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Mrs C, didn’t you think it was important that the police know that L is going to change her evidence in this serious court case? 
         
        A. I sought legal advice.” 
        
       
       
      Grounds of appeal 
       
      
    27 There are four grounds of appeal. 
     
      
       
      Ground 1: the trial miscarried because of the failure to deal properly with the evidence of the complainant by particularly: 
       
      (a) allowing the transcript and the video of the complainant’s evidence to go into the jury room; 
       
       
      (b) the failure on the part of the trial judge to give a warning and directions with respect to not giving the evidence of the complainant’s video taped interview disproportionate weight at such time as they were invited to listen to it again. 
       
       
      Ground 1(a) 
      
    28 The complainant’s evidence-in-chief consisted largely of the video of her interview with the police which was played to the jury. It was then tendered without objection. The video was provided to the jury and both the video and the transcript of it went into the jury room when they retired to consider their verdict. 
     
      
    29 Apart from the video evidence the complainant gave additional oral evidence-in-chief and was cross-examined utilising closed circuit television (CCTV) pursuant to the relevant provisions of the Evidence (Children) Act 1997 (“the Act”). 
     
      
    30 The appellant submitted that the trial judge erred in allowing the transcript and recording to go into the jury room. It was submitted that the preferred procedure set out in R v NZ (2005) 63 NSWLR 628 in the joint judgment of Howie and Johnson JJ (at [210]), was not followed. This, of course, is not surprising for the trial commenced on 13 May 2005 and concluded on 10 June 2005. The judgment in NZ was not delivered until 17 August 2005. 
     
      
    31 Section 15A of the Act provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “The court may order that a transcript be supplied to the court or, if there is a jury, to the jury, or both, of all or part of the evidence of a previous representation to which this Part applies made by a child that is given in the form of a recording if it appears to the court that a transcript would be likely to aid its or the jury’s comprehension of the evidence.” 
        
       
      
    32 The appellant’s trial counsel objected to the transcript being provided to the jury and submitted that there was a risk of it being given undue weight. However, the trial judge allowed it only as an aide-memoire and directed the jury in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “The transcript is being provided to you as an aide-memoir. It is not the evidence. The evidence is the video that you’re about to see and hear, and that will be the evidence that you should turn to in determining what you find proved in this trial. The transcript is there as an aide-memoire to assist you understand the video as it is being played to you.” 
        
       
      
    33 This direction was appropriate. The jury were clearly told that the transcript was not the evidence which was contained in the video. This ground of appeal is not made out. 
     
      
    34 No objection was taken by trial counsel to the tender of the complainant’s recorded interview and its provision to the jury and accordingly r 4 applies. 
     
      
    35 In Wilson v R [2006] NSWCCA 217 Latham J at [78] emphasised that notwithstanding the fact that this Court has indicated that video tape evidence should not be sent with the exhibits to the jury on retirement, if this occurs it “does not necessarily resolve the question whether an irregularity in the conduct of the trial has occurred, such that the verdict of the jury must be set aside. The question that arises, where the preferred procedure has not been adopted, is whether there has been a miscarriage of justice.” 
     
      
    36 It is accepted by the appellant that as in NZ the recording in the present case reveals an unemotional and unremarkable account of the complainant’s allegations. Furthermore, it is not unimportant that the jury retired to consider its verdict at 2.40 pm and returned on the same day with guilty verdicts at 3.44 pm. The interview with the complainant ran for 44 minutes. Other tapes of the interview with the appellant’s daughter ran in relation to the first interview as edited 20 minutes and the second, as edited, ran for 59 minutes. It is accordingly, impossible for the jury to have played all 3 recordings and in practical terms inconceivable that they viewed the whole of the complainant’s interview and unlikely that they viewed any part of it. 
     
      
    37 In the circumstances, although the procedure subsequently provided by this Court was not followed, I am not persuaded that a miscarriage of justice has occurred. I would refuse leave to raise this matter. 
     
      
       
      Ground 1(b) 
      
    38 When evidence is given by playing the video of a recorded interview s 14 of the Act provides as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “Warning to Jury 
        
       
       
        
        If a child gives evidence of a previous representation wholly or partly in the form of a recording made by an investigating official in accordance with this Part in any proceedings in which there is a jury, the judge must warn the jury not to draw any inference adverse to the accused person or give the evidence any greater or lesser weight because of the evidence being given in that way.” 
        
       
      
    39 Although the trial judge gave an appropriate warning when the evidence was tendered it was not repeated in the summing up to the jury  
     
      
    40 As it happens, her Honour gave the warning required under s 14 on more than one occasion. Before the first witness was called her Honour said to the jury: 
     
      
       
        
        “They [the complainant and another child witness] will also, each of them, be giving their evidence in chief which is the first part of their evidence called by the Crown by a system of pre-recorded interview with them in accordance with the laws of their [sic] State. Now one thing I need to say to you about that, and I’ll warn you about it again, is that, that’s done simply because the laws of this State allow the evidence to be called in that way for children in cases such [as] this. And you’re not to draw any inference adverse to the accused or to give the evidence any lesser or greater weight just because it’s called in that way. It’s just the way it’s allowed to be done in New South Wales as a result of some more recent laws.” 
        
       
      
    41 Before the complainant was called the trial judge said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I should say to you about that evidence I’ll just repeat what I said I think it was yesterday. That is that this evidence is given in this form because the legislation of the State allows for that to occur. You should not draw any inference adverse to the accused because the evidence is being given in this way, nor should you give the evidence any lesser or greater weight because it is being called in that way. It is simply happening because it is allowed to happen that way as a result of the legislation of this State.” 
        
       
      
    42 Trial counsel did not seek a further warning from her Honour in accordance with s 14 during the summing up and accordingly r 4 applies. 
     
      
    43 In R v DBG (2002) 133 A Crim R 227 Howie J emphasised that it is preferable that a trial judge gives any information or warnings required in relation to particular evidence either immediately before or immediately after the giving of that evidence rather than wait until the summing up. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “For my part, I believe it is highly preferable that a trial judge gives such information and warnings as are required in respect of a particular part of the evidence that is to be given in a trial before a jury either immediately before or immediately after the giving of that evidence rather than to wait to fulfil that obligation during the course of the summing-up. Generally speaking, it would be expected that any information or warning that a jury is required to consider in their assessment of a particular piece of evidence would have considerably more impact upon the jury if given at a time proximate to the evidence. This does not mean that it would not be advisable, or even necessary in some cases, to convey that information or warning again during the course of the summing-up. But whether such a course is necessary in order to ensure a fair trial and one according to law will depend upon all the circumstances of the particular case and the nature of the information or warning that must be given.” 
         
        
       
      
    44 As his Honour points out providing information or warnings to the jury at that time is likely to have a greater impact than if left until the end of the trial. In my view this was clearly the case in this trial where I am satisfied that the warnings given must have had a significant impact on the approach which the jury took to the relevant evidence. This must also have been the view of trial counsel. In my opinion a miscarriage of justice has not occurred and I would refuse leave to raise this ground. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2: The trial miscarried because of the failure to deal properly with the evidence of the appellant’s daughter by particularly: 
       
      (a) allowing the transcripts and the video and audio of her interviews to go to the jury room; 
       
       
      (b) failing to give warnings concerning not giving disproportionate weight to the interviews; 
       
       
      (c) failure to warn the jury that no adverse inference was to be drawn against the accused because the witness was utilising the CCTV facility pursuant to s 25 of the  
      Evidence (Children) Act 
      . 
       
      
    45 Neither of the interviews conducted with the appellant’s daughter was recorded on video tape. However, an audio recording was made and was tendered without objection. The transcript of the first interview was also tendered without objection. Although the transcript of the second interview was not specifically marked as an exhibit it would appear that it was provided to the jury as an aide-memoire. 
     
      
    46 I have already concluded that the tender and provision of the video recording of the complainant’s evidence to the jury did not bring a miscarriage of justice. For the same reasons I am of the view that the audio tapes and transcripts, admitted without objection, had no capacity to cause a miscarriage of justice in the circumstances of this trial. The audio tapes occupied 2 hours of time. There was insufficient opportunity for the audio tapes to be listened to by the jury. No objection was made by trial counsel to the course taken by the trial judge. I would refuse leave to raise this matter. 
     
      
    47 Complaint is made by the appellant that there was a failure to give warnings to the jury that it should not give disproportionate weight to the interviews with LC. Before the appellant’s daughter was called by the Crown the trial judge said: 
     
      
       
        
        “And so ladies and gentlemen this evidence-in-chief from [LC] with the audio tapes is in much the same category as the evidence that [the complainant] gave, to the extent that it’s been given in this form because that’s what the law of this State says can happen. It was an audio recording, not a video recording. I warn you that you are not entitled to draw any inference adverse to the accused as a result of the evidence being given in that form, or give that evidence any greater or lesser weight as a result of it being given in that form.” 
        
       
      
    48 The trial judge gave a further warning on the next day of the trial. 
     
      
       
        
        “The same warning I gave to you in relation to the audio visual interview with the complainant applies equally to the interview of this witness. The evidence has been called in this way in chief because it can be as a result of the laws of this State you must not form any view adverse to the accused because it is happening in that way nor must you give the evidence any greater or lesser weight as a result of it being led that way. As I said to you earlier it is simply being led in that way because the laws of this State enable that to occur in relation to the evidence of children.” 
        
       
      
    49 When summing up to the jury the trial judge referred to the audio tapes of LC’s interviews acknowledging that the quality of the first tape was limited the second being “a little more audible.” Her Honour also referred to the fact that the transcripts were available “as evidence to read” in relation to the first interview and “to assist your understanding of the audio tape” in relation to the second interview. 
     
      
    50 Although at this point the trial judge did not repeat the warnings which had already been given, no objection was taken and her Honour was not asked to give a further warning. Mindful of the time which the jury took to deliberate and the clear warnings which had been given I do not believe a miscarriage of justice has occurred. I would decline leave to argue this matter. 
     
      
    51 Complaint was also made by the appellant that the trial judge failed to comply with s 25 of the Act. That section provides: 
     
      
       
        
        Warning to jury 
         
        (cf Crimes Act s 405H) 
         
         
        (1) In any criminal proceeding in which the evidence of a child is given by means of closed-circuit television facilities or any other similar technology (by virtue of section 18), the judge must:  
         
          
          (a) inform the jury that it is standard procedure for children’s evidence in such cases to be given by those means, and 
           
          (b) warn the jury not to draw any inference adverse to the accused person or give the evidence any greater or lesser weight because of the use of those facilities or that technology. 
          
         
         
        (2) In any criminal proceeding in which the evidence of a child is given by means of closed-circuit television facilities or any other similar technology (by virtue of section 19), the judge must warn the jury not to draw any inference adverse to the accused person or give the evidence any greater or lesser weight because of the use of those facilities or that technology. 
         
         
        (3) In any criminal proceeding in which arrangements are made for a person to be with a child giving evidence (by virtue of section 20 or 27), the judge must:  
         
          
          (a) inform the jury that it is standard procedure in such cases for children to choose a person to be with them, and 
           
          (b) warn the jury not to draw any inference adverse to the accused person or give the evidence any greater or lesser weight because of the presence of that person. 
          
         
         
        (4) In any criminal proceeding in which alternative arrangements for the giving of evidence by a child are made (by virtue of section 24 or 28), the judge must:  
         
          
          (a) inform the jury that it is standard procedure in such cases for alternative arrangements to be used when children give evidence, and 
           
          (b) warn the jury not to draw any inference adverse to the accused person or give the evidence any greater or lesser weight because of the use of those alternative arrangements.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    52 It was accepted that the directions which her Honour gave conformed with s 14 but it was submitted that her Honour did not warn the jury “not to use in any way adversely to the accused that the witness was utilising the CCTV facilities.” This submission overlooks the fact that when giving the warning to which I referred in [41] her Honour also said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The complainant who the Crown has already told you is now an eight year old girl will be giving evidence by a closed circuit television system and there is another witness who is also a child who will be giving her evidence by a closed circuit television system.” 
        
       
      
    53 Her Honour then continued as I have previously related. 
     
      
    54 In these circumstances the complaint made by the appellant has no justification. No further warning was sought from the trial judge and I would refuse leave to raise this matter. 
     
      
       
      Ground 3: the trial miscarried on the basis of improper cross examination of the appellant’s wife on the part of the Crown Prosecutor. 
       
      
    55 The appellant submitted that it was improper for the Crown to have attacked JC’s credibility on account of her not having said anything to the police about the fact that her daughter had told her that she had lied to the police in her second interview. Reliance is placed upon s 89 of the Evidence Act 1995 which prohibits the drawing of an inference unfavourable to a party from that party’s or person’s failure or refusal to answer questions or representations made in the course of “official questioning.” 
     
      
    56 This section is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        Evidence of silence 
         
         
        (1) In a criminal proceeding, an inference unfavourable to a party must not be drawn from evidence that the party or another person failed or refused:  
         
        (a) to answer one or more questions, or 
         
        (b) to respond to a representation, 
         
        put or made to the party or other person in the course of official questioning. 
         
         
        (2) Evidence of that kind is not admissible if it can only be used to draw such an inference. 
         
         
        (3) Subsection (1) does not prevent use of the evidence to prove that the party or other person failed or refused to answer the question or to respond to the representation if the failure or refusal is a fact in issue in the proceeding. 
         
         
        (4) In this section:  
         
         
        inference 
         includes:  
         
        (a) an inference of consciousness of guilt, or 
         
        (b) an inference relevant to a party’s credibility.” 
        
       
      
    57 The section was considered by this Court in Jones v R [2005] NSWCCA 443. In that case the question was whether or not a person who had been involved as a witness to a violent assault and remained silent when questioned by the police but who at the appellant’s trial gave evidence that she herself had committed the assault, could be criticised for her failure to tell the police, when questioned about the matter, that she had carried out the offence.  
     
      
    58 In my judgment (Simpson and Hoeben JJ agreed) I emphasised that s 89 has been carefully drafted to confine its operation. It only applies to a failure to answer or respond in the course of “official questioning” which means “questioning by an investigating official in connection with the investigation of the commission or possible commission of an offence”. In that case Ms Innes was arrested at the scene of the crime and later questioned by police. She did not tell the police officer of the events which she recounted in evidence. 
     
      
    59 In the present case JC said that she was told by her daughter that she had lied in her second statement because of pressure from the complainant in November 2004 before the police asked her to make a statement in April 2005. Accordingly, the opportunity to have told the police that her daughter had told her that she had lied was available otherwise than in the course of official questioning. In these circumstances s 89 has no application. The challenge to JC was not in terms, “why did you not respond to questions asked in the course of official questioning,” but rather, “why did you not go to the police and tell them your daughter’s second statement was not true.” 
     
      
    60 Although JC was asked by the police whether she wished to make a statement there was no relevant occasion when it could be said she failed or refused to answer questions or respond to a representation. Although in her evidence she accepted that she had information which was relevant to her daughter’s statement to the police, there was no occasion which constituted evidence of her silence as contemplated by s 89. 
     
      
    61 In any event the explanation which JC gave for not having told the police was both rational and, in my view, capable of being accepted by the jury. It was perfectly understandable that having been warned not to speak with her daughter about her evidence she would not want to disclose the fact that she had lest she be accused of having influenced the evidence her daughter would give. She also said that she sought legal advice. The Crown did not challenge that evidence, although they could have sought evidence from the lawyer. In these circumstances if the jury otherwise thought JC was a credible witness there is no reason why the jury should not have accepted her explanation. 
     
      
    62 The issue played little, if any, part in the Crown’s final address in which the Crown said of JC’s evidence, amongst other matters: 
     
      
       
        
        “Strangely, her evidence was that even though she knew that L had lied to police, she didn’t tell the police about that. What you make of that is up to you, members of the jury.” 
        
       
      
    63 When summing up to the jury the trial judge said of this issue: 
     
      
       
        
        “The Crown in relation to that evidence puts to you that you would not place much weight on the evidence of [JC] and suggests to you that, in some respects, you would form an adverse view about her because discovering that her daughter claims to be telling lies to the police, she did nothing to bring that to the attention of the police. You know the evidence that the Crown got in the case was that the police asked her for a statement but, as I understand the evidence it was about March this year that the statement was asked for from [JC] and that she declined to give that statement to police. Her explanation for that, you know in her evidence, was that she did not think she had anything to add because she had not heard anything. 
        
       
       
        
        She also said to you that part of the reason why she did not tell police anything about what [LC] had said to her was because she was frightened of the police and gave you some evidence about that had been said to her when she went to pick up [LC] on 2 September in which she was warned not to talk to her about the interviews that she had given and that, if she did, she could be in trouble and possibly have her children taken away from her. 
        
       
       
        
        Now make what you will of that evidence ladies and gentlemen but you might think that if there was much to be made of that, it might have been put to Detective Marshall when she was being cross-examined on behalf of the accused. On the other hand, you might equally think that if the police really wanted to get a statement from [JC] about what happened that night, they might have asked her well before March 2005. It is a matter for you ladies and gentlemen what to make of that evidence.” 
        
       
      
    64 No objection was taken to the cross examination and no direction was sought confining the use of the evidence or any inference to be drawn from it. As the remarks of the prosecutor indicate, and the trial judge confirmed, the prosecution did not identify the issue as being of significance or urge any particular finding. Leave is required to argue the matter. I would refuse that leave. 
     
      
       
      Ground 4: the trial miscarried on account of the trial judge’s directions concerning the evidence of JC. 
       
      
    65 The appellant complained on the appeal that the trial judge’s directions concerning the evidence of JC were unfair. In particular complaint was made with respect to the suggestion that her evidence that she did not approach the police because of a warning from them that she should not talk to her daughter should not be accepted because that matter had not been raised with the relevant police officer in cross-examination. 
     
      
    66 Her Honour’s statement was in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “Now make what you will of that evidence ladies and gentlemen but you might think that if there was much to be made of that, it might have been put to detective Marshall when she was being cross-examined on behalf of the accused.” 
        
       
      
    67 At the trial counsel for the appellant requested that that part of the directions be withdrawn. The trial judge responded to that request and a further direction was given to the jury. Her Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The other issue that I wish to correct, and to withdraw from you, is a direction that I gave you in relation to the evidence of [JC], and when I was going through with you her evidence in response to the Crown’s questions as to why she did not feel it necessary to tell the police that [LC] had told her some time after she moved schools that in fact she had told lies to the police in her interviews. You remember the evidence that I was referring to, in which she said that, well, she was scared of the police because Detective Marshall had told her that she should not talk about what [LC] said in the interview and if she did she might be in trouble, including having her children taken away from her. I said to you that when taking into account whether or not you accept that as an explanation by her and therefore whether you reject the Crown’s submission to you that you would not regard her as a witness whose evidence was of great weight, that you might think that if there was going to be anything made of that, that would have been put to Detective Marshall. Well, I withdraw that direction to you. 
        
       
       
        
        You are not entitled to take that into account, for this reason, and that is that when [JC] gave that evidence, she gave that evidence in response to a question from the Crown in cross-examination. She was not asked that in chief. She did not volunteer that information. She gave it in response to a question from the Crown, and there is no evidence in the trial that the counsel for the accused ought to have known that is what she was going to say and therefore had any obligation to put that to Detective Marshall. So that it is not right that you ought to take that into account, that it was not put to Detective Marshall. The fact is that on the way the evidence has come out in this Court, there was no evidence that Mr Greenhill or his client knew that that is what she was going to say.” 
        
       
      
    68 No further complaint was made about the direction. In my opinion, the problem identified by trial counsel was adequately dealt with by her Honour. In the absence of any further complaint I would refuse leave under Rule 4 to raise this ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      Ground 5 
       
      
    69 The appellant was granted leave to amend ground five of the appeal. The amended ground reads as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “(a) the trial judge’s directions, warning the jury that the evidence of the appellant’s daughter may be unreliable were erroneous. 
        
       
       
        
        (b) the trial judge erred in the circumstances of this case by failing to give an unreliability warning in respect of the complainant’s evidence pursuant to s 165B  
        Evidence Act. 
        ” 
        
       
      
    70 The Crown made an application at the trial for her Honour to give an “unreliability warning” in relation to the evidence of LC on the basis that LC had given different versions of events and admitted that one statement she gave to the police was untrue. The Crown did not seek a direction that her evidence was unreliable on account of her age. The application was made pursuant to s 165(1) of the Evidence Act. 
     
      
    71 Counsel for the appellant initially contended that the evidence given by LC in response to cross examination by the Crown ought to attract an unreliability warning but this submission was withdrawn. Counsel for the appellant also opposed an unreliability warning being given solely in relation to LC and suggested that s 165B of the Evidence Act applied to the evidence of both children and that a warning as required by that section should be given. It was further submitted that a warning was required in relation to the complainant’s evidence. 
     
      
    72 The trial judge ultimately concluded that there were specific factors that warranted an unreliability warning in LC’s case but that these factors were not present in respect of the complainant’s evidence. She gave a warning in relation to LC’s evidence which was in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “You must asses [LC] as a witness and decide what, if any of her evidence, you accept is reliable, that is truthful and accurate. 
        
       
       
        
        In relation to [LC’s] evidence, ladies and gentlemen, I must warn you that for a variety of reasons her evidence may be unreliable. Those reasons are that she comes to court as a young girl of eight, giving evidence against her father, in circumstances where she has, you know, given different versions of the events, some of which are inconsistent with each other, and in circumstances where she has told you that so far as at least one of them is concerned, she lied to the police in the interview. 
        
       
       
        
        Furthermore, in relation to some of the answers she gave you, it was in responses to questions asked by way of cross examination of her by the Crown after I allowed that to occur when it became clear that she claimed that what was in her interviews was untrue. It is for these reasons that I warn you that her evidence may be unreliable, and you should take this warning from me into account when assessing what if any of her evidence you can accept in this trial.” 
        
       
      
    73 Apart from the matters to which I have referred in [72] the appellant’s counsel specifically opposed her Honour giving a warning on the basis that LC was the appellant’s daughter and submitted that this fact did not bring her evidence within a class of witness contemplated by s 165(1). It was submitted that the jury were in a position to determine what weight to give that fact. It was further submitted that the directions concerning the inconsistencies in LC’s evidence were factors which, consistent with authority in this Court, did not to warrant a direction pursuant to s 165(1) of the Evidence Act. 
     
      
    74 It was submitted to this Court that her Honour was in error to have found, for the reasons that she did, that LC’s evidence was of a kind that may be unreliable and caught by s 165(1). The appellant relied on the decision in R v Stewart 52 NSWLR 301 where Howie J (with whom Hulme J agreed) stated at [99]: 
     
      
       
        
        “In my opinion, matters which would not generally attract a warning under s 165 include: prior inconsistent statements made by a witness; inconsistencies within the evidence of a witness; inconsistencies between the evidence of a witness and other evidence in the trial; an allegation of bias made against a witness; or the fact that it has been suggested that the witness had a motive to lie. Evidence which is tainted by any of these types of matters is not for that reason alone ‘evidence of a kind that may be unreliable.’ However, as I will indicate later, these types of matters might be made the subject of comments by a trial judge, and, in the case of a crucial Crown witness, a summing up may be defective if no reference is made by the trial judge to such matters when reviewing the case against the accused.” 
        
       
      
    75 Sections 165A and 165B of the Evidence Act, which deal specifically with the category of evidence given by children, were not considered by this Court in Stewart in which judgment was delivered on 5 September 2001. Sections 165A and 165B were introduced by the Evidence Legislation Amendment Act 2001 (NSW) the commencement date for which was 26 July 2002. 
     
      
    76 The relevant sections provide: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        165 Unreliable evidence 
         
         
        (1) This section applies to evidence of a kind that may be unreliable, including the following kinds of evidence:  
         
         
          
          (a) evidence in relation to which Part 3.2 (hearsay evidence) or 3.4 (admissions) applies, 
          
         
         
        (b) identification evidence, 
         
         
          
          (c) evidence the reliability of which may be affected by age, ill health (whether physical or mental), injury or the like, 
          
         
         
          
          (d) evidence given in a criminal proceeding by a witness, being a witness who might reasonably be supposed to have been criminally concerned in the events giving rise to the proceeding, 
          
         
         
          
          (e) evidence given in a criminal proceeding by a witness who is a prison informer, 
          
         
         
          
          (f) oral evidence of official questioning of a defendant that is questioning recorded in writing that has not been signed, or otherwise acknowledged in writing, by the defendant, 
          
         
         
          
          (g) in a proceeding against the estate of a deceased person—evidence adduced by or on behalf of a person seeking relief in the proceeding that is evidence about a matter about which the deceased person could have given evidence if he or she were alive. 
          
         
         
        (2) If there is a jury and a party so requests, the judge is to:  
         
         
          
          (a) warn the jury that the evidence may be unreliable, and 
          
         
         
          
          (b) inform the jury of matters that may cause it to be unreliable, and 
          
         
         
          
          (c) warn the jury of the need for caution in determining whether to accept the evidence and the weight to be given to it. 
          
         
         
        (3) The judge need not comply with subsection (2) if there are good reasons for not doing so. 
         
         
        (4) It is not necessary that a particular form of words be used in giving the warning or information. 
         
         
        (5) This section does not affect any other power of the judge to give a warning to, or to inform, the jury. 
         
         
        (6) Subsection (2) does not permit a judge to warn or inform a jury in proceedings before it in which a child gives evidence that the reliability of the child’s evidence may be affected by the age of the child. Any such warning or information may be given only in accordance with section 165B. 
         
         
        Note. The Commonwealth Act does not include subsection (6). 
         
         
         
        165A Warnings about children’s evidence 
         
         
        (1) A judge in any proceeding in which evidence is given by a child must not warn a jury, or make any suggestion to a jury, that children as a class are unreliable witnesses. 
         
         
        (2) Without limiting subsection (1), that subsection prohibits a general warning to a jury of the danger of convicting on the uncorroborated evidence of any child witness. 
         
         
        (3) Sections 164 and 165 are subject to this clause. 
        
       
       
        
        165B Warnings about a particular child’s evidence 
         
         
        (1) This section applies to evidence given by a child in proceedings before a jury. 
         
         
        (2) A judge in any proceedings in which evidence to which this section applies is given may:  
         
          
          (a) warn or inform the jury that the evidence of the particular child may be unreliable because of the child’s age, and 
           
          (b) warn the jury of the need for caution in determining whether to accept the evidence of the particular child and the weight to be given to it. 
          
         
         
        (3) Such a warning or information may be given only:  
         
        (a) if a party has requested that it be given, and 
         
          
          (b) if that party has satisfied the court that there are circumstances particular to that child in those proceedings that affect the reliability of the child’s evidence and that warrant the giving of a warning or the information. 
          
         
         
        (4) This section does not affect any other power of a judge to give a warning to, or to inform, the jury.” 
        
       
      
    77 It was submitted to this Court that having given a warning pursuant to s 165(1) in respect of LC’s evidence, unless a warning was given in relation to the complainant’s evidence an unfair imbalance would be created. It was submitted that the prejudice thereby created could only be addressed by a direction in relation to the evidence of the complainant, which should have warned the jury that, on account of the witness’s tender age of seven at the time of the incident, together with the possibility that her evidence was the result of suggestions made to her, her evidence may be unreliable. 
     
      
    78 If the appellant was wrong concerning the necessity to warn the jury about the evidence of the complainant it was submitted that, in any event, the directions given pursuant to s 165 were unfairly balanced against the appellant and improperly impugned the evidence of LC. 
     
      
    79 In Stewart this Court was divided as to whether s 165 should be understood having regard to the common law origins of warnings or seen as a “fresh start”. It is not necessary to enter upon that debate to resolve this appeal. However, it is plain that when a judge gives a warning it will commonly be seen by the jury to be of importance with a potential to significantly influence the jury when it is considering whether or not to accept that witness’s evidence. This must have been the case in the present matter. 
     
      
    80 For this reason although the justification for a warning is not exhaustively provided by s 165(1), to my mind, careful reflection is necessary before accepting that evidence which falls outside any of the categories identified in the section should be the subject of a warning. Furthermore, if in a particular case the evidence of a witness is the subject of a warning, care should be exercised to ensure that evidence of another witness, whose evidence may be thought to have similar characteristics justifying a warning, is also made the subject of a similar warning. This is particularly the case if the witnesses are perceived to be separately favourable to the Crown or the defence. Unless this course is taken the potential for a warning to influence the jury is so great that the trial may become unfair. 
     
      
    81 The warning which the trial judge gave in relation to LC raised a number of matters for the jury’s consideration. The reference to her age implied, in my view, that being aged only eight the jury should for that reason alone consider whether her evidence may be unreliable. However, the direction went significantly further and carried with it warnings because: 
     
      
    · She was giving evidence against her father (this should I believe have referred to “for her father”); 
     
      
    · She had given inconsistent accounts of the events; 
     
      
    · She told the police that she had lied to them; 
     
      
    · She had given untrue answers in cross-examination after the Crown had been allowed to attack her evidence. 
     
      
    82 Leaving aside the matter of her age, each of the other matters referred to by the trial judge required careful consideration by the jury. Any one of them, or a combination of them, may have caused the jury to reject her evidence, at least where it was favourable to her father. However, there was nothing about any of the matters which brought them within the kind or type of evidence which may be unreliable as contemplated in s 165. The jury may have concluded that her evidence was unreliable, but, they should have been left to form that judgment for themselves, without the burden of a warning from the trial judge.  
     
      
    83 To my mind the warning which the trial judge gave in the present case with respect to LC’s evidence was not justified by s 165 and, either alone, or, together with the failure to give a warning in relation to the evidence of the complainant has occasioned a serious injustice. Although LC and the complainant were relatively young there was nothing in their evidence which, by reason of their age, justified a warning to the jury. If a warning was justified, a warning was required in relation to the evidence of both children because they were of similar ages. However, I am satisfied that a warning was not required and the case should have been left to the jury without a warning in relation to either child’s evidence. 
     
      
    84 Any chance which the appellant had of an acquittal was significantly influenced by the approach which the jury took to his daughter’s evidence. If it was rejected, the likelihood of the jury accepting the complainant’s evidence was overwhelming. In these circumstances I am satisfied that the appellant lost the chance of an acquittal and a new trial should be ordered. 
     
      
    85 It is unnecessary to deal with the sentence matter. 
     
      
       
      Orders 
       
      1. The appeal is allowed. 
       
      2. The convictions and sentences are quashed. 
       
      3. Order a new trial.

    2 HISLOP J: I agree with Johnson J. 
     
      
    3 JOHNSON J: The Appellant, Heriberto Robinson Sepulveda, appeals against conviction for a number of offences of buggery and indecent assault following two separate trials before his Honour Judge Woods QC and juries in the Sydney District Court in 2004. 
     
      
       
      Convictions of Appellant Following Two Trials 
       
      
    4 At the first trial, which occurred between 7 and 28 June 2004, the Appellant was convicted of two counts of indecent assault upon JD under s.81 Crimes Act 1900 and five counts of buggery against BD under s.79 Crimes Act 1900, together with six counts of indecent assault upon BD under s.81 of that Act. All offences for which the Appellant was convicted at the first trial occurred between 1978 and 1984.  
     
      
    5 At the second trial, which took place between 1 and 8 December 2004, the Appellant was convicted of two counts of indecent assault upon ID under s.81 Crimes Act 1900. These offences took place between 1979 and 1981.  
     
      
    6 On 17 December 2004, his Honour Judge Woods QC sentenced the Appellant to terms of imprisonment giving rise to a total effective term of imprisonment for 11 years with a non-parole period of seven years, with both periods to date from 28 June 2004. The Appellant is not eligible for release on parole until 27 June 2011. 
     
      
    7 For present purposes, it is not necessary to set out the individual sentences imposed for each of the various offences for which the Appellant was convicted. The present appeal relates to conviction only. The Appellant has abandoned his application for leave to appeal against sentence. Of course, if the appeal against conviction succeeds with respect to any of the counts for which he was convicted, it will be necessary to consider the impact of that result upon the sentences imposed in the District Court. 
     
      
       
      Application for Extension of Time to Appeal Against Conviction at Second Trial 
       
      
    8 Until shortly before the hearing of this appeal on 18 May 2006, the Appellant’s Notice of Appeal was confined to the first trial and the grounds of appeal which had been notified were limited to that trial. On 16 May 2006, the Appellant’s solicitors gave notice of appeal with respect to the second trial. The Appellant seeks an extension of time to file that Notice of Appeal.  
     
      
    9 It is apparent that the Appellant has failed to comply with the provisions contained in clauses 3A and 3B Criminal Appeal Rules with respect to the second trial. An application for an extension of time may be made after the expiration of the relevant period: clause 3B(2). The Court has a discretion with respect to an extension of time. In exercising that discretion, the Court has regard to the prospects of success on the appeal itself, and will usually require some satisfactory explanation as to why an appeal was not brought within the time allowed, especially if the delay is considerable: Douar v The Queen (2005) 159 A Crim R 154 at 163 [53]. 
     
      
    10 In the present case, Mr Molomby SC, for the Appellant, submits that the grounds of appeal against conviction with respect of the second trial are virtually the same as the grounds concerning the first trial. He informed the Court that the explanation for the failure to lodge an appeal concerning the second trial is oversight on the part of the Appellant’s legal representatives. 
     
      
    11 The Crown neither opposed nor consented to the application for extension of time. At short notice, the Crown prepared written submissions and a trial summary concerning the second trial so that the Court would be in a position to deal with that appeal at the same time as the appeal concerning the first trial, if an extension of time was granted. The Court was assisted greatly by the urgent preparation of this material by the Crown.  
     
      
    12 It is true that the grounds of appeal against conviction are very similar with respect to both the first and second trials. In these circumstances, an extension of time ought be granted to the Appellant so that, in the interests of justice, the grounds of appeal concerning both trials may be determined by this Court. This approach has been influenced significantly by the willingness of the Crown to prepare urgently for the appeal with respect to the second trial, so that the Court is in a position to deal with both appeals at the same time. It is the case, however, that the appeal papers provided to this Court are prepared by reference to the trial or trials to which grounds of appeal relate. In this case, due to the Appellant’s delay, the Court received material concerning the second trial in a fragmented and disorganised way during the course of the hearing. 
     
      
    13 The decision to extend time in the present appeal ought not be taken as encouragement to other appellants to leave decisions of this type to the last minute, in the expectation that an extension of time will necessarily be allowed.  
     
      
       
      The Grounds of Appeal 
       
      
    14 The grounds of appeal pressed at the hearing of the appeal were as follows. 
     
      
    15 As to the first trial: 
     
      
       
      Ground 1 
       - The learned trial Judge erred in law in admitting evidence of a clandestinely recorded conversation.  
       
       
      Ground 2 
       - The learned trial Judge erred in law in failing to give a direction pursuant to  
      Longman v The Queen 
       (1990) 168 CLR 79 in relation to the complainant BD. 
       
      
    16 As to the second trial: 
     
      
       
      Ground 1 
       - The learned trial Judge erred in law in admitting evidence of a clandestinely recorded conversation. 
       
       
      Ground 2 
       - The learned trial Judge erred in law in failing to give a  
      Longman  
      direction, or failing to give an adequate  
      Longman  
      direction, in relation to the complainant ID. 
       
       
      The Crown and Defence Cases at the First Trial 
       
       
      The Crown Case 
       
      
    17 JD and BD are brothers. They have a middle brother, ID. The boys’ father was killed in a motor car accident in Lebanon before the family migrated to Australia. The Appellant (then known as Albert Robinson) lived in the same street in Stanmore as the boys and their mother. At times which are presently relevant, the boys were spending considerable time on the streets without parental guidance. 18 When they first met the Appellant, JD was aged 12 years (date of birth 25 April 1970) and BD was aged 12 or 13 years (date of birth 27 March 1966). 
     
      
    19 It was the Crown case that the Appellant befriended the victims JD and BD and later developed a relationship with their mother. The boys played with other children in a playground in the street in Stanmore where they lived. Over the course of several years, the Appellant engaged in sexual behaviour separately with JD and BD. This usually occurred at the offices or business premises where the Appellant worked as a contract cleaner in the evenings. The older brother, BD, worked for the Appellant as his assistant for several years. Both victims gave evidence that the Appellant paid them to engage in sexual behaviour. 
     
      
       
      Counts Concerning JD 
        
       
      
    20 The Appellant stood trial on six counts concerning JD, and was convicted on two counts. 
     
      
    21 Count 1: Between 1979-1981, when JD was about 9-11 years old, he was with the Appellant when he was cleaning the Wilson’s Fabrics Building in Waterloo. He remembered the Appellant playing with, and then sucking, his (JD’s) penis. JD said that he (JD) ejaculated into the Appellant’s mouth (verdict - not guilty). 
     
      
    22 Count 2: Between 1982-1984, when JD was about 12-14 years old, he was helping the Appellant cleaning a building in Neutral Bay. He remembered them getting on the floor and sucking one another’s penises in what he now described as a “69” position (verdict - guilty). 
     
      
    23 Count 3: Again between 1982-1984, when JD was about 12-14 years old, he recalled that he got cheeky with the Appellant, who slapped him in the face, but the Appellant soon after apologised and offered to buy him a watch, as well as pay him for sex. JD sucked the Appellant’s penis until the Appellant ejaculated (verdict - guilty). 
     
      
    24 Count 4: In 1983-1984, when JD was about 13-14 years old, he was with the Appellant in another building at Lane Cove. He recalled that there were pool umbrellas and lounges on display in part of the building. The Appellant asked if he could lick JD’s anus and, in due course, JD let him do this. Whilst the Appellant was doing this, the Appellant played with JD’s bottom until JD ejaculated. This happened in the pool showroom (verdict - not guilty). 
     
      
    25 Count 5: In 1983-1984, when JD was about 13-14 years old, again at the Lane Cove building, the Appellant was licking JD’s bottom and also masturbating him. The Appellant tried to place his penis in JD’s anus but JD jumped up and got cranky at the Appellant (verdict - not guilty). 
     
      
    26 Count 6: In 1983-1984, when JD was about 13-14 years old, again at the Lane Cove building, the Appellant was simulating anal sex between JD’s legs and attempted to stick his penis in JD’s anus. JD jumped up and did not let him do this (verdict - not guilty). 
     
      
       
      Counts Concerning BD 
       
      
    27 The Appellant stood trial on 13 counts concerning BD, and was convicted on 11 counts. 
     
      
    28 Count 7: Between 1978-1980, when BD was about 12-13 years old, BD remembered being in a building (Wilson’s Fabrics at Waterloo) with the Appellant and going with him into the sick bay in a ladies’ toilet. The Appellant unzipped his (the Appellant’s) pants, pulled out his penis which was hard and erect, and BD sucked the Appellant’s penis until the Appellant ejaculated onto a paper towel because BD would not accept it in his mouth (verdict - guilty). 
     
      
    29 Count 8: At the same time and place as Count 7, the Appellant performed oral sex on BD (verdict - guilty). 
     
      
    30 Count 9: Between 1978-1980, when BD was about 12-13 years old, again at Wilson’s Fabrics at Waterloo, the Appellant and BD were in the sick bay in the ladies’ toilet. The Appellant asked him to try anal sex. BD was lying on his side and the Appellant began penetrating him but it hurt (verdict - guilty). 
     
      
    31 Count 10: At the same time and place as Count 9, once the Appellant and BD stopped having anal sex, they finished off with oral sex (verdict - guilty). 
     
      
    32 Count 11: Between 1979-1980, when BD was about 13 years old, again at Wilson’s Fabrics at Waterloo, he remembered lying flat on his stomach after the Appellant placed him face down on the lounge. The Appellant knelt down so he was sitting on his heels, dragged BD up by his hips and put his penis part way up BD’s anus. He stopped and sucked BD’s penis, then continued with the anal intercourse, until BD ejaculated in his mouth (verdict - guilty). 
     
      
    33 Count 12: At the same time and place as Count 11, BD asked the Appellant to wash his penis. The Appellant went out, then came back into the room and BD sucked the Appellant’s penis until the Appellant ejaculated (verdict - guilty). 
     
      
    34 Count 13: Between 1979-1980, when BD was about 13 years old, he was with the Appellant and another boy in the sick bay at Wilson’s Fabrics at Waterloo when the Appellant penetrated BD’s anus with his penis while the other boy was kneeling down in front of BD and sucking BD’s penis (verdict - guilty). 
     
      
    35 Count 14: Between 1980-1981, when BD was about 14 years old, he went to the Appellant’s house in Stanmore during the day. BD remembered sleeping, watching videos and waking up and saw that the Appellant was pulling down his pants, and then anally penetrating him, for a few minutes until the Appellant ejaculated into BD’s anus (verdict - guilty). 
     
      
    36 Count 15: At the same time and place as Count 14, the Appellant masturbated BD until BD ejaculated (verdict - guilty). 
     
      
    37 Count 16: Between 1982-1983 when BD was about 16 years old, he was cleaning a building at Lane Cove with the Appellant. BD particularly remembered this incident because he had his learner’s permit, and was permitted to drive the Appellant’s Holden Monaro. There was a soft couch in the building and he remembered lying face down. The Appellant anally penetrated BD until the Appellant ejaculated (verdict - guilty). 
     
      
    38 Count 17: At the same time and place as Count 16, the Appellant performed oral sex on BD (verdict - guilty). 
     
      
    39 Count 18: This was an allegation of buggery at Lane Cove between 1982-1984. However, BD did not give evidence of this occurring. His evidence was that he was participating in a threesome with another boy and the Appellant and the other boy sucked BD’s penis until BD ejaculated (verdict of not guilty by direction). 
     
      
    40 Count 19: This was an allegation of buggery at the Appellant’s new home in Auburn in 1983-1984 when BD was “about 18”. In light of the dates and the decriminalisation of homosexuality between consenting adults in 1984, a verdict of not guilty was directed on this count. 
     
      
       
      Relationship, Tendency and Coincidence Evidence 
       
      
    41 The Crown led relationship evidence of other sexual behaviour between the Appellant and the victims. Some of the charges were particularised in the indictment by reason of each victim’s particular memories or associations of other events that occurred in these incidents. 
     
      
    42 Tendency and coincidence evidence was led by the Crown arising from the Appellant’s conviction for homosexual intercourse in 1985 with a separate victim, BG, when BG was aged 14 years. This evidence was given through a retired police office, Mr Fluke. He testified that, on 30 August 1989 (having been charged in February 1986), the Appellant pleaded guilty to having homosexual intercourse on about 10 December 1985 with BG, aged between 10 and 18 years, for which he was sentenced to imprisonment for 18 months to be served by way of periodic detention. The Appellant had picked up BG, a mentally disabled 14-year old boy, from the vicinity of the Sydney Entertainment Centre and had taken him to one of his cleaning jobs in Neutral Bay. He had anal intercourse with the boy whilst he lay naked face down on the lounge. Prior to driving the boy home, the Appellant gave him $30.00 cash. In addition to the evidence of Mr Fluke, the Crown called BG who gave evidence to the effect that the Appellant sexually assaulted him in the manner described above. 
     
      
    43 The Crown contended that there were striking similarities between the indecent sexual conduct of the Appellant towards BG and his conduct towards the complainants JD and BD (except with respect to Counts 14 and 15). This included sexual conduct having occurred in empty buildings where the Appellant regularly cleaned and his payment of money for sex. The Crown contended that this was evidence available to be used by the jury to conclude (in respect of counts other than Counts 14 and 15), that the Appellant had “a tendency to strike up relationships with boys of an age similar to the alleged victims in this case, to take them to buildings which he had a contract to clean, to engage in indecent sexual contact with them, and to pay them small sums of money” (SU20). The Crown contended that it was also open to the jury to consider that the Appellant’s conduct in the present case, and in the case of BG, was “so strikingly similar that you would regard this coincidence as tending to remove any doubt from your mind that the accused was guilty of the present charges - that is to say, all the charges except 14 and 15” (SU20). 
     
      
       
      The Complainants’ Mother 
       
      
    44 The mother of JD and BD gave evidence in the Crown case. She said that when BD was aged 13 years, she went to pick him up from school, only to find the Appellant had taken him to buy a pair of shoes. She also stated that the Appellant took her three children to work with him for $20.00 each and brought them food from McDonalds. She gave evidence that he took BD with him to work until after midnight and, as a result, the boy started to miss school. Ultimately, the mother and the Appellant had a relationship, he asked her to marry him and they spoke about buying a house. However, as she expressed it, “he was lying to me” (T290.51). 
     
      
       
      BD’s Wife 
       
      
    45 BD’s wife gave evidence in the Crown case. In 1986, she and BD wanted to marry. She came from a strict Greek background and they both anticipated opposition from their respective families. When they discussed how they would break the news to their families, BD informed her that there was something he had to tell her before they got married. BD told her “when I was working as a cleaner at night my mother’s boyfriend had sex with me and later he offered money for sex” (T340.44) and that “he’s fleeing from the police”. BD and his then fiancé married in June 1990.  
     
      
       
      The Recorded Conversation Between the Appellant and JD 
       
      
    46 The clandestinely recorded conversation, referred to in Ground 1 with respect to both trials, came into existence in the following way.  
     
      
    47 JD gave evidence that he did not have contact with the Appellant for some five years from about 1994 (when he was aged 24 years) to 1999 (when aged 29 years). In May 1999, JD contacted the Appellant, asking if he had a cleaning job that he could give him. After contacting the Appellant, JD met with him and had consensual sex at one of the buildings that the Appellant was cleaning. It was on a second visit to this building that JD recorded a conversation with the Appellant on a concealed micro cassette tape recorder. In the conversation, the Appellant makes admissions of having under-aged sex with the brothers (T153-5). An edited version of the tape was admitted at the trial (Exhibit B) and played to the jury. In his remarks on sentence on 17 December 2004, his Honour Judge Woods QC observed that the tape recording supplemented the direct evidence of the three D brothers and “provided powerful admissions of his sexual behaviour and relationships with the boys during the period in question” (ROS5). 48 Before the jury, JD said the purpose of taping the Appellant “was because he sexually abused me when I was young and plus he sexually abused my brothers and he broke my mother’s heart” (T155.1, 9 June 2004). JD explained “yes, I was just trying to get what happened to us when we were young and plus some of the other boys that were around, I was just trying to get justice for everyone” (T155.33).  
     
      
    49 After the cleaning job, the Appellant drove JD home. As JD got out of the car, he informed the Appellant that he had taped their conversation. According to JD, the Appellant cried and offered him $50,000.00 for his silence and the tape. A week later, JD settled on $2,000.00 which he needed for arrears on rent. He met at a Commonwealth Bank where the Appellant organised for JD to sign a document that he would not take the Appellant to court.  
     
      
    50 JD signed two documents. The first (Exhibit C) stated “I [JD] will setel [sic] for $2,000.00 not to take Albert Robinson to court for melestoring [sic] me and my brothers and friends 19 years ago. JD”. The second document (Exhibit D) stated “I, [JD], will not take Albert Robinson to court because he paid me $2,000.00”. The Appellant handed JD the money, which JD later discovered to be only $1,750.00, and JD handed the Appellant a tape - but it was not the right tape. JD kept the correct tape. Exhibits C and D (the documents written by JD) were found by police in the Appellant’s house when he was arrested a year later. 
     
      
    51 With the money obtained from the Appellant, JD stated that he paid rent, bills and bought groceries. Records from a Century 21 Agency (Exhibit H) showed JD to be behind in his rent, which he rectified with payments of 11 June 1999 (of $280.00 plus $10.00) and 12 July 1999 ($420.00).  
     
      
    52 Two weeks later, JD spoke to a solicitor, Ms Hopkinson, who had carriage of JD’s worker’s compensation claim with respect to a thumb injury. He told her what had happened to him when he was younger and about the tape recording (T164.30). Ms Hopkinson referred JD to the police, to whom he spoke and handed the tape recording, on 19 July 1999.  
     
      
    53 After taking a formal statement from JD which took several days due to its length, police approached his brother BD, who declined to make a statement. Some years later, BD was subpoenaed to court on 25 March 2002, and, on that occasion, he spoke to police. On 25 March 2002, the Appellant was standing trial with respect to alleged offences committed against JD and his brother ID. As a result of BD giving a statement to police and there being fresh evidence and allegations available, that trial was vacated. 
     
      
    54 On 30 August 2000, the Appellant was arrested. When asked by the police “Did he [JD] tape a conversation between you two?”, the Appellant said, “Yes, he came to one of my jobs, he used a knife to make me say things, he was really crazy, he gave me some tape or something, it was the wrong one …” (T233.54, 10 June 2004). The Appellant also told police that he gave JD the sum of $2,000.00 for rent which he got from his father’s bank account (T233.35). The Appellant had exactly the same name as his father. His father’s Commonwealth Bank records (Exhibit K; T246, 10 June 2004) indicated that an amount of $1,760.00 was withdrawn on 4 June 1999.  
     
      
       
      The Defence Case 
       
      
    55 The Appellant gave evidence at the first trial. He denied anything of a sexual nature took place between himself and JD and BD at any time whilst they were under 18 years of age. He acknowledged a sexual relationship with BD when BD was aged between 18 and 21 years old, at which time he said BD met his fiancé. He also acknowledged having sex with JD, but only when JD was an adult.  
     
      
    56 It was the Appellant’s case that, as a result of telling JD about his prosecution for sexual intercourse with the other boy (BG), JD was motivated to extort money from him, threatening to accuse the Appellant of under-age sex with him if he did not pay (T429-431). The Appellant had been paying money to JD and pressure was being applied on the Appellant to pay more money to him, especially at the time when JD made the tape recording of the conversation, and when the D’s family home burnt down (T204-5, 430-434, 438-440). The Appellant said that he was afraid that he may be assaulted by JD (T432). He said that he gave JD the sum of $1,750.00 from a Commonwealth Bank account when they went to the bank together, and a further $250.00 a few days later (T454-455). 
     
      
    57 The Appellant said that he lived in a homosexual relationship with Jose Matto from 1984 to 1989. Mr Matto gave evidence confirming this fact. In relation to the alleged offences, he said that there were security cameras, security guards and staff at the various buildings that the Appellant cleaned. Mr Matto also worked with the Appellant on a regular basis for several years and their supervisors regularly visited the premises whilst they were cleaning to check on progress on the work and to supply them with cleaning materials. 
     
      
    58 Mr Matto gave evidence that when he was working with the Appellant, he never saw any boys in the buildings, and he had only seen BD once when he came to the door asking for the Appellant (T580). 
     
      
    59 The Appellant agreed that BD had worked with him from the age of about 16-17 years, but he denied having sexual relations with him until he was 18 years old. 
     
      
    60 In relation to the recorded conversation with JD in 1999, the Appellant said that he felt threatened by JD for some time (he knew JD had criminal convictions) and during the recorded conversations, JD had his hand in his pocket, which caused the Appellant alarm because he thought he might be harmed if he disagreed with JD. He agreed with various incriminating propositions put forward by JD about under-age sex with the brothers to protect his own safety (T441-449). According to the Appellant, as he dropped JD off following the conversation, JD attempted to punch him through the window of the vehicle (T450). He said that JD left a threatening message on the Appellant’s answering machine at home demanding money from him (Exhibit 2, T435-6). So far as the recording on the micro cassette tape was concerned, the Appellant said he gave inaccurate responses to JD because he was scared and made “him happy with my answers”. He said the references to sex in the tape were at a time when they were adults, not children. On the tape, the Appellant was heard to say “[BD] was in love with me”. The Appellant said that if JD thought “if I have someone of his family on his side he will act in a different way”. In cross-examination, the Appellant agreed that he did not know that JD had a tape recorder. Despite having told the police that JD “used a knife to make me say things”, the Appellant agreed that he never saw a weapon. 
     
      
    61 The Appellant said that he gave $1,760.00 from the bank account because JD threatened him. He said that JD threw the two notes (Exhibits C and D) on the back seat of his car. He read one, but not the other and kept them as souvenirs. 
     
      
    62 With respect to this conviction in 1989 for the offence against BG, the Appellant said that, despite being represented by a lawyer, he had pleaded guilty to the offence not because he was guilty, but because it would shorten an otherwise “long process”, and he did not want to interfere with his family who were arriving in Australia. He said that a number of matters in the Agreed Facts put before the Court were untrue. One of those matters was that he had put the boy in a room with a television and a lounge. The Appellant said with respect to this, “That is impossible because that was [an] advertising company and people used to work there in the evening all night”.  
     
      
       
      The Crown and Defence Cases at the Second Trial 
       
      
    63 Before turning to the grounds of appeal, it is convenient to refer to the Crown and defence cases at the second trial.  
     
      
       
      The Crown Case 
       
      
    64 ID was born on 17 March 1969. He gave evidence that, after the family arrived in Australia, they moved around a lot. In the late 1970s, the family moved to Stanmore and he went to Stanmore Public School. In 1979, ID was in Year 4 at Stanmore Primary School (Exhibit C). 
     
      
    65 ID said that, one day while he was living at Stanmore Road, when he was 10 years old, he was with his brothers BD and JD, and with another boy, RM (and perhaps DB) when RM introduced him to the Appellant. RM was a few years older than the D boys. The Appellant lived very close to the D family. The Appellant was driving a blue Ford Fairlane. ID, along with his brothers BD and JD and RM, went with the Appellant to Maroubra to a car park adjacent to a toilet block. RM asked ID to go with him to the toilet. He did and the Appellant followed. In the toilet block, in the presence of RM who masturbated himself, the Appellant “unzipped himself” and placed his penis into ID’s mouth and, whilst holding the boy’s head, thrust backwards and forwards (T16, 1 December 2004). ID said this was the first time this happened and “it is something you don’t forget” (T17, 1 December 2004). This was the first count on the indictment.  
     
      
    66 BD and JD gave evidence at the second trial. They recalled an occasion when they went to the beach at Maroubra. Neither of them witnessed the assault. BD thought the boy, DB, was also there and remembered playing around the rock pool. BD also gave evidence that RM came up to ID and spoke to him, as did the Appellant. However, BD thought at the time that he had successfully stopped his brother, ID, from going to the toilet with the Appellant. 
     
      
    67 The second count occurred at a later time. ID and JD wagged school and went around to the Appellant’s unit at Stanmore. In the bedroom, whilst ID was naked, the Appellant sucked his penis and attempted to insert his fingers into his anus. According to ID, the Appellant said “Go on, it is only my fingers” and ID said “No, you can’t do that”. The Appellant said “Oh well, when can I fuck you, let me fuck you?” and ID said “No, you can’t do that”. After the Appellant finished the act of fellatio, he took a Polaroid photograph of ID naked, lying on the bed (T22-23, 1 December 2004). When ID left, the Appellant gave him and JD some money (T18-26, 1 December 2004).  
     
      
    68 JD gave evidence that he did not witness this assault. He did give evidence that, prior to leaving the unit, the Appellant took a photograph of himself or his brother with a Polaroid camera (T21, 6 December 2004), as well as giving them money. Both ID and JD gave evidence that when they first arrived, the Appellant said to them “my brother mustn’t find out”. The Crown relied upon this as an indicator of impropriety, in the Appellant’s mind, surrounding the visit.  
     
      
    69 BD also gave evidence that, on an occasion other than Count 2, when he went to the Stanmore unit with JD, he saw ID naked on a couch with the Appellant. The Appellant told BD he was “just going to suck him off .. I’m not going to have anal sex with him”. ID did not recall this occasion, nor did JD. 
     
      
    70 There was context evidence given by ID of other uncharged sexual contact between himself and the Appellant, including an occasion when the Appellant tried to kiss him when ID accompanied the Appellant to a cleaning job at Neutral Bay. ID referred to another occasion when he was with the Appellant at one of his cleaning jobs, and the Appellant sought to get ID into a toilet to pretend they would have sexual contact together as a lure to get another boy, DB, into the same situation.  
     
      
    71 Evidence was given that RM declined to make a statement to police and that DB could not be found. 
     
      
    72 The tape recording of the conversation between JD and the Appellant in May 1999 was admitted into evidence at the second trial (Exhibit D). The Appellant was heard to say on the tape that, on an occasion when he was driving the car, ID grabbed the Appellant’s hand and put it on his (ID’s) penis. On another occasion, “in the building at Neutral Bay”, the Appellant put ID’s pubic hair in his wallet. 
     
      
       
      The Defence Case 
       
      
    73 The Appellant did not give evidence or call witnesses in the defence case at the second trial. He denied the allegations to police. His counsel sought to show, through cross-examination, that there were inconsistencies in the evidence of ID and his brothers that were such that the jury would have a reasonable doubt as to the Appellant’s guilt. With respect to the tape recording, defence counsel submitted to the jury that there was nothing on it about the Maroubra or Stanmore incidents, that it was full of laughter and should not be regarded seriously. 
     
      
       
      Ground 1 - The Tape Recording Issue 
       
      
    74 Mr Molomby SC submits that the tape recording of the conversation between JD and the Appellant in May 1999 ought not to have been admitted into evidence in either the first or second trials. To place the arguments into context, it is appropriate to refer to some of the provisions of the Listening Devices Act 1984 (“LD Act”). 
     
      
       
      Relevant Provisions of LD Act

        Inadmissibility of evidence of private conversations when unlawfully obtained 
         
         
          
          (1) Where a private conversation has come to the knowledge of a person as a result, direct or indirect, of the use of a listening device in contravention of section 5: 
          
         
         
          
           
            
            (a) evidence of the conversation, and 
             
             
            (b) evidence obtained as a direct consequence of the conversation so coming to the knowledge of that person, 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
             may not be given by that person in any civil or criminal proceedings (including proceedings for or in connection with the grant of bail). 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (2) Subsection (1) does not render any evidence inadmissible: 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (a) if all of the principal parties to the private conversation concerned consent to the evidence being given, 
             
             
            (b) if the private conversation concerned comes to the knowledge of the person called to give the evidence otherwise than in the manner referred to in that subsection, notwithstanding that the person also obtained knowledge of the conversation in such a manner, 
             
             
            (c) in proceedings for an offence against this Act or the regulations, or 
             
             
            (d) in proceedings for:

             (or in proceedings for or in connection with the grant of bail in any such proceedings) if the court considers that the evidence should be admissible.

      Ruling Admitting Tape into Evidence at First Trial 
       
      
    79 In his judgment admitting the tape (in edited form) into evidence at the first trial, his Honour Judge Woods QC said (judgment, 1 June 2004, pages 4ff): 
     
      
       
        
        “The Defence contention is that the Listening Devices Act prohibits the behaviour which generated the tape recording. Prima facie of course that is so. The Listening Devices Act 1984 imposes a prohibition on what is colloquially called ‘bugging’ people.  
         
         
        Prior to that legislation, an Act in 1967 made it possible for any person who was a party to a conversation to tape record it unbeknownst to the other person. However in 1984 parliament legislated to change that rule, which it was thought allowed an intrusion into personal privacy and permitted excessive interference in private conversations, so that thereafter one person (often a police investigator) might be authorised by warrant to tape record what the other person thought was a private conversation.  
         
         
        The Listening Devices Act of 1984 still stands. It starts with a general prohibition on the recording of private conversations by listening devices, but permits it where in subs 3 there is a principal party to the conversation who consents to the listening device being so used and the recording of the conversation is reasonably necessary for the protection of the lawful interests of that principal party. The effect of that provision is to draw a line, perhaps not always a very clear line, but nonetheless to draw a line between situations where listening devices might be used unfairly, wrongly, and with an excessively and unjustified intrusive effect into private conversations and situations where the bugging is justified by the law. Here the Crown contends that the witness  
        [JD] 
         had been molested as a child by the Accused, and that there was a legitimate interest, a lawful interest, in vindicating his right to justice in relation to the wrongs that had been done to him - wrongs which were criminal and serious - and that there was a reasonable necessity for him to tape the conversation to protect his interests, the tape obviously being a more powerful means of proof than merely the word of one man asserting criminal conduct some decades before without independent proof. 
         
         
        The defence contends that this is not the protection of the lawful interests of  
        [JD] 
         - rather it was an exercise in extortion. He ended up taking some $1750 off the Accused. In effect, the exercise was nothing less than blackmail. Therefore, justification provided in s 5(3)(1)(b) of the Listening Devices Act, is not operative in this case. The taping was unlawful, and its use in court should be excluded. It should be regarded as unlawful, in contravention of the Act, and it should have no part in this trial. 
         
         
        In my view it was reasonably necessary for  
        [JD] 
         to protect his lawful interests by making the tape recording. On the evidence of his statements, which I accept as probably true,  
        [JD] 
         had been molested as a child by the Accused. At a later time in life he determined to do something about this to bring the Offender to justice. As well, of course, this would have meant that offences by the Accused against other persons were also bought to light, but that does not stop, in my view, the application of s 5(3)(1)(b) to the witness in this case.  
        [JD] 
         had a lawful interest in vindicating his right as a child not to be sexually assaulted. In making the tape, what he was seeking to do was to protect his personal lawful interests in having justice done. Tape recording the Accused without the latter's knowledge was, it seems to me, reasonably necessary for the protection of that interest. The formula ‘reasonably necessary’ is not an absolute form of words. One bears in mind the purpose of this legislation which is to strike a balance between legitimate interests of privacy and the need to allow for the proper protection of legitimate personal interests. 
         
         
        There may be many ways that a person could protect a ‘lawful interest’. It is not necessary in my view, or appropriate, that s 5(3)(1)(b) be interpreted in such a fashion that the tape recording or the listening device use must be seen as the only possible way that a right could be vindicated. For example, presumably, the witness might have gone to a television station and contributed to a program about sexual assault. He might have joined a political party and urged a Royal Commission into the subject focussing on the Accused. He might have gone to the police and sought to have the police interview the Accused. All these things are possibilities. Nonetheless, in the context of this legislation, it seems to me that the conduct of the witness was lawful. Vindication of an injustice against oneself does not always require immediate resort to the police, although the creation of the tape was shortly followed by the witness taking it to the police by whom it has been used in the process of law which brings us here. Furthermore, it seems to me, the exercise was not rendered unlawful by  
        [JD] 
         taking money. It was, on the evidence before me, I find, not the witness' idea to demand money - rather it was the Accused's idea, having become aware through the clicking of the machine that he was being taped, to offer money to keep the secret of the abuse. It was not, in my view, an exercise in extortion. The taking of the money was simply an opportunistic event that occurred after the relevant facts had occurred.  
         
         
        In my view, as I say, the tape recording was not unlawful under the Listening Devices Act. I do not see it to be unlawful in any other way. Moreover, while large parts of it will need to be edited out, substantial parts of it which will be relevant, and admissible are important evidence in the Crown case. It has considerable probative evidence in relation to all counts which I will allow to be tried together in this indictment. I do not see any unfair prejudice arising against the Accused as a result of this exercise. To the extent that the tape recording has probative force, no doubt it will have an effect on the minds of the jury in persuading them of the validity of the Crown case. That of course is a matter for the jury to estimate, but I anticipate that it will have strong probative impact. I do not see it as being unfairly prejudicial. The words of the Accused, apparently spoken to the witness, were words which he volunteered in response to questions from a friend. The witness  
        [JD] 
         not acting as an agent of the police. He had not in fact been to the police at that stage, notwithstanding that he had a view to the ultimate use of the tape by police. Subject to editing, I will allow that tape to be evidence in the trial.” 
        
       
       
      Ruling Admitting Tape into Evidence at Second Trial 
       
      
    80 For the purposes of the second trial, objection was taken to the tender of the tape recording. In the course of a judgment delivered on 24 August 2004, his Honour Judge Woods QC admitted the tape recording for the purpose of the second trial (judgment, 24 August 2004, pages 8-11): 
     
      
       
        
        “Now as to the listening devices material, as I have said there is material which is before me as exhibit 1F which the Crown seeks to lead. This is a transcript of part of tapes secretly made by  
        [JD] 
        : in short, the part of that that relates to  
        [ID]  
        may be led. Objection is taken to the recording as being unlawful contrary to sections 5 and 7 of the Listening Devices Act. However, that statute says that that illegality will not arise if the tape recording was made in circumstances where it did not go beyond what was necessary for the protection of a person's lawful interests. 
         
         
        The protection of a lawful interest may encompass both business and personal matters. Obviously a person has a lawful interest in vindicating his own reputation, or in ensuring due process of law against an oppressor. So it is with close family members as with individual persons. For example a mother who secretly tape records an admission of a person who committed a sexual assault upon a child would undoubtedly have a lawful interest qua the child. This would be so even though it was not the mother who had been molested, but the child. A similar fact situation to this arose in Western Australia in the case of  
        Ferry v Regina 
         (2003 Western Australian Supreme Court). That case involved different legislation but exemplifies a pertinent fact situation. 
         
         
        The same principle would apply in my view with brother and brother. Society and the law recognise this bond as special, as giving rise to important common interests. When one brother is harmed it may injure a brother in reputation. Commonly one brother will feel motivated by a natural feeling to speak up for or to defend a brother. Brothers carry a significant common genetic inheritance, which motivates brothers to seek to maximise the continuing longevity, prosperity and fecundity of brothers. Darwinian and evolution aside, statute law recognises that brothers may expect to benefit under some inheritance arrangements. For example under that Family Provision Act, being a brother of someone may allow a certain interest which the law recognises. 
        
       
       
        
        Here the secret tape was made by  
        [JD] 
        .  
        [JD] 
         made the tape partly to protect his own lawful interests (a jury recently convicted the accused of offences against  
        [JD] 
        ) and partly to protect the interests of his brothers  
        [BD] 
         and  
        [ID] 
        . In my view  
        [JD’s] 
         tape recording of the accused's alleged admissions relating to  
        [ID] 
         are not inadmissible under the Listening Devices Act sections 5 and 7.  
        [JD]  
        had a lawful interest in vindicating  
        [ID] 
        . The law recognises that one brother has a lawful interest in taking steps to protect the emotional integrity, the feelings and the reputation of a brother and to assist in the legitimate prosecution of a possible offender. The tape recording was a much better alternative than resort to violent measures, an extra legal approach not uncommon in child molestation cases. In the circumstances, the steps taken by  
        [JD]  
        did not go beyond what was reasonably necessary for him to protect his lawful interest. 
         
         
        [JD’s] 
         own disordered life meant that in the real world it is unlikely  
         
        that his bare word (or the bare words of his brothers, or even all of them) would have sufficed to convince police or a jury of their allegations going back, as they did, more than several decades. The exercise of tape recording was not undertaken by proxy for the police - contrast the situation in  
        Regina v Swaffield 
        , and  
        Regina v Pavic 
          
        [(1998) 192 CLR 159] 
        , the famous High Court decisions. 
         
         
        On the contrary the exercise was undertaken independently of police. The material produced relating to the accused was highly probative of an improper sexual connection between the accused and the child  
        [ID] 
        . The term ‘guilty passion’ may not be fashionable in the recent criminal jurisprudence of sexual assaults against children, but this is a case where it might be thought notably apt. An apparent admission by an accused of having taken a pubic hair from an eleven year old boy and kept  
        [it]  
        in his wallet is likely to be viewed by a jury as having strong probative value of an improper sexual relationship. Now as to precisely which parts of the tape recording may be admitted, the material set out in exhibit VD1F will (subject to any further exclusions if I am persuaded that they are appropriate) be permitted.” 
        
       
      
    81 The Court was informed that this judgment was given for the purpose of a trial in August 2004 which led to a hung jury. The Crown and counsel for the Appellant agreed that the judgment ought be treated as the relevant ruling concerning the objection to the tape recording for the purpose of the second trial in December 2004. 
     
      
       
      Submissions on Appeal 
       
      
    82 Mr Molomby SC submits that an unusual and central feature of both trials was the admission into evidence of the tape recording and transcript of the conversation in May 1999 between JD and the Appellant. Objection was taken to the tender of the recording on the basis that it was unlawfully recorded, and that its recording did not fall within any exception provided under s.5 LD Act. At the first trial, the learned trial Judge held that the recording fell within s.5(3)(b)(i) LD Act in that the recording of the conversation was “reasonably necessary for the protection of the lawful interests” of JD. A similar ruling was made at the second trial.  
     
      
    83 With respect to both the first and second trials, the Appellant’s ground of appeal contends that the learned trial Judge erred in law in admitting evidence of the recorded conversation. Mr Molomby SC submits that it was not open to the Court to conclude that the conversation fell within s.5(3)(b)(i) LD Act, given that JD’s purpose in recording the conversation was to extract admissions of sexual offences allegedly committed by the Appellant upon a number of males, including JD, many years previously. 
     
      
    84 The Appellant relies upon the decision of this Court in R v Le (2004) 60 NSWLR 108. Mr Molomby SC submits that JD went about to “set up” the Appellant and lure him into making alleged admissions relating to conduct concerning numerous people. About a week prior to the recording, JD had purchased a tape recorder from a Dick Smith store and had contacted the Appellant and had consensual sex with him. One week after that, JD recorded the conversation. He did so to procure admissions by the Appellant in order to take the tape to police.  
     
      
    85 It was the Appellant’s contention that JD recorded the conversations in order to extort money from the Appellant. JD did not take the tape immediately to the police. It was handed to Senior Constable Blackmore on 19 July 1999, even though it had been recorded in about May 1999. JD did receive money from the Appellant prior to taking the tape to police, although the reasons for the Appellant giving money to JD were disputed issues at the trial. 
     
      
    86 Mr Molomby SC submits that the term “lawful interests” in s.5 LD Act must be judged objectively, and must be an actual lawful interest existing at the time of the conversation: Violi v Berrivale Orchards Limited (2000) 99 FCR 580 at 585-6; Amalgamated Television Services Pty Limited v Marsden [2000] NSWCA 167 at paragraphs 20-23. It was submitted that, viewed objectively, JD did not have an existing lawful interest at the time of recording the conversation with the Appellant which was reasonably necessary to protect by means of the recording. There were no court proceedings on foot. JD had not earlier approached the police with allegations of sexual assault. There was no earlier conversation with the Appellant which JD wished to corroborate. It was submitted that JD’s purpose in making the recording was to create evidence. Further, Mr Molomby SC stressed that the conversation related almost entirely to other persons, and not JD. 
     
      
    87 Mr Molomby SC emphasised that, to fall within s.5(3)(b)(i), the recording must be reasonably necessary for the protection of the lawful interests of the principal party. The provision speaks of the “protection”, and not the advancement or vindication, of the lawful interests of that party. He submitted that the use of the term “protection” qualified the provision so that it was confined to a defensive use, including a defensive use in current or possible future litigation. He submitted that this construction did not accommodate the circumstances of the present case. Here, JD recorded the conversation with the Appellant, on the findings of the trial Judge, for the purpose of gathering evidence against the Appellant with respect to past criminal conduct committed against JD and his brothers, BD and ID. Mr Molomby SC submitted that the concept of bringing the Appellant to justice by such means did not constitute a defensive or protective activity of the type caught by s.5(3)(b)(i) LD Act.  
     
      
    88 The Crown submits that the trial Judge was correct in finding that the recording came within s.5(3)(b)(i) LD Act. In this respect, the Crown submitted that his Honour applied the principles in R v Le as emerged, in particular, from the judgment of Adams J, with whom Hulme J agreed. The Crown submitted that the following propositions emerged from that decision, with application to this appeal: 
     
      
       
      (a) JD had a legal right to engage the Appellant in conversation; 
       
       
      (b) JD had a legal right to repeat the conversation to another person, with or without the permission of the Appellant; 
       
       
      (c) the recording of the conversation simply provided evidence, thereby making it difficult for the Appellant to deny the truth of JD’s account; 
       
       
      (d) a  
      “lawful interest”  
      includes JD being labelled as a liar and a fabricator of a false conversation - it was unnecessary to go so far as to require that JD demonstrate that he might be charged with making a false allegation. 
       
      
    89 The Crown submits that the Appellant’s contention that there was no evidence from JD regarding his “lawful interests” is wrong. There was evidence before his Honour as to JD’s purpose and motive in making the recording, which his Honour accepted for the purpose of the ruling on admissibility of the evidence. This evidence was directly relevant to the question of “lawful interest” under s.5(3)(b)(i) LD Act. The Crown submitted that even if, for argument sake, the recording had not produced admissions of sexual misconduct towards JD (as opposed to others), he would still have had a lawful interest at the time when the recording took place. 
     
      
    90 The Crown submits that the trial Judge, in fact, took an unnecessarily restrictive view, favourable to the Appellant, of what constituted JD’s “lawful interest”. The Crown submits that JD also had a “lawful interest” in vindicating the criminal wrongs committed upon his brothers just as, in R v Le, Ms Le had a lawful interest in protecting herself from being called a liar by Mr Ranse.  
     
      
    91 Insofar as the Appellant submits in this Court that the purpose of the recording was to extract admissions of under-age sexual conduct so as to blackmail the Appellant for money, the Crown points to the finding made by the trial Judge (as set in paragraph 79 above) which rejected this argument for the Appellant. The Crown points out that, during the course of the first trial, there was no application made by the Appellant to the trial Judge to revisit his earlier ruling on this point. Nor was it argued on appeal that the finding of his Honour Judge Woods QC concerning JD’s purpose and motive in recording the conversation was not open to the trial Judge. 
     
      
    92 The Crown points to the relevance of the tape recording, noting that no submission to the contrary had been made in the District Court or in this Court. The recording that was ultimately admitted contained admissions by the Appellant that he had sex with JD and BD. The Appellant was heard to say on the tape words such as “it was wrong”, “you don’t think and then you just did it”, “I’m sick myself and do you know why I’m sick too? Because thinking about what I did wrong …” (page 33). 
     
      
    93 With respect to JD, the Crown submits that the tape recording rebutted the Appellant’s assertion that JD had not been to the Wilson’s Fabrics Building in Waterloo (page 3). The jury was able to listen to the tape to assess the veracity of the Appellant’s claim that he was afraid of JD who was allegedly blackmailing him for money and threatening to falsely accuse him of sex with under-age boys. 
     
      
    94 In relation to BD, the Crown submits that the Appellant was heard on the recording to admit that he had sex with BD when the latter was 14 years old (pages 4, 15-16), that “BD was in love with me”, “it was wrong” (page 12), “I didn’t force him or anything. I was by myself, living by myself. I was lonely. I needed company … He came, he, he was so nice to me … I didn’t want to damage any boy … but he’s the one who wanted to be with me … you don’t plan … on purpose to do things wrong. Things happen …”, “I was in love with BD. I was in love with BD”.  
     
      
    95 Given the ruling of the trial Judge at both trials, the Crown notes that it was not necessary for his Honour to consider s.138 Evidence Act 1995. The Crown submits, however, that if the trial Judge was wrong in his construction and application of s.5 LD Act, the evidence was nonetheless admissible under s.7(2)(b) LD Act and/or s.138 Evidence Act 1995. The Crown submits that this was not a case of an unjustified “bugging” by a third party of a conversation of two persons who were both ignorant that a recording was being made. Rather, JD sought to vindicate his rights and those of others. The trial Judge found the evidence had considerable probative value and saw no unfair prejudice to the Appellant. The alleged offences were very serious and the evidence was important.  
     
      
    96 The Crown submits that the LD Act only prohibits the recording of a private conversation: s.5(1). It does not prohibit the use of such a recording: R v Eade (2001) 118 A Crim R 449 at 460 [58]. Since the recording was made by JD, the Crown submitted that it could be used in the course of legal proceedings: s.7(2)(b) LD Act.  
     
      
       
      The Decision in  
      R v Le 
       
      
    97 The decision of this Court in R v Le was the focus of submissions on the hearing of this appeal, as it was during argument in the District Court. The relevant question posed by a District Court Judge under s.5B Criminal Appeal Act 1912 in R v Le was as follows (at 110 [5]): 
     
      
       
        
        “Did I err in law in holding, in the circumstances of these alleged offences and the factual findings as to the appellant’s conduct, that the appellant had not established the statutory defence contained in section 5(3)(b)(i) of the Act?” 
        
       
      
    98 To place the question posed for determination in R v Le in its factual context, it is appropriate to recite the following background as contained in the judgment of Giles JA at 110-111 [6]-[7]: 
     
      
       
        
        “The appellant was a friend of Mr Phuong Ngo, who had been charged with and was subsequently convicted of the murder of Mr John Newman. The appellant claimed that in April 1998 Mr Albert Ranse told her that he, Ranse, had shot Newman. According to the appellant, Ranse told her that she could never use what he told her against him because it would be her word against his.  
         
         
        In co-operation with a friend who worked for Channel 9, on 21 February 1999 video cameras were fitted into the appellant's car, one in the back of the car and the other in the dashboard, and a microphone was attached to the appellant's jacket. On that day and on the next day the appellant picked Ranse up in her car. The jacket was placed over the back of the driver's seat, and when they left the car the appellant took the jacket with her. Unknown to Ranse, his conversations with the appellant in the car and when they left the car were recorded, as to the conversations within the car in images and as to all the conversations in sound. The evidence in the Crown case included videos containing the images and sound.” 
        
       
      
    99 Giles JA said with respect to the question posed at 118 [47]: 
     
      
       
        
        “The judge found that each of the matters relied on for lawful interests had been established on the balance of probabilities. One was to protect the appellant's credibility generally. The second was to support her credibility if she had to give evidence ‘in a Court proceeding about the matter’. The third was to protect herself against exposure to ‘being charged with making false allegations against other people about matters of considerable seriousness’. It had then to be asked whether recording the conversations was reasonably necessary for the protection of the interests. Different minds could give different answers in the application of reasonable necessity. I am quite unable to conclude, however, that only an affirmative answer was possible. Protection of credibility generally or in the event of giving evidence plainly did not dictate an affirmative answer. Concern to have a supporting record before making allegations is of more significance, but in my opinion it was open to the judge to regard it as insufficient.” 
        
       
      
    100 Adams J at 124-126 concluded that it was open to find, in the circumstances of that case, that the statutory exclusion in s.5(3)(b)(i) applied. His Honour observed: 
     
      
       
      (a) Ms Le had a legal right to attempt to engage Mr Ranse in conversation (at 124 [83]); 
       
       
      (b) the likelihood that Mr Ranse would deny the conversation was obvious (at 125 [83]); 
       
       
      (c) Ms Le necessarily had a lawful interest in protecting herself from the risk of the accusation that she had fabricated the conversation (at 125 [83]); 
       
       
      (d) the avoidance of being labelled a liar is an important lawful interest, especially in the context of a criminal investigation, and it is clear that recording the conversation was the only practicable mode of preventing or refuting such an allegation (at 125 [83]); 
       
       
      (e) it is obvious that a participant to a conversation has a legal right to repeat it to another person, with or without the permission of the other participant - the recording of the conversation simply provides evidence which makes it difficult, if not impossible, for the other participant to deny the truth of the person’s account (at 125 [84]); 
       
       
      (f) it is not the case that the mere intention of making an irrefutable record of a conversation to which one is a party will, without more, satisfy the section - the circumstances in which the recording occurs will always be relevant to the determination of whether there is a reasonable necessity for doing so (at 125 [84]); 
       
       
      (g) it is erroneous to approach the issue posed by s.5(3) LD Act on the basis that a determination is required whether conducting the conversation that was recorded was reasonably necessary for the protection of Ms Le’s lawful interests, as distinct from asking whether the recording was so necessary (at 125-126 [85]). 
       
      
    101 Hulme J said at 124 [79]: 
     
      
       
        
        “So far as question 3 is concerned, I agree with Adams J that this question should be answered, ‘Yes’. I agree also with his Honour's reasons insofar as they relate to the particular circumstances in which the appellant found or placed herself in this case. It is unnecessary to go further and I have grave doubts whether as a general proposition, the recording of a conversation by a party to it in order to ensure there is an irrefutable record of it could be regarded as protected by s 5(3)(b)(i).” 
        
       
       
      Consideration of Submissions Concerning First Ground  
       
      
    102 It is appropriate to bear in mind that the Appellant’s first ground, with respect to both trials, contends that the learned trial Judge erred in law in admitting evidence of a clandestinely recorded conversation. This ground involves two steps:(a) that the recording of the conversation breached s.5(1) LD Act and that the recording did not fall within any statutory exemption within s.5(2) or (3) and, in particular, s.5(3)(b)(i) LD Act as found by the trial Judge; 
     
      
    (b) that, if the above submission is correct, the recording was unlawfully obtained and ought not be admitted under s.138 Evidence Act 1995.  
     
      
       
      
    103 At both trials, his Honour Judge Woods QC held that the recording fell within the statutory exemption in s.5(3)(b)(i) LD Act and, accordingly, was not unlawful. It was not necessary for his Honour to determine the argument that the recording should be admitted under s.138 in the event that he found that it had been made in contravention of s.5(1) LD Act. To succeed on the first ground with respect to both trials, it will be necessary for the Appellant to demonstrate, as the ground states, that it was erroneous to admit the recording into evidence.  
     
      
      Construing the LD Act 
      
    104 To resolve the first ground of appeal, it is necessary to construe s.5(3)(b)(i) LD Act. 105 In Miller v TCN Channel Nine (1988) 36 A Crim R 92 at 94, Finlay J observed that the LD Act was introduced to establish safeguards against an unjustified invasion of privacy that could be occasioned by the use of electronic surveillance. The mischief which the Act addresses is the protection of privacy: Violi at 522 [21]; Lawrence v NSW Police Service (2004) 144 A Crim R 396 at 403 [45].106 The issue of construction should be approached in accordance with the principles in Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] 194 CLR 355, where McHugh, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ said at 384 [78]: 
     
      
       
        
        “However, the duty of a court is to give the words of a statutory provision the meaning that the legislature is taken to have intended them to have. Ordinarily, that meaning (the legal meaning) will correspond with the grammatical meaning of the provision. But not always. The context of the words, the consequences of a literal or grammatical construction, the purpose of the statute or the canons of construction [for example, the presumption that, in the absence of unmistakable and unambiguous language, the legislature has not intended to interfere with basic rights, freedoms or immunities:  
        Coco v The Queen 
         (1994) 179 CLR 427 at 437] may require the words of a legislative provision to be read in a way that does not correspond with the literal or grammatical meaning.” 
        
       
      
    107 Interference with privacy is relevant when construing a statute which, in some circumstances, permits such interference: Taciak v Commissioner of Australian Federal Police (1995) 59 FCR 285 at 299. 108 It is necessary to bear in mind that the LD Act creates an elaborate structure whereby application may be made to a Judge of the Supreme Court for the issue of a warrant under Part 4 of the Act. The issue of a warrant by a Judge under s.16 LD Act involves the exercise of administrative and not judicial power: Love v Attorney General for NSW (1990) 169 CLR 307 at 321. A warrant under the LD Act authorises an invasion of privacy of the persons whose conversations are to be recorded and, in some cases, authorises trespass upon their property or the property of others: Commissioner of Police v Barbaro (2001) 51 NSWLR 419 at 422 [17]. 109 Unlike a search warrant, a warrant under the LD Act will be directed to law enforcement officers who will act upon it in conditions of secrecy: Commissioner of Police v Barbaro at 422 [17]. For this reason, s.17 LD Act requires the service of a notice upon the Attorney General that application is to be made for a s.16 warrant before such application is made. Because the nature of the activities authorised by a warrant precludes notice to the individual whose privacy will be affected by action taken under the warrant, the Act selects the Attorney General, as a member of the executive government, as the person to be served and to be afforded an opportunity to be heard in relation to the granting of the warrant: s.17(2) LD Act; Love v Attorney General for NSW at 320-321. 110 Section 16 provides for the matters to be established before a warrant may be issued. Section 5(1) does not apply to the use of a listening device pursuant to a warrant granted under Part 4: s.5(2)(a) LD Act. This is the principle statutory exemption to the prohibition upon the recording of private conversations contained in s.5(1) of the Act.111 The construction of s.5(3)(b)(i) LD Act should be considered in the statutory context whereby application may be made to a Judge of the Court by (usually) a representative of the NSW Police for a warrant under s.16 of the Act after notice has been given to the Attorney General and where, if a warrant issues, a report must be provided under s.19 LD Act to the issuing Judge and to the Attorney General with specified information concerning the use which was made of a listening device under the warrant. These statutory steps emphasise the manner to which the LD Act provides an integrated scheme for controlling infringements of privacy: R v Haddad and Treglia (2000) 116 A Crim R 312 at 327 [75].112 From time to time, warrants are sought and issued under the LD Act to permit the recording of a conversation between the alleged victim and alleged offender with respect to sexual assault offences which are said to have been committed years before the proposed recording, the scenario which arises in the present appeal. 
     
      
      The Breadth of s.5(3)(b)(i) LD Act 
      
    113 In choosing the terms included in s.5(3)(b)(i) LD Act, the legislature has not been prescriptive in confining the statutory exemption to specified classes. The words used in the subsection are capable of being applied to a range of situations with differing outcomes. In Violi, Branson J observed at 521 [14] that “the intended ambit of the conduct intended to be excluded by section 5(3)(b)(i) from the operation of section 5(3)(b) is not readily identified”. In Scanruby Pty Ltd v Caltex Petroleum Pty Ltd [2000] NSWIRComm 89, Peterson J referred to a number of the authorities and noted, at [40], that “those observations illustrate the potential breadth of the phrase ‘lawful interests’ in the exclusion from the prohibition on relevant use of a listening device”. In R v Le, Giles JA at 118 [47] observed that “different minds could give different answers in the application of reasonable necessity”. 114 However, it is necessary to view the broad words in s.5(3)(b)(i) LD Act, against the background of the statute generally. The LD Act commences with a prohibition upon the use of a listening device to record or listen to a private conversation, whether by a party to that conversation or otherwise: s.5(1). The primary exception to this statutory prohibition involves the use of a listening device pursuant to a warrant under Part 4 of the LD Act, or pursuant to an authority under a law of the Commonwealth or another circumstance specified in s.5(2) of the Act. 115 A further layer of statutory exceptions are to be found in s.5(3), with this class applicable only where a principal party to the conversation consents to the recording. It is necessary to bear in mind that s.5(3)(b)(i) constitutes an exception to the general statutory prohibition on use of a listening device, where the primary exception permits recording of conversations under warrant. There is a strong argument that the words of s.5(3)(b)(i) ought be closely confined to avoid undermining the primary purpose of the LD Act. An undue willingness to include a multitude of differing circumstances within this statutory exception may serve to encourage persons to make a covert recording of a conversation rather than (in the present context), comply with the primary object of the Act by bringing the matter to the attention of relevant law enforcement authorities so that application may be made for a warrant to lawfully record a conversation. 
     
      
      “ 
      Reasonably Necessary 
      ” 
      
    116 The term “reasonably necessary” appears in s.5(3)(b)(i) LD Act. The word “necessary” is capable of a wide range of meanings. Dictionaries indicate that such meanings include “indispensable”, “requisite”, “needed”, “convenient”, “appropriate” and “essential”. The term “essential” is the strongest or the highest meaning to be attributed to “necessary”: Elcham v Commissioner of Police [2001] NSWSC 614 at paragraph 48. 117 In this Court, Mr Molomby SC accepted (T7.36, 18 May 2006) as the proper construction of this term that “necessary” in s.5(3)(b)(i) means appropriate, but not essential: State Drug Crime Commission v Chapman (1988) 12 NSWLR 447 at 452; Pelechowski v Registrar of Court of Appeal (NSW) (1999) 198 CLR 435 at 452. On this basis, it is sufficient that the recording of a conversation is reasonably appropriate (rather than essential) for the protection of the lawful interests of the principal party.  
     
      
    118 The presence of the word “reasonably” qualifying the word “necessary” imports an objective test. Reasonable necessity is to be judged objectively upon bases or grounds that exist at the time of the recording: Marsden v Amalgamated Television Services Pty Limited [2000] NSWSC 465 at [17]-[18], [23]; Amalgamated Television Services Pty Limited v Marsden at [20]-[22]; Violi at 586 [23]. 
     
      
       
      “ 
      Protection 
      ” 
       
      
    119 I have referred earlier to the Appellant’s submissions concerning the significance of the word “protection” in s.5(3)(b)(i) LD Act. 120 According to the Macquarie Dictionary, the meaning of the noun “protection” includes “preservation from injury or harm”. The Oxford English Dictionary definition includes “shelter, defence, or preservation from harm, danger, or evil”. In Udino v Aldo (1998) 16 NSWCCR 418, her Honour Judge Truss accepted this meaning of the word “protection” in the section in concluding (at [19]) that “the applicant’s lawful interests were in need of ‘defence from harm, danger and evil’ at the time when the recording was made and that the use of the device was reasonably necessary for the protection of his lawful interests”. This meaning seems apt given the statutory context in which the word appears. 
     
      
      “ 
      Lawful Interests” 
       of that Principal Party 
      
    121 The word “lawful” can mean, simply, permitted, that is something which can be done without an infraction of the law (for example, a lawful trade), or it may mean something which is supported by the law (for example, lawful authority) or it may connote the quality of being legally enforceable (for example, a lawful demand which can be enforced by action): Taikato v The Queen (1996) 186 CLR 454 at 488.122 According to the Macquarie Dictionary, the meaning of the word “interest” includes: 
     
      
       
        
        “…  
        
       
      
    5. A business, cause, or the like, in which a number of persons are interested.  
     
      
       
        
       
      
    6. A share in the ownership of property, in a commercial or financial undertaking, or the like. 
     
      
       
        
       
      
    7. Any right of ownership in property, commercial undertakings, etc. 
     
      
       
        
       
      
    8. A number or group of persons, or a party, having a common interest: the banking interest. 
     
      
       
        
       
      
    9. Something in which one has an interest, as of ownership, advantage, attention, etc. 
     
      
       
        
       
      
    10. The relation of being affected by something in respect of advantage or detriment: an arbitrator having no interest in the outcome. 
     
      
       
        
       
      
    11. Benefit or advantage: to have one’s own interest in mind. 
     
      
       
        
       
      
    12. Regard for one’s own advantage or profit; self-interest: rival interest. 
     
      
       
        
         
        …” 
        
       
      
    123 The Oxford English Dictionary includes the following definitions for the noun “interest”: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “1. The relation of being objectively concerned in something, by having a right or title to, a claim upon, or a share in.  
         
        
       
      
    (a) The fact or relation of being legally concerned; legal concerned in a thing; esp. right or title to property, or to some of the uses or benefits pertaining to property.  
     
      
       
        
         
          
          … 
           
          
         
        
       
      
    (c) right or title to a share in something; share, part. 
     
      
       
        
         
          
          … 
           
          
         
        
       
      
    (e) esp. a pecuniary share or stake in, or claim upon anything; the relation of being a part-owner of property, a shareholder or bondholder in a commercial or financial undertaking, or the like. 
     
      
       
        
         
          
         
        2(a) the relation of being concerned or affected in respect of advantage or detriment; esp. an advantageous relation of this kind. 
         
        
       
      
    (b) that which is to or for the advantage of anyone; good, benefit, profit, advantage. 
     
      
       
        
         
        …” 
         
        
       
      
    124 In Violi, at 586 [28], Branson J said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Unassisted by authority, it seems to me that ‘lawful interests’ are to be distinguished from ‘legal interests’. I do not consider that section 5(3)(b)(i) called for a legal interest in the sense of a legal right, title, duty or liability. Rather I consider that ‘lawful interests’ within the meaning of the paragraph are interests which are not unlawful. The expressions ‘legitimate interests’ or ‘interests conforming to law’, in my view, convey similar meanings to the intended meaning of ‘lawful interests’ in the paragraph.” 
        
       
      
    125 A perusal of the cases reveals that, in some cases, a finding has been made that a recording is reasonably necessary for the protection of the lawful interests of the relevant party and, in other cases, a finding to the contrary has been made. As might be expected, the finding depends upon the circumstances of a particular case: Miller v TCN Channel 9 at 104-105; T v Medical Board of South Australia (1992) 58 SASR 382 at 399; R v Smith and Turner (1994) 63 SASR 123 at 128; Public Trustee v Alvaro (Supreme Court of South Australia, Legoe J, 19 July 1995, unreported, BC9502314 at pages 26-29); Udino v Aldo at [16]-[19]; Marsden v Amalgamated Television Services Pty Limited at [18]-[23]; Violi at 524-525 [32]-[33]; Scanruby at [40]-[48]; Amalgamated Television Services Pty Limited v Marsden at [19]-[23]; See v Hardman [2002] NSWSC 234 at [15]-[19].126 Mr Molomby SC relied upon Violi in his submissions (see paragraph 86 above) and did not contend that Branson J’s construction of the term “lawful interests” was wrong. It was his submission that the interests of JD identified by the trial Judge in this case were not capable of constituting “lawful interests” for the purpose of s.5(3)(b)(i) LD Act. Given the statutory context in which the term appears in the subsection, as an exception to the prohibition on recording in s.5(1), it may be that Branson J’s construction of the term is too wide. Given the limited submissions made for the purpose of this appeal, however, it is neither appropriate nor necessary to express a concluded view on this issue. Is Error Established with Respect to the First Ground? 127 The first ground of appeal asserts that the learned trial Judge erred in law in admitting evidence of the recorded conversation at both trials. 128 In approaching the first ground of appeal, it is necessary to bear in mind the findings made by his Honour Judge Woods QC when ruling at the first trial that the tape recording was admissible. The principal argument in the District Court on this issue involved the Crown submission that it was reasonably necessary for JD to record the conversation to assist in bringing the Appellant to justice and to create a reliable and independent record of his admissions and the defence submission that it was nothing of the sort, but rather an exercise in extortion and blackmail by JD.129 The trial Judge made factual findings in favour of the Crown submission and rejected the defence submission. 130 His Honour found that JD’s purpose and motive in recording the conversation was, among other things, to bring the Appellant to justice for his criminal acts committed against JD and his brothers. His Honour did not accept that, at the time when the recording was made, JD’s purpose and motive included a desire to obtain money from the Appellant by way of extortion or blackmail. 131 This Court is bound by findings of fact of the trial Judge unless they were not open on the evidence or unless error is shown in the sense referred to in House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 499 at 504: R v O’Donoghue (1988) 34 A Crim R 397 at 401; Kardoulias v R (2005) 159 A Crim R 252 at 265 [56]. To the extent that the submissions for the Appellant in support of the first ground assert that the trial Judge’s findings concerning JD’s purpose and motive in recording the conversation were not open or were infected by error, I reject the submission. Clearly, it was open to the trial Judge to make the finding which he did. 132 The Appellant’s submissions on appeal then concentrated upon the construction of the words used in s.5(3)(b)(i) LD Act and their application to the facts as found by the trial Judge. Mr Molomby SC did not take the Court to any particular part of the judgments admitting the recordings at the first or second trial, for the purpose of contending that his Honour had misdirected himself as to the meaning of particular words in the statute. Rather, he submitted that the learned Judge had not given proper attention to the use of the word “protection” in the subsection and that, as a matter of law, the facts as found by the trial Judge were incapable of falling within the terms of s.5(3)(b)(i) LD Act. 133 In substance, Mr Molomby SC submitted that the trial Judge erred in law in concluding that the facts as found by him were capable of falling within the terms of s.5(3)(b)(i) LD Act. An ultimate finding of fact, even in the absence of a misdirection, may reveal error of law if the primary facts found are necessarily within or outside a statutory description and a contrary decision has been made: Australian Gas Light Company v Valuer General (1940) 40 SR(NSW) 126 at 138; Azzopardi v Tasman UEB Industries Limited (1985) 4 NSWLR 139 at 156. 134 An argument to a similar effect was considered in R v Le. There, a finding had been made at first instance that, on the factual findings made, s.5(3)(b)(i) LD Act did not apply to the circumstances in which Ms Le recorded the conversation with Mr Ranse. The issue for the Court of Criminal Appeal was whether error of law was demonstrated in this finding. There was a division amongst the Judges comprising the Court of Criminal Appeal concerning the correct application of s.5(3)(b)(i) LD Act to the facts as found in that case. It appears that limited consideration was given to the construction of the subsection as it was not strictly necessary to consider the third question on the stated case, because of the answer to an earlier question. The present appeal has raised more starkly, and in a different factual context, the proper construction of s.5(3)(b)(i) LD Act. The judgment in R v Le does not refer to a number of decisions concerning the construction of s.5(3)(b)(i) LD Act, including Marsden before Levine J and the Court of Appeal and Violi.135 The findings of the Trial Judge at the first trial, that it was reasonably necessary that JD record the conversation with the Appellant to protect his lawful interests, included the following findings: 
     
      
       
      (a) JD had a lawful interest in vindicating his right as a child not be sexually assaulted; 
       
       
      (b) in making the tape, JD was seeking to protect his personal lawful interests in having justice done; 
       
       
      (c) the formula  
      “reasonably necessary” 
       is not an absolute form of words - it is not necessary that recording of the conversation be seen as the only possible way that a right may be vindicated; 
       
       
      (d) it was possible that JD might have gone to the police and sought to have the police interview the Appellant - vindication of an injustice against oneself does not always require immediate resort to the police although, in this case, the creation of the tape was followed shortly by JD taking it to the police, who used it in the process of law. 
      
    136 The relevant findings of the trial Judge at the second trial included the following findings: 
     
      
       
      (a) the protection of a lawful interest may encompass both business and personal matters; 
       
       
      (b) a person may have a lawful interest in vindicating his own reputation, or in ensuring due process of law against an oppressor; 
       
       
      (c) it is likewise with close family members - the same principle would apply as between brothers, where a special bond is recognised giving rise to important common interests; 
       
       
      (d) when one brother is harmed, it may injure a brother’s reputation; 
       
       
      (e) the tape was made by JD partly to protect his own lawful interests and party to protect the interests of his brothers, BD and ID; 
       
       
      (f) JD had a lawful interest in vindicating ID - the law recognises that one brother has a lawful interest in taking steps to protect the emotional integrity, the feelings and the reputation of a brother and to assist in the legitimate prosecution of a possible offender; 
       
       
      (g) JD’s own disordered life meant that it was unlikely that his bare word (or the bare words of his brothers, or even all of them) would have sufficed to convince police or a jury of their allegations going back decades. 
      
    137 The question raised by the first ground of appeal is whether the findings of the trial Judge mean that, as a matter of law, JD’s recording of a conversation with the Appellant in May 1999 was not capable of falling within the terms of the subsection. 138 In considering whether it was open to the trial Judge, in the circumstances of the present case, to find that the recording was “reasonably necessary” within the terms of the subsection, it is appropriate to bear in mind that the LD Act itself contains elaborate provisions for investigating police to approach a Judge of the Supreme Court for the issue of a warrant. On the facts as found by his Honour, there was no impediment to JD approaching police with a complaint that the Appellant had sexually assaulted him and his brothers. A consequence of such a complaint may have been an application by police for a warrant under s.16 LD Act. If that had occurred, any conversation recorded pursuant to the warrant would have been lawfully obtained. 139 Having regard to this statutory context, and allowing for a construction that attributes to the words “reasonably necessary” the meaning “reasonably appropriate”, it is difficult to see how the factual findings in this case are capable of satisfying the statutory requirement for reasonable necessity. The test, of course, is an objective one. Reasonable necessity is to be judged objectively upon bases or grounds that exist at the time of the recording. The ability of JD to approach police with his complaints, rather than move directly to himself record the conversation, stands in the way of a finding of reasonable necessity in this case. I am satisfied that error has been demonstrated in the learned trial Judge’s finding that JD’s recording of his conversation in May 1999 with the Appellant was “reasonably necessary” for the purposes of s.5(3)(b)(i) LD Act. 140 Having regard to this finding, it is not strictly necessary to consider the balance of the trial Judge’s findings that the recording was necessary for the protection of JD’s “lawful interests”. This is especially so given that, at the hearing of the appeal, the parties referred to limited authority on this topic. 141 A number of observations should nevertheless be made. Although the term “lawful interests” is capable of a broad construction, the statutory context in which the words appear suggests that the meaning is not open ended. The provision constitutes a statutory exemption to the prohibition upon recording in s.5(1) LD Act. The LD Act operates to protect privacy. 142 Section 5(3)(b)(i) LD Act should not be interpreted in such a way as to render otiose the primary purpose of the Act, which is to protect privacy by prohibiting covert recording of a conversation other than (usually) by way of a warrant under the Act. Section 5(3)(b(i) operates as an exception. The construction of the learned trial Judge would leave open the covert recording of a conversation by any person who alleges that he or she is a victim of crime, and who speaks to the alleged offender for the purpose of obtaining admissions of offences. The “lawful interests” identified by the learned trial Judge in the present case are of a somewhat nebulous kind. They do not appear to satisfy the requirement that the recording be undertaken for the protection of then existing lawful interests. It is important that a construction not be attached to this statutory exception which would serve to undermine, in a significant respect, a primary purpose of the LD Act.143 It is doubtful that the findings of the trial Judge in the present case provided a basis for a finding that the recording was permissible to protect JD’s lawful interest. To the extent that the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Le touched on this point, the observations made constituted obiter dicta in the form of differing opinions, and shades of opinion, as between the three Judges who constituted the Court. Given my conclusions with respect to the issue of reasonable necessity, and given the limited nature of the submissions made on the hearing of the present appeal, however, it is not appropriate to express a concluded view with respect to the suggested “lawful interests” in this case.144 In summary: 
     
      
      (a) the trial Judge’s findings of fact concerning JD’s purpose and motive in making the recording were open on the evidence, and no error has been demonstrated in that respect; 
       
       
      (b) error of law has been demonstrated on the part of the trial Judge in that, upon the findings of fact and conclusions reached by his Honour, it was not open to find that the recording of the conversation was  
      “reasonably necessary” 
       so as to fall within the statutory exemption contained in s.5(3)(b)(i) LD Act;  
       
       
      (c) a consequence of these conclusions is that error has been demonstrated in the trial Judge’s conclusion that the tape recording had not been made in breach of s.5 LD Act. 
      
     
     
      
      Admissibility of Evidence of Conversations Recorded in Breach of s.5 - Consideration of s.7(2)(b) and s.13 LD Act 
      
    145 Given the conclusion with respect to s.5(3)(b)(i) LD Act, it is necessary to consider the application of s.7(2)(b) LD Act and s.138 Evidence Act 1995. 146 Section 13 LD Act prohibits the giving of evidence by a person in any civil or criminal proceedings of a private conversation where the conversation has come to the knowledge of that person as a direct or indirect result of the use of a listening device contrary to s.5. Section 13 LD Act does not apply, however, where the “person called to give the evidence” is a “principal party” to the private conversation: Amalgamated Television Services Pty Limited v Marsden at paragraph 30; Eade at 453-454 [22]-[25]; 459-460 [56]. 147 Where the party to a private conversation is the witness to give evidence of the recorded conversation, s.7 LD Act is the applicable provision. Section 7(2)(b) provides that s.7(1) does not apply where the communication or publication is made in the course of legal proceedings. Evidence may be given by that party by using the recording to revive memory. If the recording was made in breach of s.5 LD Act, however, the issue of illegality or impropriety will arise for consideration under s.138 Evidence Act 1995: Eade at 453-454 [24], 460 [58].148 To reconcile s.7(2)(b) LD Act and s.138 Evidence Act 1995, it is appropriate to construe s.7(2)(b) as meaning that a communication or publication of a conversation recorded in breach of s.5 may be made in the course of legal proceedings if the evidence is admissible under the laws of evidence, including s.138 Evidence Act 1995. 149 It is necessary to consider whether the recording was admissible under s.138 Evidence Act 1995. The findings of fact of the trial Judge concerning JD’s purpose and motive in making the recording are relevant. At both trials, the contents of the recording were held to be highly probative and it was held that there was no unfair prejudice to the Appellant in the tender of the recording. The trials of the Appellant involved serious criminal charges. This was not a case where a covert recording was made by a third party of a conversation between two other parties. JD was a principal party to the recorded conversation. JD (a layman) undertook the recording of his own initiative and was not acting as an agent of the police. It was his evidence that he intended to take the recording to the police and, in due course, he did so. The evidence obtained was of high probative value and of great importance in the proceedings. If the trial Judge had come to exercise the s.138 discretion and to have regard to the factors in s.138(3) of the Act, then, given his Honour’s findings of fact, the Crown would have demonstrated that the recording ought be admitted under s.138. In my view, such a conclusion would have been reached even after full weight was given to the statutory purpose underlying s.5 LD Act. The trial Judge would have been satisfied that the desirability of admitting the evidence of the recording outweighed the undesirability of admitting evidence obtained in the way in which this evidence was obtained.  
     
      
    150 Of course, the outcome with respect to the first ground of appeal in this case ought not be treated as the necessary outcome in other cases, in the event that a recording made in contravention of s.5 LD Act is tendered and a discretionary decision must be made under s.138 Evidence Act 1995. Whether a recording made in breach of the LD Act would be admitted into evidence in other proceedings will depend upon the particular facts and circumstances of the case, and matters relevant to the exercise of discretion to admit evidence under s.138.151 In circumstances where I am satisfied that the evidence would have been admitted at both trials, the Appellant has failed to make good the first ground challenging the admissibility of the recording at both trials.152 The first ground of appeal is rejected with respect to both the first and second trials. 
     
      
      The Second Ground - the Failure to Give a  
      “Dangerous to Convict”  
       Direction 
       
      
    153 It is appropriate to set out the directions given by the trial Judge at both trials in accordance with the principles in Longman.  
     
      
       
      Directions to Jury at First Trial 
       
      
    154 His Honour Judge Woods QC provided the jury with detailed written directions on issues of law at the first trial (MFI25). Included in those under a heading “Lack of Evidence of Complaint - Delay of Allegations” were the following directions (MFI25, pages 5-6): 
     
      
       
        
        “It is most important that you appreciate fully the adverse effects of absence of complaint on the ability of the accused to test prosecution evidence or to adduce evidence in his own case, and possibly (although he has no legal burden of proof) to establish a reasonable doubt about his guilt. 
         
         
        In this regard, I warn you of the following specific difficulties encountered by the accused in testing the evidence of the prosecution or in adducing evidence in defence: 
         
         
        a. the delay in instituting the prosecution - approximately two decades - means that the accused would very likely have difficulties in securing evidence such as school records, driver's licence records and other evidence as to relevant dates, possibly allowing an alibi to the accused; 
         
         
        b. delay would provide a particular difficulty for the accused, after several decades, to obtain evidence about the buildings where offences are alleged to have occurred, such as presence of security cameras or officers, and security videos, if they existed; 
         
         
        c. the delay will have created difficulties for the accused in locating any officers who may have worked at the buildings; 
         
         
        d. delay will have caused the destruction or loss of relevant documents such as contract documents, or documents relating to access to buildings; 
         
         
        e. the possibility of distortion in human recollection. In particular, it would be difficult after several decades for the witnesses and the accused to remember dates, times, places and events; 
         
         
        f. the nature of the allegations. Most sexual contact is private, in the absence of witnesses. This makes the securing of other evidence vital, and the accused must have had difficulties in this regard; 
         
         
        g. the age of the complainant witnesses at the time of the allegations may increase the possibility of unreliability or inaccuracy in their evidence; 
        
       
       
        
        By reason of these difficulties and other similar difficulties which might occur to you, great caution is required in the way you approach the prosecution evidence. You have a duty to consider carefully the matters to which I have referred you and the warnings which I have given you. Having done so, it is then a matter for you to determine what weight you should give to the complainant witnesses' evidence in this case, and you should only accept it if you are satisfied of its truth and accuracy.” 
        
       
      
    155 The written directions to the jury included the following directions concerning the need to scrutinise the evidence of Crown witnesses with care (MFI25, page 12): 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        Scrutinise Evidence With Care 
        
       
       
        
        The evidence of the complainants, BD and JD, relates (on their versions), to events over two decades ago. As I have already said, I direct you that the long lapse of time makes it necessary that you should scrutinise the evidence of each of the complainants with great caution before you would accept it and act upon it. The long lapse of time involved may have distorted recollections or otherwise created unreliability in testimony. But this is not to tell you that you must or should reject the evidence of JD and/or BD. You may conclude that all of it (or the important parts of it) are consistent with other independent evidence, and that it is honest and reliable. You are the judges of the facts.” 
        
       
      
    156 The learned trial Judge distributed copies of MFI25 to the jury at the commencement of his summing up on 24 June 2004. His Honour gave the jury detailed oral directions concerning lack of evidence of complaint and delay in the making of the allegations (SU, pages 11-15): 
     
      
       
        
        “I turn to the subject of lack of evidence of complaint and delay of allegations. I have already mentioned in relation to count 1, which applies to all the counts, the problems that arise for the accused in dealing with the wide expanse of time charged in each count. The accused has argued that the absence of any complaint made by  
        [BD]  
        and  
        [JD] 
         to anyone to whom they might reasonably be expected to complain is inconsistent with the conduct of a truthful person who has been sexually assaulted. The accused says that you should therefore regard their evidence that they were sexually assaulted as false, particularly bearing in mind that the delay before the matter has been brought to the notice of the authorities is about two decades and more in some instances.  
         
         
        This is a matter which you should consider but I must warn you that the mere absence of a complaint does not necessarily indicate that the evidence of a complainant is false. It may indicate fabrication on the part of  
        [BD]  
        or  
        [JD] 
        but it does not necessarily do so. There may be good reasons why a person who has been sexually assaulted does not complain to anyone. For example, a male person who has consented to homosexual contact as a child or young person may be ashamed or embarrassed to have it brought to public notice.  
         
         
        On the other hand, however, it is important that I give you certain warnings which reflect the long experience of the Courts in cases such as this.  
        
       
       
        
        [His Honour here gave directions in terms of paragraphs (a) to (g) of the written directions set out in paragraph 154 above]. 
         
         
        Now I digress on that point. On the Crown case, at the time that  
        [JD] 
        and  
        [BD] 
         are talking about they were, on their version of events, very young, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen. And you may be concerned that there could be difficulties for them as young people in remembering events at that time.  
         
         
        On the other hand, of course, the way this case has been conducted by the accused, the defence proposition is that none of the sexual contact occurred when the complainants were children. Accordingly, if they were, if you think it a reasonable possibility that they were eighteen, nineteen, twenty when sexual contact was occurring, that consideration would not be so relevant.  
        
       
       
        
        In any event, if you think it is a reasonable possibility that the sexual contact was confined to the post eighteen time, then, of course, the accused must be acquitted in any event. I have mentioned those difficulties and it may be that there are other difficulties that occur to you and you should bear those matters of caution in mind in approaching the prosecution evidence.  
        
       
       
        
        You have a duty to consider carefully the cautionary matters to which I have referred and the warnings which I have given you. Having done that, it is then a matter for you to determine what weight you should give to the complainant witness’s evidence in this case and you should only accept it if you are satisfied of its truth and accuracy deliberated upon in the light of those cautions and concerns which I have mentioned.” 
        
       
      
    157 Counsel for the Appellant made application at the first trial for a “dangerous to convict” direction on Longman grounds with respect to JD and BD, but the learned trial Judge declined to give such a direction. 
     
      
       
      Directions to Jury at Second Trial 
       
      
    158 At the second trial, his Honour Judge Woods QC again provided the jury with written directions of law (MFI3) at the commencement of his summing up on 7 December 2004.  
     
      
    159 The written directions to the jury contained the following Longman directions (MFI3, pages 4-5): 
     
      
       
        
        “It is most important that you appreciate fully the adverse effects of absence of complaint on the ability of the accused to challenge prosecution evidence or to present evidence in his own case, and possibly (although he has no legal burden of proof) to establish a reasonable doubt about his guilt. 
         
         
        In this regard, I warn you of the following specific difficulties encountered by the accused in challenging the evidence of the prosecution or in presenting evidence in his defence: 
         
         
        a. neither offence is alleged to have occurred on a specific date – for example, the 3rd of March. As a result, this vagueness hampers the accused in obtaining possible evidence of an alibi; 
         
         
        b. the delay in instituting the prosecution - over two decades - means that the accused would very likely have difficulties in securing evidence such as school records, driver's licence records and other evidence as to relevant dates, possibly allowing an alibi to the accused; 
         
         
        c. delay would provide a particular difficulty for the accused, after several decades, to obtain evidence about the buildings where offences are alleged to have occurred, such as (for example) whether there was a door on a toilet block or the possible presence of security cameras or other witnesses; 
         
         
        d. the possibility of distortion in human recollection. The longer the period between an `event' and its recall, the greater the margin for error. Interference with a person's ability to `remember' may also arise from talking or reading about or experiencing other events of a similar nature or from the person's own thinking or recalling. The experience of the courts has shown that human recollection is frequently erroneous and liable to distortion by reason of various factors and further, that the likelihood of error increases with delay; 
         
         
        e. the nature of the allegations. Most sexual contact is private, in the absence of witnesses. This makes the securing of other evidence vital, and the accused must have had difficulties in this regard; 
         
         
        f. the age of the prosecution witnesses at the time of the allegations may increase the possibility of unreliability or inaccuracy in their evidence; 
        
       
       
        
        I warn you that these are real difficulties which would be likely to affect the capacity of the accused to test the allegations. By reason of these difficulties and other similar difficulties which might occur to you, great caution is required in the way you approach the prosecution evidence. 
         
         
        You have a duty to consider carefully the matters to which I have referred you and the warnings which I have given you. Having done so, it is then a matter for you to determine what weight you should give to the prosecution’s evidence in this case, and you should only accept it if you are satisfied of its truth and accuracy.” 
        
       
      
    160 The written directions to the jury at the second trial included the following directions (MFI3, page 6): 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        Scrutinise Evidence With Care 
         
         
        The evidence of the complainant,  
        [ID] 
        , and of his brothers, relates (on their versions), to events over two decades ago. As I have already said, I direct you that the long lapse of time makes it necessary that you should scrutinise the evidence of these witnesses with great caution before you would accept it and act upon it. The long lapse of time involved may have distorted recollections or otherwise created unreliability in testimony. But this is not to tell you that you must or should reject the evidence of these witnesses. You may conclude that all of it (or the important parts of it) are consistent with other independent evidence, and that it is honest and reliable. You are the judges of the facts.” 
        
       
      
    161 His Honour gave the jury the following oral directions concerning delay (SU, pages 9-11): 
     
      
       
        
        “Let me turn to the question of the delay in the bringing forward of these allegations. The accused has argued, through his counsel, that the absence of any complaint made by  
        [ID] 
         to anyone to whom he might reasonably been expected to complain, is inconsistent with the conduct of a truthful person who has been sexually assaulted. The accused says that you should therefore regard the evidence that he was sexually assaulted as false, particularly bearing in mind that the delay before the matter has been brought to the authorities is over two decades. That is a point which you must consider, but I must warn you that the mere absence of a complaint does not necessarily indicate that the evidence of a complainant is false. It may indicate fabrication on the part of  
        [ID] 
        , but it does not necessarily do so. There may be good reasons why a person who has been sexually assaulted does not complain to anyone, for example, a male person who has consented to homosexual contact as a child or young person, may when young be ashamed, or embarrassed to have it brought to public notice.  
        
       
       
        
        On the other hand however, it is important that I give you certain warnings which reflect the long experience of the courts in cases of such as this.  
        
       
       
        
        [His Honour here gave directions in terms of paragraphs (a) to (f) of the written directions set out at paragraph 159 above]. 
         
         
        I warn you these are real difficulties which would be likely to effect the capacity of the accused in this trial to test the allegations. 
         
         
        By reason of these difficulties and other similar difficulties which might occur to you, great caution is required in the way you approach the Prosecution evidence. You have a duty to consider carefully the matters to which I have referred and the warnings which I have given you. Having done so, it is then a matter for you to determine what weight you should give to the Prosecution's evidence in this case, and you should only accept it if you are satisfied of its truth and accuracy.” 
        
       
      
    162 Shortly after giving this direction to the jury, counsel for the Appellant made the following application in the absence of the jury (SU12): 
     
      
       
        
        “VASIC: Has your Honour declined to warn the jury that it would be dangerous to convict in these circumstances? 
         
         
        HIS HONOUR: Yes. The form of words which I utilised is consistent with the authorities and in the circumstances of this case, particularly given the other extensive directions I have given, are adequate to convey the real necessity for the jury to be cautious.” 
        
       
       
      Submissions on Appeal Concerning the Second Ground 
       
      
    163 Mr Molomby SC submits that the directions given to the juries in both trials were defective given the refusal of the trial Judge to give a “dangerous to convict” direction arising from Longman. In each trial, counsel for the Appellant sought such a direction, but his Honour declined to give it. 
     
      
    164 His Honour did give the jury at the first trial a “dangerous to convict” direction concerning the evidence of JD, but not on a Longman basis. This discrete direction was given to the jury in a separate part of the summing up, well removed from the Longman directions. Included in the written directions given by the trial Judge at the first trial were the following directions concerning JD (MFI25, page 13): 
     
      
       
        
        “There are sound reasons why you should be particularly cautious about the evidence of  
        [JD] 
        .  
        
       
       
        
        There are various offences of dishonesty on his record. One theft is recorded against him in circumstances which he explains as being a theft by him of money offered to him by a ‘gay guy’ for sex. 
        
       
       
        
        He has been convicted of offences of violence and he has spent time in institutions for juvenile offenders.  
        
       
       
        
        I direct that it would be dangerous to convict the accused on the evidence of  
        [JD] 
         alone 
        . 
        
       
       
        
        However, this is not to say that you must or should reject the evidence of  
        [JD]. 
         You are entitled to accept it, if you have scrutinised it carefully. 
        
       
       
        
        You may be assisted in this scrutiny by looking for other evidence, independent of  
        [JD], 
         which may be consistent with his evidence.  
        
       
       
        
        If you conclude that there is such other evidence, that it is reliable, and that it confirms or is consistent with what  
        [JD]  
        says, that may assist you in the task in evaluating his evidence. 
        
       
       
        
        I repeat, however, that: 
        
       
       
        
        (i) it would be dangerous to convict the accused on any charge based on the evidence of  
        [JD] 
         alone; and 
         
         
        (ii) this does not mean that you must or should reject his evidence. 
        
       
       
        
        I remind you again that you are entitled to accept (or reject) the whole (or part) the evidence of any witness.” 
        
       
      
    165 It is apparent on the face of the direction that the learned trial Judge gave this direction concerning JD by way of s.165 Evidence Act 1995 having regard to particular aspects of JD’s background. The “dangerous to convict” component of this direction was not given on a Longman basis, arising from the delay between the alleged offences and the time when the Appellant became aware of the allegations. 
     
      
    166 Mr Molomby SC submitted that, as a matter of law, it was necessary for the trial Judge to give the juries at both trials a “dangerous to convict” direction, given the passage of time between the alleged offences and the trial. He referred to the judgments of Sully J and Hulme J in R v WSP [2005] NSWCCA 427 at paragraphs 93 and 181.  
     
      
    167 He submits that a striking feature of the present case is that the trial Judge himself, at the first trial, acknowledged a significant difference between a warning including the concept of “dangerous to convict” and one that does not, because he gave such a warning in relation to the evidence of JD, but declined to do so in relation to BD. Mr Molomby SC submits that a jury paying conscientious attention to the directions could not have missed noticing the difference. In short, Mr Molomby SC submitted that an element which the High Court in Longman saw as necessary was specifically omitted from the warning given in relation to the complainant BD. 
     
      
    168 With respect to the second trial, Mr Molomby SC submitted that a very similar direction was given (SU9-11). Once again, a “dangerous to convict” direction was not given, although it had been specifically sought by defence counsel (MFI2; SU12).169 The Crown emphasised that no complaint was made by the Appellant on appeal that the jury at each trial had not been properly directed regarding other aspects of the Longman warning, apart from the “dangerous to convict” formula. The Crown submitted that the trial Judge had given the juries at both trials extensive Longman directions in the written and oral directions set out in paragraphs 154-156 and 159-161 of this judgment.170 The Crown referred to R v Johnston (1998) 45 NSWLR 362, where the Chief Justice, at 371, stated that a Longman warning needed to emphasise that the effect of delay meant that a complainant’s evidence could not be adequately tested and that because of this, it was necessary to scrutinise the evidence with great care. The Crown submitted that such directions had been given at both of the Appellant’s trials.171 The Crown submitted that the trial Judge used the forceful expression, with respect to the evidence of JD and BD, “You should only accept it if you are satisfied of its truth and accuracy” (SU15). 
     
      
    172 According to the Crown, a “dangerous to convict” direction is not an indispensable part of a Longman direction. Reliance was placed upon the statements of the Chief Justice in R v WSP at paragraph 13 and R v JJB [2006] NSWCCA 126, the decision in R v DBG (2002) 133 A Crim R 227 at 233-235 and a line of authority in Western Australia exemplified by RAK v Western Australia [2006] WASCA 6 at paragraph 9. 
     
      
    173 With respect to the second trial, the Crown emphasised again that the only area of complaint was the failure to give a “dangerous to convict” direction. No other complaint was made by the Appellant with respect to the substance and detail of the directions given in accordance with Longman. 
     
      
    174 The Crown pointed to the fact that, in any event, the evidence of ID did not stand alone in the second trial. In relation to the Maroubra incident, support for ID was to be found in the following circumstances: 
     
      
       
      (a) uncontested evidence that the Appellant, aged in his early 30s, took ID and other young boys to the Maroubra beach as alleged; 
       
       
      (b) evidence from BD that RM spoke to ID, and at one stage, the two of them, and the Appellant, were heading for the toilet; 
       
       
      (c) the modus operandi employed by the Appellant in paragraph (b) above was the same of that employed when he sought to get ID into the toilet, to pretend they would have sexual contact together, so as to lure DB into the same situation. 
       
      
    175 In relation to the Stanmore incident, the Crown submitted that support for ID was to be found in the following circumstances: 
     
      
       
      (a) evidence from JD that he and ID went together to the Appellant’s unit around the time alleged and the Appellant had said to them  
      “my brother mustn’t find out” 
      ; 
       
       
      (b) evidence from JD that on this occasion the Appellant made use of a Polaroid camera and gave money to them both. 
       
      
    176 In these circumstances, the Crown submitted, in any event, that no unfairness could flow from a failure to tell the jury that it would be dangerous to convict on the evidence of ID alone, when ID’s evidence was not alone.  
     
      
       
      Resolution of Competing Submissions on the  
      “Dangerous to Convict”  
      Ground 
       
      
    177 There is no doubt that there was a substantial delay, in the order of 20 to 25 years, between the time of the alleged offences and the time of the Appellant’s arrest in 2000 and his trials in 2004. There was no controversy that, at both trials, a Longman direction was required. The issue in the present appeal concerns the extent of the Longman directions actually given. Extensive directions were given, in each trial, to this end. The sole complaint relates to the refusal of the trial Judge to use the “dangerous to convict” formula in his directions to the jury. 
     
      
    178 The High Court in Longman required that a warning, in substance, be given in an appropriate case but did not devise a mandatory formula for that direction: New Zealand v Moloney [2006] FCAFC 143 at paragraph 215. Longman does not require that a “dangerous to convict” direction be given in every case of substantial delay between the alleged offence and the accused learning of the allegations against him: R v DBG at 233-234 [28]. As Simpson J observed in DRE v R [2006] NSWCCA 280 at paragraphs 59-60: 
     
      
       
        
        “Although many may have made the attempt, no definitive statement of the minimum requirements of a  
        Longman 
         direction has yet emerged. In particular, there is no unanimity, and no definitive decision, on whether the principle mandates the use of the formula ‘dangerous to convict’ and whether ‘unsafe to convict’ is its equivalent. 
         
         
        In my opinion this appeal ought to be approached on the basis that a  
        Longman 
         or  
        Crampton 
         direction should be tailored to the factual circumstances of the case in which the question arises. Whether any direction concerning the effects of delay on the capacity of the accused to defend himself or herself is adequate will depend upon the infinite variety of circumstances that go to make up the facts of a criminal trial.” 
        
       
      
    179 In Wade v R [2006] NSWCCA 295, Barr J (Hunt AJA and myself agreeing) said at paragraphs 23-25 with respect to a Longman direction: 
     
      
       
        
        “23 Secondly, it may be said that no particular form of words is needed when directing the jury:  
        R v Kesisyan 
         [2003] NSWCCA 259.  
         
         
        24 Thirdly, it is not necessary, in fact undesirable, to use the words ‘dangerous to convict’ or ‘unsafe to convict’ when giving a  
        Longman 
         warning. These expressions bear similar meanings:  
        Doggett v The Queen 
         (2001) 208 CLR 343 per Gleeson CJ at [10]; see also the judgment of Spigelman CJ in  
        R v Robinson 
         [2006] NSWCCA 192 and of Sully J in  
        R v BWT 
        .  
         
         
        25 What is necessary is that the trial judge should add the weight of judicial opinion that the relevant disadvantages do exist and why they exist.” 
        
       
      
    180 As a matter of law, it is not essential that the “dangerous to convict” formula be used as part of a Longman direction. Whether a “dangerous to convict” direction ought be given depends upon the circumstances of the particular case.  
     
      
    181 It has been observed that the use of the “dangerous to convict” formula may intrude into the fact-finding process that is the province of the jury and may be understood by a jury as, in effect, a direction by the Judge to acquit the accused: Robinson v R (2006) 162 A Crim R 88 at 94-95; DRE v R at paragraph 27. In a recent paper, the Hon James Wood AO QC observed that one of the problems with the Longman direction is that the use of the expression “dangerous (or unsafe) to convict” carries an inherent invitation to acquit (“Jury Directions”, AIJA Appeal Judges Conference, Adelaide, September 2006, page 4).  
     
      
    182 In Wade v R, Hunt AJA (myself agreeing), at paragraphs 2-3, explained the requirement that a Longman warning should have the weight and authority of the Court: 
     
      
       
        
        “2 One particular complaint made by the appellant is that the trial judge failed in his directions concerning delay to use language which conveyed ‘the weight and authority of the court’. It is a complaint which appears to misunderstand what is meant by that phrase, a misunderstanding which has occurred in some other appeals. What it means is no more than that the various warnings which either the legislature or the appellate courts have required trial judges to give in relation to various issues to be determined by the jury must be seen by the jury to be given on the judge’s own behalf, and not merely by way of reference to what counsel may have submitted to the jury. It does not require any particular form of words to demonstrate that the direction is being given by the judge on his or her authority. 
         
         
        3 It is clear that the judge added the weight of his judicial authority to the directions in issue in this appeal, and that the jury would so have understood them.” 
        
       
      
    183 I have read and reread the directions as a whole given to the jury, both orally and in writing, at both trials with respect to the effect of delay. The Judge placed emphasis upon the practical effect of delay. I am satisfied that the trial Judge, at both trials, adequately brought home to the jury, in the manner required by Longman, the disadvantages suffered by the Appellant by reason of the delay in the bringing of the allegations. 
     
      
    184 In particular, at both trials, the learned trial Judge: 
     
      
       
      (a) explained to the jury that it was most important to appreciate fully the adverse effects of absence of complaint on the ability of the Appellant to test prosecution evidence or to adduce evidence in his own case; 
       
       
      (b) warned the jury of a series of specific difficulties encountered by the Appellant in testing the evidence of the prosecution or in adducing evidence in the defence case; 
       
       
      (c) directed the jury that, by reason of these difficulties and other similar difficulties which might occur to the jury, great caution was required in the way in which the jury approached the prosecution evidence; 
       
       
      (d) directed the jury that it had a duty to consider carefully the matters to which reference had been made and the warnings given; 
       
       
      (e) directed the jury that, having done so, it was a matter for the jury to determine what weight should be given to the evidence of the complainants and  
      “you should only accept it if you are satisfied of its truth and accuracy” 
      ; 
       
       
      (f) directed the jury that it should  
      “scrutinise the evidence of each of the complainants with great caution before you would accept it and act upon it” 
      ; 
       
       
      (g) directed the jury that it was important to give these warnings which  
      “reflect the long experience of the courts in cases such as this” 
      . 
       
      
    185 The learned trial Judge provided substantial and detailed directions at both trials in which the substance of a Longman warning was conveyed to the jury with the authority of the Court. In the circumstances of the present case, I am satisfied that a “dangerous to convict” direction was not required in either the first or second trial.  
     
      
    186 The fact that a “dangerous to convict” direction was given with respect to JD at the first trial (for an entirely different purpose) does not, in my opinion, affect the position. The reason for this direction would have been obvious to the jury. As the trial Judge made clear in both the written and oral directions, there were features affecting JD, including his criminal history, which called for additional circumspection with respect to his evidence. These features did not apply with respect to BD. This is not a case where a “dangerous to convict” direction was given on a Longman basis, with respect to JD but not BD.  
     
      
    187 I am not satisfied that error has been demonstrated with respect to the directions given at the first trial. A “dangerous to convict” direction was not required as a matter of law. In the circumstances of the case, it was not necessary for the trial Judge to give a “dangerous to convict” direction with respect to the evidence of BD. Substantial and elaborate Longman directions were given to the jury with respect to the evidence of JD and BD. 
     
      
    188 Likewise, I am not satisfied that error has been demonstrated with respect to the directions at the second trial. A “dangerous to convict” direction was not required as a matter of law. In the circumstances of the case, it was not necessary for the trial Judge to give a “dangerous to convict” direction with respect to the evidence of ID. His Honour gave substantial and elaborate directions concerning the effect of delay upon the jury’s fact-finding process in accordance with Longman. 
     
      
    189 The second ground of appeal against conviction ought be rejected with respect to both the first and second trials. 
     
      
       
      Conclusion 
       
      
    190 No ground of appeal has been made out with respect to the Appellant’s conviction at the first or second trials. No challenge is now made to the sentences imposed upon the Appellant. 
     
      
    191 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      (a) time to file a Notice of Appeal with respect to the second trial is extended to 16 May 2006; 
       
       
      (b) the appeals against conviction at the first and second trials are dismissed.
