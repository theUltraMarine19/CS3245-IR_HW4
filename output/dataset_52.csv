GROUNDS OF DECISION
On 16 March 1992, the 2nd accused pleaded guilty before me to the following charge:
That you, Raja s/o Ramo, on or about the 8th day of August 1989 between 1.00 p.m. and 3.00 p.m. at Changi Point, Singapore, in furtherance of the common intention of all three of you, did voluntarily cause hurt to one Natha Kumar s/o Sahajanandam by means of an instrument, to wit, a police baton, which used as a weapon of offence is likely to cause death, when one of you used the police baton to strike the said Natha Kumar s/o Sahajanandam several times on his person and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 324 read with section 34 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.
The victim of injuries leading to the charge arising from events on 8 August 1989 was one Natha Kumar s/o Sahajanandam, a 15-year-old student at Deyi Secondary School. Three persons were charged with offences arising from the injuries sustained by him. All three were charged under s324 of the Penal Code with voluntarily causing hurt by means of an instrument which used as a weapon of offence is likely to cause death. One of the others was charged with voluntarily causing grievous hurt under s326 of the Penal Code. The third faced an additional charge of culpable homicide not amounting to murder under s304(a) of the Penal Code.
Each pleaded guilty to the respective charges and was sentenced. The second accused, Raja s/o Ramo, now appeals against the sentence imposed on him.
Raja s/o Ramo, born on 13 December 1970, was 18 years and 7 months at the time of the offence. Together with the other two, the first accused, Ferosh Khan, aged 18 years and the third, Arjunan, aged 20 years, he worked as a security officer-cum-dog handler for a security
company. The three of them had a grievance against the victim, then aged 15, who was spotted by one of the three accused on the morning of the day in question. Each, for his own reason, wanted to confront the victim.
After the victim's denial of being involved in any of the incidents that the accused persons thought gave rise to their grievances, they asked him to meet them at the coffee shop. There, he was further confronted and pressed for the address of another person who the three accused believed was the main trouble maker in the incidents giving rise to their grievances. The victim agreed to do so, whereupon the three accused formed their intention to beat him up. At that time, Arjunan had a police baton carried hidden in a bag.
A lorry was borrowed from their employer by Arjunan who drove it to where the appellant and Ferosh were waiting with the victim. Before boarding the lorry, the appellant went looking for a weapon and, from his block of flats, brought a long rattan pole with him. They drove off in the lorry with the victim but he was not co-operative in revealing the address he said he would. The accused persons then drove around and the questioning of the victim continued.
During this time, the appellant kicked the victim and to all intents and purposes was the initiator of an act of violence on the victim. The lorry was then parked somewhere near Changi Point and all three accused persons assaulted the victim. The appellant also used the rattan pole to beat the victim, causing the injuries to his head. Throughout this incident, the victim did not retaliate. He hardly could have. He was left lying on the floor of the lorry, injured and bleeding from the head.
Arjunan then decided to return the lorry to its owner. Looking in the cabin for a cloth for the victim to wipe his bloodstains, the first accused (Ferosh) found one in which a parang was wrapped. He took both to the rear of the lorry and gave the cloth to the victim, leaving the parang on the floor of the lorry.
Arjunan was driving the lorry and the appellant and Ferosh were in the rear with the victim. When the lorry was being driven over a bumpy track, the victim got up suddenly. Ferosh, fearing the victim was going for the parang, grabbed it and slashed the victim on the back and side.
The appellant grabbed the parang from Ferosh and he claimed that whilst he was doing so, it accidentally hit the victim. The pathologist found three parang injuries on the victim. The cuts caused were respectively, (i) 11.5 x 5 cm, (ii) 10 x 3.5 cm and (iii) 6.7 x 3 cm. The last was superficial but it is difficult to believe that any one of the three was caused accidentally.
The lorry was stopped and in response to the victim scolding him when Arjunan apologised, Arjunan grabbed the parang and slashed the victim on his neck causing a gaping wound.
The victim was abandoned beside a dirt track to be discovered by chance only three days later.
In mitigation it was said that the appellant's father passed away when he was five. He has an elder brother and a younger sister. His mother works as a factory operative.
His sickly disposition was claimed to have impaired academic performance at school. He attended the Vocational & Industrial Training Board in 1986. He then worked as a welder and while awaiting National Service worked for a security company when the offence took place.
It was emphasised by his advocate that the appellant grabbed the parang from Ferosh to prevent further injury to the victim but while doing so, may have hit the victim again.
This I found difficult to believe. Even if I were to believe it, I must take into account the likelihood of injury when on a moving lorry a parang is snatched away by one from another.
While the appellant and Ferosh were earlier waiting with the victim for Arjunan to bring the lorry, upon its arrival the appellant went to his block of flats to look for a weapon. He found a long rattan pole he brought with him.
Having regard to the common intention which led to more serious charge against his fellow accused, the appellant must consider himself lucky that the charge against him was under s324.
In view of this, I thought the appropriate sentence was the maximum term of imprisonment under that section. The appellant saw fit to leave the others and go to his block of flats to get a rattan pole. As stated in the charge, he struck the victim with the police baton. He inflicted the first blows on the victim. In view of the appellant's use of the police baton to inflict injuries, I was also of the view that ten strokes of the cane was appropriate.",1992-09-07 00:00:00,SG High Court
