2703123,R v Razzak [2015] NSWDC 366,"SENTENCE


	
	HIS HONOUR: Up until the age of about 17 Hazsam Abdel Razzak was on a path of which every parent would be proud. He had completed high school, he was going to TAFE he was working, and he had the intention of taking up a trade in plumbing. However things began to fall apart when he tried marijuana, initially as a means of relieving stress, at about the age of 17. As is often the case, starting out by using one drug led soon to the use of another drug, in this case Ice, at about 21. Gradually as his drug use increased his ability to study and work decreased until he gave up TAFE and he gave up work.
	
	
	It was in these circumstances that he began supplying drugs. He faces sentence today for two offences for supplying methylamphetamine relating to two different quantities found at different addresses. I am also to sentence him for an offence of dealing with property being suspected to be proceeds of crime relating to some of the money found.
	
	
	The matters came to the attention of police when they executed a search warrant at some premises in Beverley Hills. The offender did not live there but visited there quite a bit. Police forced entry. As they did so another person who was in the house, Michael Shelton, threw something out a window. This later proved to contain some drugs.
	
	
	When police went into the lounge room they saw the offender effectively sitting in the middle of a number of small clear, resealable bags containing a white substance. The offender admitted today that it was he who had put the drugs, because that is what the white substance turned out to be, in those bags.
	
	
	Other paraphernalia of a drug dealer were found, five separate mobile phones and digital scales amongst them. Police then went to the backyard where Mr Shelton had thrown an object there, they found a small safe-like device using a key which the offender had had in his possession, the safe was opened and more small resealable bags containing drugs were found.
	
	
	There were a number of bags of cannabis as well as the bags with the methylamphetamine. The total amount of methylamphetamine located in both the backyard and the lounge room is 9.83 grams with a purity of about 75%. There was 38.1 grams of cannabis located there as well.
	
	
	One of the mobile phones contained on it text messages relating to drug supplies on 12 August, 14 August and 16 August. Clearly the offender had those drugs in his possession for the purposes of supplying them, the only qualification to that being that he may well have used some of them himself.
	
	
	Police then went to where Mr Razzak usually lived. His mother was at home together with two of the offender’s brothers. Police went to the offender’s bedroom and located more drugs, both methylamphetamine and cannabis, numerous empty resealable bags, some cash and a drug ledger. A further sum of cash was found in another safe-like device within the bedroom. The total quantity of methylamphetamine seized from those premises was 15.06 grams, again with an approximate purity of 75% and the cannabis seized amounted to 11.4 grams.
	
	
	The offender participated in electronically recorded interview with police in which he denied committing any offences at all. He soon changed his mind because he pleaded guilty at the Local Court to the supply drug matters which I have already mentioned. In recognition of the utilitarian value of his pleas of guilty I will impose a sentence upon the offender which is 25% less than it would otherwise have been.
	
	
	When I sentence him for one of the offences of supplying prohibited drug, that relating to the 15.06 grams found in his bedroom, he asks that I take into account two Form 1 matters, they relating to possession of the cannabis found in each of the premises. I should also mention that the cash which is suspected of being the proceeds of crime totalled $3,450.
	
	
	The community is rightfully concerned about offences of this kind for precisely the reason that drugs cause harm of enormous proportions. Unfortunately the offender’s downward slide from productive, studious, member of society to a drug dealer is all too common. It is for this reason that the courts must respond by imposing significant sentences on those detected as being drug dealers in the hope that other people will not be subject to the same temptations that the offender was. General deterrence is of prime importance in cases of this kind.
	
	
	Specific deterrence is also important in the present case. The offender has a long-term drug addiction, during his time in custody he has apparently been clean, but upon release to society he will have no partner, no job and so the temptations which he will face will be significant. It is important therefore that the offender knows that harsh punishment is inflicted on drug traffickers so that when he does face the temptations he must face upon release he will be able to consider the likely outcome of drug use, involving as it does such a short step to drug supply which will in turn see him returned to custody for longer and longer periods each time he offends.
	
	
	If what the offender said in evidence is true then there has been a large change in attitude and outlook on his behalf. The offender says all the right things and his mother gave evidence that she has noticed a significant change in the offender’s outlook and behaviour since he went into custody. There are thus prospects for the offender’s rehabilitation. It is impossible to assess how good they are but I accept that the offender does desire to change his life. He accepts the terrible position he has put his mother in.
	
	
	It was not that long ago that his parents separated after an unhappy marriage which involved the offender’s father treating his mother very badly. He has no relationship with his father anymore and does not even know where he is. The offender feels guilty, as he should, for the trouble he has caused his mother and I expect that this will be one significant factor suggesting that Mr Razzak will try to be a better son, which in particular means he will try not to use and supply drugs in the future.
	
	
	The offender also expresses his remorse for his offending. He more than most knows the harm that drugs cause because he has been a victim of them himself. He recognises his role in causing harm to the drug users to whom he supplied drugs and he regrets his behaviour.
	
	
	This is the offender’s first time in custody. He has one drug supply matter and drug possession matters on his criminal history. The drug supply matter was dealt with in the Local Court and he received a suspended sentence of imprisonment. There is no suggestion that he breached the good behaviour bond that came with that sentence of imprisonment.
	
	
	So this is a significant escalation in the offender’s offending. It is conceded by Mr Breton who appears for the offender that nothing other than fulltime custody is appropriate. I agree, the offender was clearly trafficking to a substantial degree and there is no suggestion at all that there are exceptional circumstances which would justify anything other than a fulltime custodial sentence.
	
	
	As Mr Breton correctly recognises the only issue for me is how long that sentence should be. The answer to that question is the minimum period which properly reflects the principles of sentencing which I must apply particularly the need for general deterrence and specific deterrence in this case.
	
	
	There are special circumstances. Clearly it is in the offender’s favour, but more importantly the community’s interest that the offender be supervised upon his release from custody. He will need help in order to avoid reoffending and if that help achieves its object that the offender does not re-offend, then the community benefits. For that reason I will make a finding of special circumstances in the offender’s favour.
	
	
	I will partially accumulate the two sentences I must impose for the supply of drugs matters. I must sentence for each offence and recognise that there is additional criminality by having additional drugs in his possession for the purposes of that supply in the two premises.
	
	
	The sentence I impose is as follows:
	
	
	For the offence of dealing with property being the suspected proceeds of crime, I deal with the matter under s 10A of the Crime (Sentencing Procedure) Act, that is, he is convicted no further penalty. I do this on the basis that it is an aggravating feature of the offender’s supply charges that he was in fact supplying for profit. It would be quite wrong for me then to double count by imposing additional punishment on the dealing with property being a suspected proceeds of crime matter.
	
	
	For the offence of supplying 9.83 grams I impose a sentence consisting of a non-parole period of 15 months with a head sentence of 30 months to date from the day Mr Razzak went into custody 28 August 2014.
	
	
	For the offence of supplying 15.06 grams I take into account the two matters on the Form 1. I impose a sentence of 18 months non-parole period with a head sentence of 36 months to date from 28 November 2014.
	
	
	Thus the overall sentence consists of a non-parole period of 21 months with a head sentence of 39 months, the non-parole period expiring on 27 May 2016 on which day the offender is eligible to be released to parole.
	
	
	I’ll dismiss the backup charges and make confiscation orders by consent..

		12 February 2016",2015-07-08 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2703132,New South Wales Crime Commission v Weng [2015] NSWSC 996,"Judgment


	
	By summons filed on 1 July 2015, the plaintiff seeks various orders, including an order pursuant to s 10A of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 (NSW) (the Act) restraining dealings with any interest in property, including certain property described in Schedule One to the summons; an order pursuant to s 12(1)(b)(i) of the Act authorising the examination of the defendant concerning his financial affairs; an order pursuant to s 12(1)(c1) of the Act requiring the defendant to furnish to the plaintiff within 21 days a statement verified on oath setting out full particulars of all his property; an order pursuant to s 10B(2) of the Act that the New South Wales Trustee and Guardian take control of all of the defendant’s interests in the property specified in Schedule Two to the summons; and a proceeds assessment order pursuant to s 27 of the Act that the defendant pay to the Treasurer an amount assessed by the Court as the value of the proceeds of the defendant’s illegal activities within the period of six years before the filing of the application.
	
	
	The orders sought in the summons, apart from the proceeds assessment order under s 27 of the Act referred to above, were sought ex parte on the day of filing the summons, 1 July 2015.
	
	
	In support of its application the plaintiff relied on the following documents:
	


Affidavit of Jonathan Lee Spark sworn 30 June 2015; and

Statement of Facts and Circumstances relied on in an application for a restraining order and a proceeds assessment order pursuant to r 1.26 of the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW) dated 30 June 2015 (Statement of Facts and Circumstances).


	
	Section 10A of the Act relevantly provides:
	


“10A Proceedings for restraining orders

(1)   Application for order

The Commission may apply to the Supreme Court, ex parte, for a restraining order in respect of specified interests, a specified class of interests, or all the interests, in property of any person (including interests acquired after the making of the order).

…

(3)   The Commission may only apply for a restraining order that relates to interests in property derived from external serious crime related activity if the person who has the interests is domiciled in New South Wales or the property is situated in New South Wales.

(4)   Notice to affected person of application

Despite the application for a restraining order being made ex parte, the Supreme Court may, if it thinks fit, require the Commission to give notice of the application to a person who the Court has reason to believe has a sufficient interest in the application. A person who is required to be notified is entitled to appear and adduce evidence at the hearing of the application.

(5)   Determination of applications

The Supreme Court must make a restraining order if the application for the order is supported by an affidavit of an authorised officer stating that:

(a)   in the case of an application in respect of an interest referred to in subsection (1) - the authorised officer suspects that:

(i)   the person whose interest is the subject of the application has engaged in a serious crime related activity or serious crime related activities…

and stating the grounds on which that suspicion is based …

and the Court considers that, having regard to the matters contained in any such affidavit and any evidence adduced under subsection (4), there are reasonable grounds for any such suspicion.”


	
	The plaintiff’s application for an order under s 10A was made ex parte, as it is entitled to do under s 10A(1). I considered the documents relied upon in support of the application in chambers.
	
	
	The plaintiff’s application is supported by the affidavit of Jonathan Lee Spark sworn 30 June 2015. Mr Spark, who is an authorised officer of the plaintiff within the meaning of s 4(1) of the Act, deposes to his suspicion that the defendant has engaged in serious crime-related activity or crime-related activities, being: supplying a prohibited drug (methylamphetamine) of an amount greater than the commercial quantity of that drug contrary to s 25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW) (the DMTA). This is a serious criminal offence within the meaning of s 6(2)(b) of the Act because s 6(3) provides that offences under s 25 of the DMTA are “drug trafficking offences”. The Facts Sheet records that the defendant was arrested and charged with the offences described therein on 11 May 2015.
	
	
	Mr Spark sets out the grounds for his suspicion in [4] of his affidavit. He has annexed correspondence with Senior Constable Mark O’Reilly, the officer in charge of the investigation who had compiled the Facts Sheet. Senior Constable O’Reilly informed Mr Spark that the facts set out in the Facts Sheet are, to the best of his knowledge, true. He confirmed that it was prepared on the basis of the information provided by the initial reporting officers and from evidence he obtained when executing the search warrant.
	
	
	Mr Spark also deposed in his affidavit to investigations he caused to be made into the defendant’s property interests.
	
	
	Section 10A(5) provides, in substance, that I am obliged to make the order sought if the application is supported by an affidavit of an authorised officer stating that the officer suspects that the defendant has engaged in a crime related activity and setting out the grounds for the suspicion and I consider that, having regard to the matters contained in the affidavit, there are reasonable grounds for any such suspicion.
	
	
	In all the circumstances I am satisfied that Mr Spark’s affidavit meets the requirements of s 10A(5) as to the matters which he suspects.
	
	
	I am also satisfied, having regard to Mr Spark’s affidavit, that there are reasonable grounds for his suspicion. I have been guided by what the High Court said in George v Rockett [1990] HCA 26; 170 CLR 104 at [14].
	
	
	I do not consider that it would be appropriate to require the plaintiff to notify the defendant of the application under s 10A(4) in light of Mr Spark’s evidence. I accept Mr Spark’s evidence as to the speed with which real estate can be encumbered by unregistered mortages, which tends to have the effect of defeating the operation of the Act and restraining orders made under it.
	
	
	The defendant is domiciled in New South Wales and the real property is situated in New South Wales. Accordingly, the Commission is entitled to make this application for a restraining order: s 10A(3).
	
	
	The orders, other than the restraining order, are designed to ensure that the plaintiff is apprised of the full extent of the defendant’s property interests. These orders are, accordingly, ancillary to the restraining order which, in terms, restrains dealing with any interest the defendant may have in property as defined by s 7 of the Act. The Statement of Facts and Circumstances states that the plaintiff also seeks, in its summons, a proceeds assessment order pursuant to s 27 of the Act.
	
	
	In all the circumstances, I consider it to be appropriate to make the orders.
	
	
	I note the undertaking given by the solicitor for the plaintiff, being the usual undertaking as to damages.
	
	
	On the basis of that undertaking I make orders in terms of paragraphs 1 to 8 of the draft minute of order provided to me by the plaintiff.

2703134,New South Wales Crime Commission v Rashidi [2015] NSWSC 995,"Judgment


	
	By summons filed on 1 July 2015, the plaintiff seeks various orders, including an order pursuant to s 10A of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 (NSW) (the Act) restraining dealings with any interest in property, including certain property described in Schedule One to the summons; orders pursuant to s 12(1)(b)(i) of the Act authorising the examination of the defendant concerning her financial affairs; orders under s 12(1)(b)(ii) of the Act authorising the examination of Bobi Monteleone concerning the defendant’s financial affairs; an order pursuant to s 12(1)(c1) of the Act requiring the defendant to furnish to the plaintiff within 21 days a statement verified on oath setting out full particulars of all her property; and an order pursuant to s 28A of the Act that the defendant pay to the Treasurer an amount assessed by the Court as the value of the proceeds of her unexplained wealth.
	
	
	The orders sought in the summons, apart from the unexplained wealth order under s 28A of the Act referred to above, were sought ex parte on the day of filing the summons, 1 July 2015.
	
	
	In support of its application the plaintiff relied on the following documents:
	


Affidavit of Jonathan Lee Spark sworn 29 June 2015; and

Statement of Facts and Circumstances relied on in an application for a restraining order and an unexplained wealth order pursuant to r 1.26 of the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW) dated 29 June 2015 (Statement of Facts and Circumstances).


	
	Section 10A of the Act relevantly provides:
	


“10A Proceedings for restraining orders

(1)   Application for order

The Commission may apply to the Supreme Court, ex parte, for a restraining order in respect of specified interests, a specified class of interests, or all the interests, in property of any person (including interests acquired after the making of the order).

…

(3)   The Commission may only apply for a restraining order that relates to interests in property derived from external serious crime related activity if the person who has the interests is domiciled in New South Wales or the property is situated in New South Wales.

(4)   Notice to affected person of application

Despite the application for a restraining order being made ex parte, the Supreme Court may, if it thinks fit, require the Commission to give notice of the application to a person who the Court has reason to believe has a sufficient interest in the application. A person who is required to be notified is entitled to appear and adduce evidence at the hearing of the application.

(5)   Determination of applications

The Supreme Court must make a restraining order if the application for the order is supported by an affidavit of an authorised officer stating that:

(a)   in the case of an application in respect of an interest referred to in subsection (1) - the authorised officer suspects that:

(i)   the person whose interest is the subject of the application has engaged in a serious crime related activity or serious crime related activities…

and stating the grounds on which that suspicion is based …

and the Court considers that, having regard to the matters contained in any such affidavit and any evidence adduced under subsection (4), there are reasonable grounds for any such suspicion.”


	
	The plaintiff’s application for an order under s 10A was made ex parte, as it is entitled to do under s 10A(1). I considered the documents relied upon in support of the application in chambers.
	
	
	The plaintiff’s application is supported by the affidavit of Jonathan Lee Spark sworn 29 June 2015. Mr Spark, who is an authorised officer of the plaintiff within the meaning of s 4(1) of the Act, deposes to his suspicion that the defendant has engaged in serious crime-related activity or crime-related activities, being dishonestly obtaining a financial advantage by deception contrary to s 192E(1)(b) of the Crimes Act 1900. It is alleged that the defendant dishonestly obtained a loan from St George Bank, having provided false information in support of the application for the loan regarding her employment and taxable income. This is a serious criminal offence within the meaning of s 6(2)(d) of the Act because it is an offence that is punishable by imprisonment for 5 years or more and involves fraud.
	
	
	Mr Spark sets out the grounds for his suspicion in [4] of his affidavit. The deponent has annexed correspondence with Detective Senior Constable Robert Wahhab, who prepared the draft Facts Sheet on the basis of information he obtained during the investigation under Strike Force Sotun. Detective Senior Constable Wahhab informed Mr Spark that the facts set out are, to the best of his knowledge and belief, true.
	
	
	Mr Spark also deposed in his affidavit to investigations he has caused to be made into the defendant’s property interests.
	
	
	Section 10A(5) provides, in substance, that I am obliged to make the order sought if the application is supported by an affidavit of an authorised officer stating that the officer suspects that the defendant has engaged in a crime related activity and setting out the grounds for the suspicion and I consider that, having regard to the matters contained in the affidavit, there are reasonable grounds for any such suspicion.
	
	
	In all the circumstances I am satisfied that Mr Spark’s affidavit meets the requirements of s 10A(5) as to the matters which he suspects.
	
	
	I am also satisfied, having regard to Mr Spark’s affidavit, that there are reasonable grounds for his suspicion. I have been guided by what the High Court said in George v Rockett [1990] HCA 26; 170 CLR 104 at [14].
	
	
	I do not consider that it would be appropriate to require the plaintiff to notify the defendant of the application under s 10A(4) in light of Mr Spark’s evidence. I accept Mr Spark’s evidence as to the speed with which real estate can be encumbered, which tends to have the effect of defeating the operation of the Act and restraining orders made under it. Moreover, the defendant has, according to the draft Facts Sheet, not yet been charged. This is an additional reason for not requiring the plaintiff to notify the defendant of the application.
	
	
	The defendant is domiciled in New South Wales and the real property is situated in New South Wales. Accordingly, the Commission is entitled to make this application for a restraining order: s 10A(3).
	
	
	The orders, other than the restraining order, are designed to ensure that the plaintiff is apprised of the full extent of the defendant’s property interests. These orders are, accordingly, ancillary to the restraining order which, in terms, restrains dealing with any interest the defendant may have in property as defined by s 7 of the Act. The Statement of Facts and Circumstances states that the plaintiff also seeks, in its summons, an unexplained wealth order pursuant to s 28A of the Act.
	
	
	In all the circumstances, I consider it to be appropriate to make the orders.
	
	
	I note the undertaking given by the solicitor for the plaintiff, being the usual undertaking as to damages.
	
	
	On the basis of that undertaking I make orders in terms of paragraphs 1 to 8 of the draft minute of order provided to me by the plaintiff.

		23 July 2015",2015-06-30 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2703143,New South Wales Crime Commission v Nguyen [2015] NSWSC 993,"Judgment


	
	By summons filed on 1 July 2015, the plaintiff seeks various orders, including an order pursuant to s 10A of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 (NSW) (the Act) restraining dealings with any interest in property, including certain property described in Schedule One to the summons; orders pursuant to s 12(1)(b)(i) of the Act authorising the examination of the defendant concerning his financial affairs; orders pursuant to s 12(1)(b1) authorising the examination of Thuan Thi Huynh concerning the defendant’s financial affairs; an order pursuant to s 12(1)(c1) of the Act requiring the defendant to furnish to the plaintiff within 21 days a statement verified on oath setting out full particulars of all his property; and a proceeds assessment order pursuant to s 27 of the Act that the defendant pay to the Treasurer an amount assessed by the Court as the value of the proceeds of the defendant’s illegal activities within the period of six years before the filing of the application.
	
	
	The orders sought in the summons, apart from the proceeds assessment order under s 27 of the Act referred to above, were sought ex parte on the day of filing the summons, 1 July 2015.
	
	
	In support of its application the plaintiff relied on the following documents:
	


Affidavit of Jonathan Lee Spark sworn 30 June 2015; and

Statement of Facts and Circumstances relied on in an application for a restraining order and a proceeds assessment order pursuant to r 1.26 of the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW) dated 30 June 2015 (Statement of Facts and Circumstances).


	
	Section 10A of the Act relevantly provides:
	


“10A Proceedings for restraining orders

(1)   Application for order

The Commission may apply to the Supreme Court, ex parte, for a restraining order in respect of specified interests, a specified class of interests, or all the interests, in property of any person (including interests acquired after the making of the order).

…

(3)   The Commission may only apply for a restraining order that relates to interests in property derived from external serious crime related activity if the person who has the interests is domiciled in New South Wales or the property is situated in New South Wales.

(4)   Notice to affected person of application

Despite the application for a restraining order being made ex parte, the Supreme Court may, if it thinks fit, require the Commission to give notice of the application to a person who the Court has reason to believe has a sufficient interest in the application. A person who is required to be notified is entitled to appear and adduce evidence at the hearing of the application.

(5)   Determination of applications

The Supreme Court must make a restraining order if the application for the order is supported by an affidavit of an authorised officer stating that:

(a)   in the case of an application in respect of an interest referred to in subsection (1) - the authorised officer suspects that:

(i)   the person whose interest is the subject of the application has engaged in a serious crime related activity or serious crime related activities…

and stating the grounds on which that suspicion is based …

and the Court considers that, having regard to the matters contained in any such affidavit and any evidence adduced under subsection (4), there are reasonable grounds for any such suspicion.”


	
	The plaintiff’s application for an order under s 10A was made ex parte, as it is entitled to do under s 10A(1). I considered the documents relied upon in support of the application in chambers.
	
	
	The plaintiff’s application is supported by the affidavit of Jonathan Lee Spark sworn 30 June 2015. Mr Spark, who is an authorised officer of the plaintiff within the meaning of s 4(1) of the Act, deposes to his suspicion that the defendant has engaged in serious crime-related activity or crime-related activities, being: supplying a prohibited plant (cannabis) of an amount greater than the indictable quantity of that drug contrary to s 23(1)(b) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW) (the DMTA) and supplying a prohibited drug (cannabis) greater than the indictable quantity of that drug contrary to s 25(1) of the DMTA. These are serious criminal offences within the meaning of s 6(2)(b) of the Act because s 6(3) provides that offences under ss 23 and 25 of the DMTA are “drug trafficking offences”. The Facts Sheet records that the defendant was charged with the offences described therein on 21 May 2015 following the execution of a search warrant at his residence in Mount Pritchard.
	
	
	Mr Spark sets out the grounds for his suspicion in [4] of his affidavit. The deponent has annexed correspondence with Constable Shantel Fowler, who had prepared the Facts Sheet on the basis of information provided by investigating police officers. Constable Fowler informed Mr Spark that the facts set out are, to the best of her knowledge and belief, true.
	
	
	Mr Spark also deposed in his affidavit to investigations he caused to be made into the defendant’s property interests.
	
	
	Section 10A(5) provides, in substance, that I am obliged to make the order sought if the application is supported by an affidavit of an authorised officer stating that the officer suspects that the defendant has engaged in a crime related activity and setting out the grounds for the suspicion and I consider that, having regard to the matters contained in the affidavit, there are reasonable grounds for any such suspicion.
	
	
	In all the circumstances I am satisfied that Mr Spark’s affidavit meets the requirements of s 10A(5) as to the matters which he suspects.
	
	
	I am also satisfied, having regard to Mr Spark’s affidavit, that there are reasonable grounds for his suspicion. I have been guided by what the High Court said in George v Rockett [1990] HCA 26; 170 CLR 104 at [14].
	
	
	I do not consider that it would be appropriate to require the plaintiff to notify the defendant of the application under s 10A(4) in light of Mr Spark’s evidence. I accept Mr Spark’s evidence as to the speed with which real estate can be encumbered, which tends to have the effect of defeating the operation of the Act and restraining orders made under it.
	
	
	The defendant is domiciled in New South Wales and the real property is situated in New South Wales. Accordingly, the Commission is entitled to make this application for a restraining order: s 10A(3).
	
	
	The orders, other than the restraining order, are designed to ensure that the plaintiff is apprised of the full extent of the defendant’s property interests. These orders are, accordingly, ancillary to the restraining order which, in terms, restrains dealing with any interest the defendant may have in property as defined by s 7 of the Act. The Statement of Facts and Circumstances states that the plaintiff also seeks, in its summons, a proceeds assessment order pursuant to s 27 of the Act.
	
	
	In all the circumstances, I consider it to be appropriate to make the orders.
	
	
	I note the undertaking given by the solicitor for the plaintiff, being the usual undertaking as to damages.
	
	
	On the basis of that undertaking I make orders in terms of paragraphs 1 to 8 of the draft minute of order provided to me by the plaintiff.

		09 September 2015",2015-06-30 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2703163,In the Matter of Steven Smith [2015] NSWSC 832,"Judgment


	
	On 5 June 2015 Steven Smith (“the applicant”) made an application that I recuse myself from further hearing proceedings against him, those proceedings having been commenced by the Court for contempt in the face of the court. Although no motion was filed, the application was said to be based upon allegations of both actual and apprehended bias.
	
	
	After hearing evidence and submissions relevant to the application, I refused it. These are my reasons for so doing.
	


A Brief History of the Matter


	
	On 19 November 2010 the applicant and two others entered the home of Mr. Stanley Bruce Davies and, in the course of an attempt to rob Mr. Davies, savagely beat him to death. Each was subsequently charged with Mr. Davies’ murder.
	
	
	The applicant ultimately entered a plea of guilty to the charge, and to two other unrelated armed robbery offences. On 14 November 2013 he was sentenced to a term of 20 years imprisonment for the murder, with a non-parole period of 14 years. His earliest release date is 7 August 2030.
	
	
	The applicant was sentenced on the basis that he had played no part in the physical attack on the deceased and that, after his co-offenders had assaulted Mr. Davies, the applicant had tried to administer first aid to him.
	
	
	One of the applicant’s co-offenders was Raymond Kennedy, who similarly entered a plea of guilty to murder. In relation to Mr. Kennedy there was a factual dispute that had to be resolved prior to the imposition of sentence upon him. The dispute centred on his role in the murder of Mr. Davies and, specifically, whether he had himself visited violence upon Mr. Davies.
	
	
	The hearing of the dispute was listed for 13 March 2015 before me. As part of its case, the Crown proposed to call the applicant to give evidence. He was called from custody on that date.
	
	
	On being called to the witness box the applicant refused to sit down, refused to take an oath or affirmation, and refused to answer any questions asked of him. He refused to give his name, instead swearing fulsomely, and ultimately threatened court and Corrections officers by raising his fists and physically confronting them. He appeared to be about to strike a Corrections officer. His overall demeanour was threatening. For the safety of those in the Court the applicant was removed.
	
	
	Prior to his removal the applicant was warned about his conduct, and warned that the Court could deal with him for contempt. He was cautioned that the penalty for contempt could include a custodial term, and not one which would simply be absorbed into his extant sentence.
	
	
	The evidence that the Crown wished to lead from the applicant in the proceedings against Mr. Kennedy can be gleaned to a degree from some evidence tendered by the Crown (and ultimately rejected by the Court) in those proceedings.
	
	
	On the basis that the applicant was an unavailable witness within the meaning of s.65 of the Evidence Act 1995 the Crown sought to tender a copy of the statement of facts that had been before the court when the applicant was sentenced for his part in the murder of Mr. Davies, together with a transcript of a conversation between the applicant and others that had taken place on 5 November 2011, and which had been recorded by a lawfully deployed listening device.
	
	
	The relevance of the material to the Crown case was that in the recorded conversation, the contents of which was reflected in the statement of facts, the applicant had asserted that he had not himself struck or otherwise assaulted Mr. Davies, the violence having been meted out by his two co-offenders. The applicant had claimed that he had endeavoured to administer first aid to Mr. Davies, this being his only physical contact with him. The Crown sought to rely upon what it had anticipated the applicant would say in evidence (on the basis that he would give evidence consistent with the claims he made during the recorded conversation) to establish that Mr. Kennedy had participated in the assault upon the deceased.
	
	
	Although it is not possible to know fully the nature of the questions that may have been asked of the applicant in cross-examination, it is likely that Mr. Kennedy would have sought to put to and establish through the applicant, that he had not entered Mr. Davies’ house until well after the applicant and the third co-offender had effected entry, and that, contrary to the assertions of the applicant in the recorded conversation, Mr. Kennedy had played no role in the assault upon the deceased.
	
	
	Both parties to the proceedings in R v Kennedy [2015] NSWSC 327 had anticipated that the applicant could give evidence consistent with the case each respectively sought to advance. Both were deprived of the opportunity to place such evidence before the Court by the applicant’s conduct.
	
	
	After he was returned to custody and given an opportunity to reflect on his conduct and what was required of him as a witness, the applicant was required to return to the Courtroom. He refused to do so. Accordingly, the Court convened in the cells at the Court House, and the applicant was asked to reconsider his refusal to testify. He maintained his refusal.
	
	
	He was accordingly orally charged by the Court with three counts of contempt, it being contempt in the face of the court, to be dealt with summarily by the Court. The charges are as follows:
	


Count 1: Steven Smith you are hereby charged with contempt of court in that, on 13 March 2015, in the Supreme Court of New South Wales at Darlinghurst in the State of New South Wales, in proceedings before me between the Crown and Raymond Kennedy, you did refuse to take an oath or affirmation when called upon to do so as a witness in the proceedings and you did thereby conduct yourself in a manner that had a real tendency to interfere with the administration of justice.

Count 2: You are further charged with contempt of court in that, on 13 March 2015, in the Supreme Court of New South Wales at Darlinghurst in the State of New South Wales, in proceedings before me between the Crown and Raymond Kennedy, you did refuse to answer questions when called upon to do so as a witness in the proceedings and you did thereby conduct yourself in a manner that had a real tendency to interfere with the administration of justice.

Count 3: You are further charged with contempt of court in that, on 13 March 2015, in the Supreme Court of New South Wales at Darlinghurst in the State of New South Wales, in proceedings before me between the Crown and Raymond Kennedy, you did threaten unlawful violence against an officer of the court, and you did thereby conduct yourself in a manner that had a real tendency to interfere with the administration of justice.


	
	The charges were laid pursuant to Part 55 of the Supreme Court Rules 1970.
	
	
	The power to punish contempt in the face of the court is part of the inherent jurisdiction of the Supreme Court: R v Metal Trades Employers Association; Ex Parte Amalgamated Engineering Union (1951) 82 CLR 208 at 241 – 243. It is a critical and necessary power to ensure that the authority of the court is maintained: Balogh v St Albans Crown Court [1975] 1 QB 73 at 85.
	
	
	The applicant having refused to give evidence, and having been charged, the proceedings against him were adjourned to allow him an opportunity to obtain legal advice.
	
	
	Although charges for contempt in the face of the court are ordinarily dealt with expeditiously, there was thereafter some delay whilst the applicant obtained legal assistance and readied his case.
	
	
	The Crown Advocate, Ms. Adams SC, was briefed by the Crown Solicitor (as a courtesy to the Court) to provide assistance amicus curiae. Mr. Carroll appeared for the applicant. Counsel provided submissions to the Court as to the way in which the matter should proceed, with each submitting (Ms. Adams SC in written submissions; Mr. Carroll via e-mail agreeing with Ms. Adams) that it was a matter for the Court.
	
	
	Notwithstanding that position, when the matter was mentioned on 28 May 2015 to fix a date for the contempt to be dealt with, the applicant sought to have proceedings referred to the prothonotary to “be commenced” (T1:28 of 28.5.2015). Proceedings having been commenced on 13 March 2015, that application was refused.
	
	
	The applicant thereupon entered a plea of not guilty to each of the three charges against him, and the matter was adjourned for hearing of his defence to 5 June 2015.
	
	
	Pursuant to r3 of Division 2 of Part 55 of the Supreme Court Rules, the procedure for a contemnor brought before the Court and charged, as this applicant was, is to require him to make a defence.
	


3 Charge, defence and determination

Where the contemnor is brought before the Court, the Court shall:

(a) cause him to be informed orally of the contempt with which he is charged,

(b) require him to make his defence to the charge,

(c) after hearing him, determine the matter of the charge, and

(d) make an order for the punishment or discharge of the applicant.


	
	Ordinarily, evidence called in the course of any defence is to be by affidavit.
	


8 Evidence

(1) Subject to subrule (2), the evidence in support of the charge shall be by affidavit.

(2) The Court may, on terms, permit evidence in support of the charge to be given otherwise than by affidavit.


	
	There is no “prosecution case” as such because the applicant was charged by the Court and the Court is entitled to rely upon the presiding judge’s observations of the applicant’s conduct in the face and hearing of the Court: Fraser v The Queen [1984] 3 NSWLR 212 at 227 per Kirby P and McHugh JA.
	


The Application Made on 5 June 2015


	
	On 5 June 2015, rather than being ready to make his defence to the three charges, the applicant made an application to the Court asking that I disqualify myself from further hearing the matter. Counsel for the applicant relied upon what was asserted in submission to be both actual and apprehended bias to ground the application. As Mr. Carroll put it,
	


“There is certainly an overriding principle that an application to disqualify yourself is a live matter in these proceedings” (T1:50 – T2:01, 5.6.2015).


	
	Reliance was placed upon Clampert v Attorney General of the Commonwealth of Australia [2009] FCAFC 151 in support of the application.
	


The Applicant’s Case


	
	In support of his application the applicant tendered the following material:
	



	
	The transcript of R v Kennedy of 13.3.205;
	
	
	R v Kennedy [2015] NSWSC 327;
	
	
	R v Steven John Smith [2013] NSWSC 1723;
	
	
	Transcript of the recorded conversation of 5.11.2011 involving the applicant;
	
	
	Prosecution Guidelines issued by the Director of Public Prosecutions (“DPPG”), guideline 16 (informer witnesses), guideline 19 (victims of crime), guideline 26 (witnesses);
	
	
	Report of Anita Duffy, psychologist, of 4.11.2013;
	
	
	Printed accounts of e-mail correspondence between my Chambers, the Crown Advocate and the applicant’s representatives during the period of the remand;
	
	
	Statement of Geoffrey Little of 2.6.2015;
	
	
	Statement of John Egan of 1.6.2015;
	
	
	Statement of Stephen Notias of 29.5.2015.
	



	
	Some of this material, such as items (iii) to (vi), seemed to have no relevance to an application to me to recuse myself, and Mr. Carroll did not, despite requests that he do so, articulate the relevance of the material. I rejected the tender of items (iv) and (vi) because of the absence of any submission that could establish relevance.
	
	
	Ordinarily, there is an expectation that the party asking a judge to recuse himself or herself will identify the issues for the determination of the judge, articulate the conduct that gives rise to the apprehension of bias, and set out the connection between the conduct and the issues to be determined: Barakat v Goritsas (No 2) [2012] NSWCA 36 The submissions advanced by the applicant did not approach the matter in this way, and I had some difficulty in identifying precisely what the application relied upon to establish bias.
	
	
	The applicant did not distinguish the evidence relied upon to establish actual bias from that which was relied upon as relevant to apprehended bias. It may be that the whole of the evidence was asserted to establish both actual and apprehended bias, and so I have approached the matter in that way.
	
	
	The application and the case for both actual and apprehended bias appears to have relied upon the following circumstances.
	
	
	During the proceedings in R v Kennedy of 13 March 2015 when the applicant was called to give evidence, and after his refusal to take an oath or affirmation, or to give evidence, I warned the applicant that he could be charged with contempt of court, and that the penalty for such a charge could include a custodial penalty which could be imposed cumulatively upon his existing sentence:
	


“WITNESS: I’m not fucking talking.

HER HONOUR: You’re in a courtroom.

“WITNESS: I don’t give a fuck, right?

HER HONOUR: All right. Let me warn you of this.

WITNESS: What?

HER HONOUR: You’re serving a sentence now aren’t you?

WITNESS: Yeah.

HER HONOUR: If you behave in the way you are behaving in this Court, if you refuse to answer questions--

WITNESS: What else can you do?

HER HONOUR: If you swear in this Court in the way you are--

WITNESS: What else can you fucking do?

HER HONOUR: Just listen to me--

WITNESS: Just hurry the fuck up won’t you.

HER HONOUR: If you swear in the way you are now you can be dealt with for contempt.

WITNESS: That’s all right.

HER HONOUR: Well it won’t be a sentence for contempt that will just run concurrent with your existing sentence--

WITNESS: I don’t care.

HER HONOUR: It will be time on top, do you understand?

WITNESS: ..(not transcribable)..

COURT OFFICER: Sit down--

WITNESS: I’m not fucking ..(not transcribable)..

COURT OFFICER: Sit down. Do you want me - sit down, come on, sit down.

WITNESS: ..(not transcribable)..

COURT OFFICER: Listen to the judge--

WITNESS: Fuck the judge, fuck you, I’m ..(not transcribable).” (R v Kennedy, (T6:19 – T7:20, 13.3.15)):


	
	The applicant submitted that this warning was evidence capable of establishing that the issue of penalty had been pre-judged, before such time as charges had been laid. As counsel for the applicant put it, importing the test for apprehended bias:
	


“Whether a fair-minded observer would think that the sentence hearing in respect of any evidence of why it has transpired that way and whether or not objectively a reasonable person would think that your Honour’s statement there would not necessarily curtail your sentencing discretion” (T7.09, 5.6.15)


	
	The applicant relied upon purported differences between the accounts of the applicant’s conduct in the face of the court on 13 March 2015 given by three court officials (items (viii), (ix), and (x) above), and as particularised in the third charge. How this supported an accusation of actual bias or apprehended bias was not set out by Mr. Carroll and it is not clear to me.
	
	
	Reliance was placed upon [36] and [38] of R v Kennedy to assert that I had concluded that the applicant and Mr. Kennedy had “conspir[ed] to lie to assist” (T7:36 of 5.6.2015). The relevant paragraphs are:
	


“[36] Mr. Smith, who is presently in custody serving a lengthy sentence which will see him in prison until at least 7 August 2030, refused to take an oath or affirmation, and refused to answer any questions, even to give his own name. In Court he swore extravagantly and threatened physical violence to court staff and Corrective Services officers, actually raising his fists and moving to strike staff on a number of occasions. His conduct was such that he represented a significant risk to the safety of all officials present in the court room, and I had him removed from the Court.

[38] Although the offender did not give evidence and so what he asserts about these events is largely unknown, having regard to evidence before the Court relevant to his application to reverse his plea, it is open to infer that the offender may have expected Steven Smith to resile from the account he gave on 5 November 2011, and support the offender’s claims that he had no prior knowledge of the purpose of attending Mr. Davies’ home, and did not himself ever strike Mr. Davies, touching him only to try to assist him.”


	
	Counsel referred the Court to R v Kennedy ibid at [41] to establish that I held an opinion that the basis upon which the applicant was sentenced – that is, on the basis that he had played no part in the infliction of violence upon the deceased and had attempted to administer first aid to him – was incorrect, and that “he is physically responsible for the death of the deceased” (T8:21 of 5.6.2015).
	
	
	Mr. Carroll submitted that, in circumstances where the applicant is a person who functions at a low level intellectually (items (iii) and (vi) above) whether or not I had treated the applicant fairly as a witness before the Court would be a live issue in his case in defence of the contempt charges. The DPP Prosecution Guidelines (item (v) above) were said to be relevant to this aspect of the matter. As I understand the argument, the applicant asserted that, prior to being called to give evidence in R v Kennedy, the Crown Prosecutor should have spoken to him in conference, and the Director’s guidelines relevant to vulnerable witnesses followed, particularly by the allocation to him of a Witness Assistance Officer.
	
	
	Further, legal advice should have been obtained for him by either the Crown or, failing that, by the Court, as there was a risk that he could incriminate himself in other crimes during his anticipated evidence. These crimes are asserted to be offences of conceal serious offence, supply prohibited drug, possess and self-administer a prohibited drug, all from 2011 or thereabouts. Mr. Carroll submitted that the risk of self-incrimination for these offences arose as there were admissions to or depictions of such conduct in the recording of the listening device of 5.11.2011, which may or would be played to the applicant in court during the proceedings against Mr. Kennedy. This submission was made despite the fact that the recording had been before the sentencing court when the applicant was sentenced, and the latter two offences were statute barred.
	
	
	As I understand the applicant’s submission, there was an obligation on the Court to see that the applicant was afforded the services of a Witness Assistance Officer and other courtesies contemplated by the DPPG, and to ensure that he had access to legal advice prior to giving evidence. My purported failure to attend to these things was relied upon as both relevant to actual bias, and as relevant to apprehended bias, in that the applicant proposed to rely upon these “failures” in his defence of the contempt charges.
	
	
	In relation to the e-mail correspondence tendered by the applicant (item (vii) above), counsel was initially unwilling to make any submission as to its relevance to the question of actual or apprehended bias. When pressed to explain what the Court was to make of evidence that he had tendered, it was submitted that the correspondence (between my Associate, the Crown Advocate, and Mr. Carroll) was evidence that I personally had made inquiries as to whether or not the applicant had a current Notice of Intention to Appeal against the sentence imposed upon him for the murder of Mr. Davies, as a means of testing the honesty of counsel for the applicant.
	
	
	In a submission that I continue to find inexplicable, even at some small temporal distance from the events, Mr. Carroll asserted that the fact that my Associate obtained from the Court’s computer record information as to the status of any NIA filed by the applicant, and conveyed it to the Crown Advocate and Mr. Carroll for their assistance, was evidence of an attempt by me to “test my [Mr. Carroll’s] honesty” (T11:30 of 5.6.2015). That purported “test” of counsel’s honesty was relied upon (as I understand it) as evidence of actual bias.
	
	
	Mr. Carroll referred the Court to Clampert at [35] – [39], which he submitted was an example of the application of the law in a case directly comparable to the present matter. Those paragraphs of the judgment (of Black CJ) state:
	


“[35] Cases of the highest authority warn that the summary power of punishing for contempt, in circumstances where the judge before whom the alleged contempt occurred then goes on to hear the matter, should be used sparingly and only in serious cases: see Lewis v Judge Ogden (1984) 153 CLR 682 at 693 per Mason, Murphy, Wilson, Brennan and Dawson JJ.

[36] Likewise in Keeley v Mr Justice Brooking (1979) 143 CLR 162 at 173-174, Stephen J, having reviewed the authorities, including Balogh v St. Albans Crown Court [1975] QB 73 observed that the conclusion to be drawn from them (a conclusion with which he evidently agreed) was that:

… summary procedure for contempt not only should be employed most sparingly but should rarely be resorted to except in those exceptional cases where the conduct is such that ‘it cannot wait to be punished’ because it is ‘urgent and imperative to act immediately’ to preserve the integrity of ‘a trial in progress or about to start’.

[37] It is obvious and well recognised that the essential problem with a summary hearing before the judicial officer before whom the contempt was allegedly committed is the conflict with fundamental principles of justice that occurs when, in effect, the roles of prosecutor, witness and judge are performed by one and same person: see Keeley 143 CLR 162 at 173 per Stephen J. Specific aspects of the problem emerge when interruptions said to amount to a contempt of court take the form of insults that may be seen to reflect upon, or be aimed at, the judicial officer who will decide the case and who must then exercise the wide discretionary power to impose a penalty; and even the more so when the penalty may be (as here) a term of imprisonment.

[38] There is yet a further problem. Contempt in the face of the court is a criminal offence yet when a person is charged with such an offence in circumstances such as those in this case, the onus of proof is in effect reversed. Instead of a case for the prosecution being presented by a prosecutor and tested by or on behalf of the person accused in proceedings presided over by an independent judge or magistrate, in a case such as the present the accused stands charged and is required to justify or otherwise defend his or her conduct.

[39] Whilst these considerations do not preclude a summary hearing by the judge or magistrate before whom a contempt is said to have occurred, they are at the heart of the concerns expressed about such a procedure in the cases and in academic writings, and they underscore the need for caution. They also point to the matters that must be considered and given appropriate weight in the exercise of the discretion conferred by provisions such as s 17(3) of the Act. If fundamental principles of justice are to be departed from it must surely be for the reason that, quite exceptionally, the broader interests of justice so require. Indeed, this consideration is so strong that if the same person were to act as prosecutor, witness and judge when the broader interests of justice did not manifestly so require, proceedings intended to uphold the authority of the court would be seen to diminish that authority so that the process would, at best, be self-defeating.”

The Submissions of the Crown Advocate


	
	It should be noted that Ms. Adams SC appeared in this matter amicus curiae, as a courtesy to the Court extended by the Attorney General. Her role was simply to assist the Court given the unusual nature of the proceedings, and the absence of a traditional prosecutor.
	
	
	She was asked to respond to the applicant’s application without having had notice of it, and without having had the opportunity to consider it fully.
	
	
	The Crown Advocate submitted that, while it cannot be said that an application to recuse on the basis of bias could never succeed in contempt proceedings, that was not the situation in the present circumstances. She submitted that, in order to succeed, the applicant must identify with precision those matters he says may lead me to decide the issues in this matter other than on its factual and legal merits. Further, he must outline the logical connection between those matters suggesting bias and the feared deviation from deciding the matters according to law. Thirdly, the application must be based on material outside the objective acts forming the charges of contempt as observed by the court; that is, the fact that I observed the acts committed by the applicant, and thus formed a view that he was in contempt of court, cannot of itself indicate that I have prejudged the matter such as to justify an application for disqualification.
	
	
	In response to specific matters raised by Mr. Carroll, Ms. Adams SC submitted that the cases where contemnors were afforded opportunity to obtain legal advice prior to being charged with contempt were trial matters involving a jury, where such a course was taken to avoid a danger of the trial aborting, rather than in compliance with principle. Access to a legal practitioner is usually organised by the party calling the witness, rather than the court itself.
	
	
	Ms Adams SC submitted that the warning issued to the applicant on 13 March 2015 as to the possible consequences of his actions was sufficient and in accordance with established authority and legislative requirements.
	
	
	The Crown Advocate referred the Court to Gaudrie v Local Court (NSW) and Another [2013] NSWSC 1425; (2013) 235 A Crim R 98.
	


Consideration


	
	The applicant’s application relied upon assertions of both actual bias, and a reasonable apprehension of bias.
	
	
	The determination of whether there is actual bias involves a determination of fact which must be resolved in light of the matters raised by the applicant (and summarised at [34] to [43] above) and asserted by him to disclose bias. The test of actual bias is a more stringent test than that which applies to apprehended bias: McGovern v Ku-ring-gai Council [2008] NSWCA 209; 72 NSWLR 504 at [73].That is appropriate, since an allegation of actual bias is a most serious matter. Inhering in it is an allegation that the judicial officer is in breach of his or her oath of office.
	
	
	Where actual bias is alleged, as it is here, the allegation can be made good only by evidence which establishes that the decision maker is actually biased. Brereton J, in Carbotech-Australia Pty Ltd v Yates [2008] NSWSC 540, said:
	


""[….] actual bias depends not upon the impression of any reasonable bystander, but upon proof that the decision maker is actually biased"" (at [45]).


	
	If, as a matter of fact, it is determined that the judicial officer is actually biased, then the judicial officer must recuse himself or herself, because to continue to preside would be to act contrary to the judicial oath.
	
	
	The determination of whether there is apprehended bias involves consideration of the facts established by evidence and the application of the relevant legal tests to those facts.
	
	
	In relation to apprehended bias, the question is whether a fair-minded lay observer might reasonably apprehend that the judge might not bring an impartial or unprejudiced mind to the issues to be determined: Johnson v Johnson (2000) 201 CLR 488 at 492.
	
	
	The relevant lay observer is taken to be a reasonable and fair-minded individual who, although without legal training or experience, is not wholly ignorant of legal matters, and is informed of the basic issues relevant to a fair assessment of all of the circumstances.
	


“The bystander would be taken to know commonplace things, such as the fact that adjudicators sometimes say, or do, things that they might later wish they had not, without necessarily disqualifying themselves from continuing to exercise their powers. The bystander must also now be taken to have, at least in a very general way, some knowledge of the fact that an adjudicator may properly adopt reasonable efforts to confine proceedings within appropriate limits and to ensure that time is not wasted. The fictitious bystander will also be aware of the strong professional pressures on adjudicators (reinforced by the facilities of appeal and review) to uphold traditions of integrity and impartiality. Acting reasonably, the fictitious bystander would not reach a hasty conclusion based on the appearance evoked by an isolated episode of temper or remarks to the parties or their representatives, which was taken out of context. Finally, a reasonable member of the public is neither complacent nor unduly sensitive or suspicious:” Johnson v Johnson (2000) 201 CLR 488 at 508. [Footnotes omitted.]


	
	That the apprehensions of the fair minded lay observer are reasonable is a feature of the test which is of importance: Laws v Australian Broadcasting Tribunal (1990) 170 CLR 70 at 100.
	
	
	If apprehended bias is to be established, the lay observer must reasonably apprehend that the judge’s mind is so prejudiced in favour of a particular opinion formed or conclusion reached as to be unlikely to alter that view or conclusion, notwithstanding the evidence placed before the court or the submissions made to it: Kwan v Kang & Ors [2003] NSWCA 336 at [83]. It is not a question of whether the judge will decide the issue to be determined adversely to a party, but rather that the issue will be decided other than impartially and without prejudice: Re JRL; Ex Parte CJL (1986) 161 CLR 342 at 352; R v Masters (1992) 26 NSWLR 450 at 471.
	
	
	It has been held that the courts must apply realistic criteria in considering whether a reasonable apprehension of bias has been made out.
	


“Whilst the fictional observer, by reference to whom the test is formulated, is not to be assumed to have a detailed knowledge of the law, or of the character or ability of a particular judge, the reasonableness of any suggested apprehension of bias is to be considered in the context of ordinary judicial practice. The rules and conventions governing such practice are not frozen in time. They develop to take account of the exigencies of modern litigation. At the trial level, modern judges, responding to a need for more active case management, intervene in the conduct of cases to an extent that may surprise a person who came to court expecting a judge to remain, until the moment of pronouncement of judgment, as inscrutable as the Sphinx. In Vakauta v Kelly Brennan, Deane and Gaudron JJ, referring both to trial and appellate proceedings, spoke of “the dialogue between Bench and Bar which is so helpful in the identification of real issues and real problems in a particular case”. Judges, at trial or appellate level, who, in exchanges with counsel, express tentative views which reflect a certain tendency of mind, are not on that account alone to be taken to indicate prejudgment. Judges are not expected to wait until the end of a case before they start thinking about the issues, or to sit mute while evidence is advanced and arguments are presented. On the contrary, they will often form tentative opinions on matters in issue, and counsel are usually assisted by hearing those opinions, and being given an opportunity to deal with them”: Johnson v Johnson (2000) 201 CLR 488 at 493. [Footnotes omitted.]


	
	The application of realistic criteria is of particular relevance in a matter such as the present, where the judge who brings a charge of contempt in the face of the court is witness, prosecutor, and judge.
	
	
	The test for apprehended bias is to be applied in two steps:
	


“The apprehension of bias principle admits of the possibility of human frailty. Its application is as diverse as human frailty. Its application requires two steps. First, it requires the identification of what it is said might lead a judge (or juror) to decide a case other than on its legal and factual merits. The second step is no less important. There must be an articulation of the logical connection between the matter and the feared deviation from the course of deciding the case on its merits. The bare assertion that a judge (or juror) has an “interest” in litigation, or an interest in a party to it, will be of no assistance until the nature of the interest, and the asserted connection with the possibility of departure from impartial decision making, is articulated. Only then can the reasonableness of the asserted apprehension of bias be assessed”: Ebner v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy [2000] HCA 63; 205 CLR 337 at [8].


	
	It is important that the question of bias or apprehended bias is determined objectively, by the application of legal principle to established fact. It is a difficult, even unpleasant, position for a judge to be asked to consider his or her own conduct, and determine whether that conduct is such as to establish actual prejudice or to cause the fair minded lay observer, with all of the qualities referred to above, to reasonably apprehend bias in the judicial officer. It is therefore particularly important to approach the matter by the strict application of legal principle to evidence, lest a fundamental element of our system of justice – its impartiality – be compromised.
	
	
	If actual bias is established, the judicial officer must without question recuse himself or herself. In cases of apprehended bias the judicial officer should recuse him or herself only where a reasonable apprehension is “firmly established”: R v Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission; Ex Parte Angliss Group (1969) 122 CLR 546 at 553 – 554; Re JRL; Ex Parte CJL op cit.
	
	
	As to the latter proposition,
	


“Although it is important that justice must be seen to be done, it is equally important that judicial officers discharge their duty to sit and do not, by acceding too readily to suggestions of appearance of bias, encourage parties to believe that by seeking the disqualification of a judge, they will have their case tried by someone thought to be more likely to decide the case in their favour”: Re JRL; Ex Parte CJL at 352.

What are the Issues for Determination?


	
	In the somewhat unusual circumstances that apply to proceedings for charges brought by the court for contempt in its face, where the court has already concluded that contempt has been committed, and is aware from observation of the facts of the contempt, the issue or issues to be determined in the proceedings relevant to the applicant could only relate to the defence to be advanced by him to the charges pursuant to r.3 of the Supreme Court Rules 1970, and any penalty that may be imposed.
	
	
	Although the full nature of his defence was not identified by the applicant in submission to the Court on the application for disqualification, some aspects of it can be gleaned from what was advanced, being a contention that he was not treated fairly as a witness, and that a Notice of Intention to Appeal filed in relation to the murder and armed robbery matters was of relevance to the applicant’s status as a witness.
	
	
	In the event of a conviction, the other issue for determination would be the appropriate penalty to be imposed.
	


What is the Conduct Identified as Relevant to Bias?


	
	As I apprehend it, the alleged conduct pointed to by the applicant as capable of establishing actual or apprehended bias is:
	



	
	The failure to treat the applicant fairly as a witness;
	
	
	The warning given to Mr. Smith on 13 March 2015 as to the possible consequences of his conduct in court;
	
	
	A conclusion purportedly reached that the applicant and Mr. Kennedy had conspired to lie about the events surrounding the murder of Mr. Davies;
	
	
	A conclusion purportedly reached by me that the applicant was physically responsible for the death of Mr. Davies; and
	
	
	A view that I purportedly held that Mr. Carroll’s personal honesty was to be doubted.
	


What is the Connection between the Issues to be Decided and the Conduct Identified Such as to Demonstrate Bias?


	
	Some of the conduct relied upon by the applicant cannot have any connection to or bearing on the issues to be decided by the Court in the proceedings relevant to contempt, even if the alleged conduct was established as a matter of fact. Other alleged conduct was not established by the evidence.
	
	
	Those matters referred to at [69d] and [69e] above fall into the former category.
	
	
	The conclusion that the applicant imputes to me that he was physically responsible for the death of Stanley Davies ([69d]), even if it could be established that I actually held such a view, or that the fair-minded lay observer might reasonably apprehend that I did, could have no relevance to the issues that the Court is likely to have to determine, being the applicant’s defence to the charges of contempt, and any penalty that may ultimately be required to be imposed.
	
	
	The issue of the applicant’s role in a separate crime on a separate occasion, it being of an entirely different nature to contempt in the face of the court, is irrelevant.
	
	
	Even if it were relevant, the applicant’s assertion as to the view I hold is based upon a misreading of the judgment in R v Kennedy that cannot be supported after sensible consideration of the impugned passages. The reference in that judgment to the applicant’s possible contribution to the physical attack on Mr. Davies was made in the context of assessing the role of Mr. Kennedy, not that of the applicant. That assessment was required as part of the sentencing exercise, and to resolve the disputed facts.
	
	
	Similarly, a view purportedly held by a judicial officer about a particular legal representative ([69e]) can have no connection to the issues to be determined in dealing with the contempt of that legal representative’s client, even were an adverse view in fact held of counsel.
	
	
	There is no basis to conclude that animus between the bench and counsel – if it existed - could ever be a relevant consideration in the determination of an issue before the court involving another individual.
	
	
	Even if alleged animus did or could have a connection to the determination of the relevant issues, here there is no evidence at all to establish actual bias against the applicant by reason of some adverse assessment of counsel. Whilst counsel may have had a perception that I had set out to “test” his honesty when my Associate ascertained the status of any NIA, a perception may be reasonable or unreasonable, but either way falls very far from being capable of proving actual bias.
	
	
	Nor do I consider the circumstances relating to this aspect of the alleged bias as being such as to give rise to a reasonable apprehension in the fair-minded lay observer that I may have been prejudiced against the applicant, and unable to bring an impartial mind to bear on the issues to be decided. Among the many qualities imputed to the notional lay observer is an understanding of the professional training and experience of judicial officers, whose “training, tradition and oath or affirmation requires [the judge] to discard the irrelevant, the immaterial, and the prejudicial”: Vakauta v Kelly (1988) 13 NSWLR 502 at 527 and 584-585.
	
	
	A negative view of counsel, if held by a judge, is readily set aside in accordance with the judge’s training, tradition, and oath. Indeed, one might go so far as to say that this occurs on a regular basis in our courts.
	
	
	For those matters which could have a connection to the issues to be determined in relation to the proceedings for contempt, set out at [69a], [69b], and [69c] above, I do not regard actual or apprehended bias as having been established by evidence.
	
	
	The evidence does not in my view establish my purported failure to treat Mr. Smith fairly as a witness ([69a]).
	
	
	Criteria must be reasonably applied, and here, that must involve attention to the prevailing circumstances. Those circumstances included the fact that Mr. Smith, a man convicted of a particularly violent murder and serving a lengthy sentence for his crime, was an unwilling witness, and may have posed a security risk to the court.
	
	
	Although Mr. Carroll submitted that there was some obligation on the Court to ensure that the applicant was treated in accordance with the DPPG no authority in support of that proposition was identified, and nor have I found any in my subsequent researches. Common sense suggests that there is no such obligation.
	
	
	Firstly, the DPPG does not bind any court. The Guidelines are intended for Crown Prosecutors and others who act for the Director of Public Prosecutions; they do not have even an instructive role for judicial officers. In the proceedings against Raymond Kennedy, it was a matter for the Crown as to whether or not the applicant was called, and whether or not he was treated by the Crown in the same way as, for example, a witness who was an indigenous victim of sexual assault, as Mr. Carroll contended was appropriate. It was no business of the Court to ensure that the Crown Prosecutor spoke to Mr Smith in conference before he was called to give evidence, or to see that a Witness Assistance Officer, being an employee of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, was present to provide support to Mr. Smith in his capacity as a witness.
	
	
	Neither was it the Court’s role to ensure the applicant was provided with legal advice on the speculative basis that he may have been asked a question the answer to which could incriminate him in some crime. The thrust of Mr. Carroll’s argument in this regard was that the Court was aware from the contents of the transcript of the recorded conversation of 5.11.2011 that the applicant had spoken about the commission of other crimes, and was therefore at risk of self-incrimination. That submission overlooks the fact that the relevant transcript had already been tendered to the court that sentenced the applicant for murder, and was in those proceedings relied upon by the Crown as an admission, and not disputed to be such by the applicant. Any danger of self-incrimination was well and truly at large. If the witness had taken an oath or affirmation, and answered questions, and was asked a problematic question, appropriate steps could have been taken at that time to safeguard his rights. That point was never reached.
	
	
	Whilst Counsel referred to other cases in which a witness in danger of being dealt with for contempt was given an opportunity to obtain legal advice, such as R v Bilal Razzak [2006] NSWSC 1366 where Bell J (as her Honour then was) offered that opportunity to a witness subsequently charged with contempt, the cases relied upon involved a trial before a jury (with a consequent risk of the trial miscarrying and a jury being discharged) and, it would appear from the cases, a witness who was not physically threatening those around him.
	
	
	In the proceedings against Mr. Kennedy, there was no jury, and no realistic prospect of polite conversation with a witness who refused even to sit down in the witness box, and whose very demeanour was an unstated threat from the outset.
	
	
	Whilst one can always see in hindsight how matters may have been better managed, there is no obligation on a court dealing with contumacious contempt to do other than warn the witness of the possible consequences of his or her actions. That being the case, the evidence relied upon (being the transcript of 13 March 2015) cannot prove actual bias.
	
	
	Nor can it establish apprehended bias in my judgment, bearing in mind the need to realistically apply the relevant criteria, and imputing to the fair-minded lay observer knowledge of the whole of the circumstances of Mr. Smith’s presentation in the court room on 13 March 2013, and the obligations that operated on the Court.
	
	
	The allegation of pre-judgment of penalty relevant to contempt ([69b] above) relies upon my warning to the applicant on 13 March 2015, set out above at [34], prior to him being charged with contempt in the face of the court. The applicant asserts that the warning given was a pre-judgment, but that mistakes the function of the warning. In all cases where an individual is behaving in such a way as to be in danger of being charged with contempt in the face of the court, the court is obliged to warn the individual of the risk that his or her conduct, if persisted with, may constitute contempt, which carries a penalty including the possibility of a prison sentence.
	
	
	In circumstances such as those that applied in the present case, where the relevant individual was already serving a sufficiently lengthy sentence as to regard himself as immune to any punishment that could be imposed (asking rhetorically “what can you do”), it was important to ensure that it was clearly understood that the penalty could include a sentence that would represent an additional term of imprisonment.
	
	
	I do not accept that anything recorded in the transcript of 13 March 2015 is capable of establishing actual bias.
	
	
	In terms of what a fair-minded lay observer might reasonably apprehend, on the basis that that observer ought be taken to understand the obligation of the court to warn a potential contemnor of the possible consequences of his or her actions, I am unable to conclude that the observer would regard my warning to the applicant as other than such a required warning.
	
	
	The final matter relied upon by the applicant as evidencing actual and / or apprehended bias was that set out at [69c] above, an assertion that I had concluded that the applicant and Mr. Kennedy had conspired to lie in some way (precisely what way is not altogether clear to me).
	
	
	This allegation is based upon a discrete paragraph in R v Kennedy, ([38] of the judgment, extracted at [37] above). The applicant submitted that this paragraph discloses my conclusion that he and Mr. Kennedy had colluded in some way as to the evidence the applicant would give about the circumstances of the murder. The submission is based upon a misreading of the judgment.
	
	
	The impugned section in fact refers to the expectations that Mr. Kennedy might be assumed to have held that the applicant would, if called as a witness, confirm his assertions that he had not entered the house until well after his two co-offenders, and had not himself participated in the assault upon the deceased. It could be assumed that Mr. Kennedy would expect the applicant to give evidence of this nature because Mr. Kennedy had told others (such as a psychologist) that he had not gone into the deceased’s house until some time after his co-offenders and, once inside, had not participated in any way in the attack upon the deceased.
	
	
	Any reasonable consideration of the impugned passage, in the context of the whole of the judgment, could not conclude that what was stated there referred to a conspiracy between Mr. Kennedy and the applicant. That being the case, the relevant paragraph cannot establish actual bias, and nor is it such as to cause the fair-minded lay observer to reasonably apprehend bias on my part.
	
	
	Whilst the applicant relied upon purported differences between the account in Kennedy of his conduct as a witness, and those given by witnesses, how this was relevant to bias, actual or apprehended, was not articulated, and is not further considered.
	


Conclusion


	
	Having considered the evidence adduced by the applicant in support of his application, together with the submissions of counsel in seeking to advance it, I am not persuaded that the applicant has established either actual bias or apprehended bias.
	
	
	Bearing in mind the nature of these proceedings, being proceedings for contempt in the face of the court, where the Court observed the applicant’s conduct and brought the charges against him, it is necessary to guard against the possibility that an application of this nature could be brought by a contemnor in a cynical endeavour to avoid being dealt with by the judge who saw and heard the full extent of the contumacious conduct. Contemnors should not be encouraged in a belief that it is possible to influence the identity of the judicial officer who will finalise the proceedings, in the hope of obtaining a judge more likely to be favourable to the applicant. Such an outcome is inimical to the interests of justice.
	


ORDERS


	
	The application is refused.
	
	
	The matter is adjourned to 17 July 2015.

	Ms James pleaded guilty to each of the offences on the indictment and a Form 1 in Central Local Court on 31 March 2015 and is entitled to a discount to reflect the utilitarian value of those pleas. She is also entitled to a discount upon her sentence with respect to her undertaking to assist authorities in the prosecution of her co-accused Kodi Maybir. Mr Maybir has been charged with the murder of the deceased and his trial is scheduled to commence in this Court on 6 October 2015. These matters are referred to later in these remarks.
	
	
	At the time of his death the deceased was aged 7 years and 11 months.
	


Background


	
	Ms James was born in March 1988 and is now 27 years of age. The deceased was born in June 2005 and was Ms James’ first child. She has three other children, AB born in December 2007, CB born in April 2009 and KRJ born in March 2014. LAB is the father of Ms James’ first three children. AB and CB now live with him in New Zealand. Ms James’ co-accused is the father of KJR, who was born following her arrest. That child now lives with Ms James’ mother and step-father.
	
	
	For the purposes of the sentencing proceedings, agreed facts were tendered. To the extent that they are critical to my determinations, those facts are as follows.
	
	
	Ms James became involved in a relationship with Kodi Maybir on 18 January 2013. From the commencement of that relationship the deceased became the victim of ongoing neglect, physical and emotional abuse. This was primarily instigated and perpetrated by Mr Maybir but on occasion also by Ms James. This abuse continued until the death of the deceased on 21 May 2013. The cause of his death was initially described by Ms James and Mr Maybir as a head injury caused by a fall from a pogo stick at about 6.30 am on 20 May 2013. Neither Ms James nor Mr Maybir sought medical attention for the deceased even though, by their own accounts, he had been unconscious and non-responsive from the time he sustained the head injury. Ms James awoke the following day and found the deceased dead at approximately 6.10 am. She then called an ambulance.
	
	
	The deceased was found at autopsy to have sustained a large series of injuries suggestive of abuse. In addition, he was found to have sustained recent head injuries, including a fractured skull, an associated subdural haemorrhage, a fracture of the left temporal bone, significant bilateral temporal bruising and a bruise on the bridge of the nose. The injuries were inconsistent with a single fall from a pogo stick.
	
	
	The deceased was found at premises in Mulga Road, Oatley, at which was located a small suburban commercial unit leased to Mr Maybir as a music studio which he operated under the names Seminal Studios and Seventy Seven Records. Mr Maybir was a producer of what was described as Christian hip hop music and he performed under the name of “Kopri”. Several other businesses operated from commercial units at the same address.
	
	
	Prior to the commencement of her relationship with Mr Maybir, Ms James and her children had stayed with various members of her family since the breakdown of her relationship with LAB some years earlier. She had permanent custody of the children. Most recently Ms James had been living with her brother and sister-in-law at The Ponds. The children had been well cared for by her before she commenced her relationship with Mr Maybir in January 2013. Ms James regularly took her children to medical practitioners as the need arose.
	
	
	The deceased had been enrolled in grade 2 at Riverstone Public School on 25 June 2012 and was placed in a special education class. He was assessed as having a moderate intellectual disability, finding it difficult to master basic literacy and numeracy skills. He was performing at the level of a five year old. He was described by his teacher as a very quiet, timid, gentle and softly spoken boy with a docile nature who had made several friendships as he settled into school. He had not been involved in any incidents of bullying, was independently able to visit the toilet and he maintained good personal hygiene. His attendance was good, being absent for only four days in six months.
	
	
	On 18 January 2013 Ms James was introduced to Mr Maybir through mutual friends. Their friendship quickly became a relationship and Ms James commenced to adopt some of his extreme religious views. This included Mr Maybir’s parenting philosophies. In a recorded interview with police on 4 September 2014 Ms James said that the three children were assaulted throughout the period from January until the death of the deceased and that he received extra punishment as Mr Maybir said that he was the eldest and did not have a disability. Mr Maybir described the deceased as having only behavioural problems. Mr Maybir told Ms James that his assaults upon the deceased were to toughen him up and to give him confidence. This subsequently changed to punishment to the point where the children were getting punished “for anything and everything”.
	
	
	Mr Maybir formed the unsupported opinion that all of the children had been abused by Ms James’ father. He told her of his concerns and suggested that they stay at the studio to escape her family. Ms James told the police that Mr Maybir had previous experience working with troubled youth and he helped her to recognise that there was something different about her children. This issue of sexual abuse remained a constant theme throughout the following months as Mr Maybir and his beliefs began heavily to influence Ms James.
	
	
	Accordingly, on 24 January 2013 Ms James and her three children moved from her brother’s house into the studio at Oatley. It consisted of two main rooms without windows, a kitchenette and an entrance hall. There were no toilets or bathroom facilities. Toilets were located elsewhere in the building and were shared with other occupants. Recording artists were sometimes present and cannabis use was prevalent.
	
	
	The proper care of the children diminished greatly. The deceased attended school only twelve days from then until his death. He did not attend at all after 14 February that year. The extended family was denied access to the children and Ms James refused to tell them where she was living. This was in contrast to the close family ties before then.
	


Counts 1, 2 and 3


	
	On the afternoon of 20 February 2013 the deceased was travelling on a train between Town Hall and Oatley with Ms James. The deceased was required to recite his alphabet, with which he was having difficulty. He was slapped by Ms James several times during the train journey to Oatley on his arm very hard in an aggressive manner. Ms James also slapped her daughter AB when she attempted to help her brother remember his alphabet.
	


Count 4


	
	The incident that gives rise to this charge is recorded on video by Mr Maybir. The deceased was continually punched by his siblings on his chest and face as he stood alone in the middle of a room. He was also punched by Mr Maybir as he moved around the deceased like a boxer, hitting him softly in the stomach and on his back. Ms James was present when this occurred and actively encouraged this behaviour. The deceased was struck a total of 27 times throughout the duration of the recording that lasted three minutes and 35 seconds.
	


Count 5


	
	The incident that gives rise to this charge is recorded on video by Ms James. The deceased was forced to take part in a strenuous and exhausting wrestle with Mr Maybir, during the course of which he was punched on his chest and right biceps, placed in a bear hug, elbowed and thrown onto his back. The deceased became exhausted, out of breath and was wheezing heavily after about 40 seconds into the recording.
	


Count 6


	
	On 29 March 2013, Ms James and her children and Mr Maybir travelled by train to the Bulli Beach Tourist Park. They stayed at the campsite. During their stay there Ms James struck the deceased on his torso, buttocks and upper legs with a spatula over an extended period of about 15 minutes.
	


Count 7


	
	While still at the Bulli Beach Tourist Park, the children went running on the beach. The deceased became tired and it started to rain. As they were all running back to their tent Ms James had to carry the deceased who was falling behind. As she did so Ms James dropped her phone. She became upset and angry and struck the deceased several times across his buttocks with a wooden plank. The plank was a slat of the type used as a mattress support on a bed. The deceased was struck three times with the plank while he was standing. He was struck another eight times while Mr Maybir held his arms and pinned him down on a bed. The deceased was screaming and crying while this was taking place.
	
	
	As a result of these blows, the deceased sustained a series of linear wounds across his buttocks that began to blister and became infected. Ms James did not take him to a doctor for medical attention for his injuries.
	


Count 8


	
	On 20 April 2013, two videos were recorded inside the Bulli Beach Tourist Park cabin by Ms James. The footage runs for three minutes and depicts a form of discipline in which the deceased was required in a repetitive sequence to take off his jacket, put it on a chair, put it back on and so on in a continuous cycle. The process is redolent of a method apparently used for teaching mental discipline to adults in the context of martial arts training. In this case it was used by Ms James as punishment.
	


Count 9


	
	On 19 May 2013 Ms James recorded a video depicting the deceased running on the spot for an extended period of one minute and seventeen seconds. He became breathless and distressed and sounded fearful when spoken to by Ms James.
	


Count 10


	
	Between 24 January 2013 and the date of his death in May that year the appearance of the deceased altered significantly as a result of a number of factors including lack of food and drink, poor hygiene, sub-standard living conditions and multiple punishments and assaults. He was placed in social isolation and his food and water intake was restricted. This was described somewhat tragically as an eating plan in which he was provided with only a bare minimum of sustenance. He was excluded from special treats like chocolate and biscuits and from enjoyable times with the rest of the family. The deceased became gaunt and dehydrated. Ms James imposed this regime upon him as a form of punishment for a regression in his toileting abilities.
	


Count 11


	
	At 6.12 am on 21 May 2013 Ms James called an ambulance and told the telephone operator that the deceased had been playing on a pogo stick the previous morning and had fallen over. She said that he “banged his head pretty hard” and that he had been sleeping and not moving since then. When the ambulance arrived it was apparent that the deceased had died. He showed signs of lividity and rigor mortis, indicating that he had been dead for some time. He had extensive bruising on his limbs and a boggy mass at the rear of his head with coning indicative of trauma.
	
	
	When first interviewed Ms James continued to maintain that the deceased had fallen from a pogo stick. She said that she was in the kitchen when she heard a thud and a scratch. She ran into the room and saw the deceased lying on the floor near the pogo stick. She grabbed him but could see his eyes rolling back. She dabbed water on his face but he did not wake up. She placed him on the kitchen floor and his eyes were still rolling. He was frothing at the mouth. Ms James carried the deceased from the kitchen to the recreational area in the studio and placed him on a leather lounge. He was barely conscious. She tried unsuccessfully to give him Panadol.
	
	
	The deceased’s condition did not change for the rest of the morning and into the afternoon. She changed his clothing. He occasionally opened his eyes and moaned. Ms James told police that she “had a feeling something was wrong”. She was worried. The deceased remained unresponsive and could not be woken. After lunch she thought that the deceased looked uncomfortable so she placed him in a bed. Mr Maybir asked her if they should call an ambulance and she said, “I don’t know”. Ms James said that she was confused because this was more or less the first time that Mr Maybir had given her responsibility for decisions about herself or the children.
	
	
	The deceased was still breathing at midnight. The following morning Ms James went to check on the deceased but he was by then cold and motionless. She saw that something was wrong and told Mr Maybir that they had to call an ambulance. She was told by Mr Maybir to tell the ambulance officers that the deceased had fallen from a pogo stick. Ms James told police that she did not call an ambulance earlier because she was prevented by Mr Maybir from doing so. Ms James acknowledged that she was aware that there was a medical centre located below the studio that was open between 7.00 am and 1.00 pm.
	


Form 1


	
	Ms James was charged with two offences on a Form 1 of neglecting AB and CB by failing to provide adequate lodging contrary to the terms of s 228 of the Children and Young Persons (Care and Protection) Act 1998. I have taken these offences into account in the disposition of count 10.
	


Objective seriousness


	
	Ms James pleaded guilty to count 11 on the basis of gross criminal negligence, having caused the death of the deceased by an omission in circumstances where she owed him a personal duty of care, yet failed to carry out that duty to such a high degree that it can be properly characterised as wicked and deserving of punishment: R v Taktak (1998) 14 NSWLR 226; Burns v The Queen [2012] HCA 35; (2012) 246 CLR 334 at [97]. By pleading guilty, Ms James acknowledges that her conduct involved such a falling short of the standard of care that a reasonable person would have exercised and involved such a high risk of death or grievous bodily harm that the doing of the act or the failure to act merited criminal punishment: Burns at [19]. Ms James’ relevant omission was her continued failure to respond to the deceased, who was in a situation of risk of serious harm, or to the medical crisis that he faced: R v Wilkinson [1999] NSWCCA 248 at [13]. This is different to reckless indifference to human life and Ms James is not to be sentenced upon the basis that her inaction warranted or fell within that description: R v Johnston [2007] SASC 300 at [66].
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the offence charged as count 11 must be regarded as an offence of the most serious kind. That is because of the advanced age of the deceased who was incapacitated, in circumstances where Ms James knew that he had been the victim of continual violence and cruelty for a period of almost four months before his death, and where the deceased was vulnerable by reason of his intellectual disability: s 21A(2)(l) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. Moreover, the deceased was Ms James’ child and she was in a position of trust which was breached: s 21A(2)(k); see also R v HA [2008] NSWSC 1368 at [42]. A heavy responsibility rests upon a parent to care for a child who is otherwise utterly defenceless: R v Wilkinson at [26]. I observe, however, that the relationship of trust and its breach is inherent in the offence charged as count 11 and it is not appropriate to take account of this factor more than once. There was an extended period of almost 24 hours between the infliction of the deceased’s ultimately fatal injuries and the securing of medical attention for his care. Ms James also initially embarked upon a course designed to deceive the police about her conduct in failing to care for the deceased in the circumstances.
	
	
	The Crown also characterised the other offences as serious examples of offences of their kind. The deceased had been the victim of constant abuse, had been physically assaulted whilst defenceless and was intellectually disabled.
	
	
	Ms James, by her counsel, did not dispute the Crown’s characterisation of the objective seriousness of the offences. Except for counts 1, 2 and 3, they were all committed in the company of Mr Maybir: s 21A(2)(e). The fact of being “in company” is an element of count 7 and cannot therefore be taken into account in the assessment of the seriousness of that offence. All of the offences were committed in the presence of another child: s 21A(2)(ea). All of the offences (with the exception of counts 1, 2 and 3) were committed in the home of the victim: s 21A(2)(eb). However, the home was also the home of Ms James and care must be taken in attaching undue weight to this factor in the circumstances: see Montero v R [2013] NSWCCA 214 per R A Hulme J at [41] – [55]. The injury and emotional harm caused by the offences was substantial: s 21A(2)(g).
	
	
	The violence used by Ms James is comprehended by all of the offences for which she stands to be sentenced. Sections 21A(2)(b) and 21A(2)(c) do not therefore apply. Section 21A(2)(k) also does not apply in respect of counts 4, 5, 8 and 9 (in addition to count 11), or to the two offences on the Form 1, as the abuse of trust is inherent in those offences as well.
	
	
	In my opinion count 11 is an example of a most serious category of offences of its kind. It transcended simple mistake, mere negligence or a transient error of judgment. The evidence makes it clear that the deceased was profoundly ill and in dire need of critical medical care from the moment that he sustained his injuries. There is no room for doubt that the only proper course at the time was the immediate and urgent summoning of medical or paramedical care. Not only did that not occur, but the deceased was left relevantly unattended for 24 hours during which Ms James and Mr Maybir apparently went about their usual and personal activities as if nothing had happened. To the extent that the situation was distressing and painful for Ms James, which I accept on any available understanding or appreciation of humanity must have been the case, it inexplicably did not translate into the speedy provision of potentially lifesaving assistance to this moribund child. I accept in these circumstances that Ms James’ failure to act in a proper way to attend to her son was profound, cruel and selfish.
	
	
	It is not possible, however, to characterise the balance of the offences for which Ms James is to be sentenced as all falling into that category or even the same category. Of the other offences, counts 7 and 4 are in my opinion the most serious. Count 7 involved the beating of the deceased with a timber bed strut, with the associated production of open wounds. This offence is a most serious example of offences of its kind. Count 4 involved the recording of what was a sickening series of assaults upon a silently compliant little boy by his brother and sister in circumstances that must have been confusing and distressing, particularly when his mother was present but did not intervene to protect him. No less confusing for the deceased would have been the regime to which he was subjected in the events that constitute count 8.
	
	
	Care has to be taken with the proper characterisation of the events that constitute the recording that is count 5. I observe that it is very easy to view the rough and tumble of this event as a sinister extension of other cruel behaviour. However, taken in isolation and removed from a possibly unsavoury context, the deceased and Mr Maybir were engaged in conduct that, for better or worse, could pass objectively as acceptable, albeit rough, play activity within the framework of ordinary households. I am not prepared to proceed upon the basis that the extraordinary nature of the deceased’s household necessarily converts what is depicted in the video into child abuse properly understood. The deceased’s observable inclination to continue to wrestle with Mr Maybir is in my view inconsistent with a child of little resolve or limited capacity unable for those reasons to resist adult pressure to comply despite exhaustion or the infliction of pain.
	
	
	Counts 1, 2 and 3 are examples of no more and no less than behaviour that occurs in Australian society on a regular and reoccurring basis every day of the week. To say so is neither to endorse its use nor to assign to it some undeserved respectability. It is once again important in an attempt to understand Ms James’ administration of parental discipline not to characterise the conduct as more than an example of wholly misguided behaviour. It is to be denounced as unacceptable and, in the circumstances as they occurred, unnecessary and terribly unfair. However, and regrettably in the scheme of prevalent parental behaviour, these offences fall below the middle of the range of objective seriousness for offences of this type in my opinion.
	
	
	The same cannot also be said of the events that constitute count 6. These assaults continued over an extended period and involved the use of an implement. This count is in my opinion slightly above the middle of the range of objective seriousness for offences of its type.
	
	
	Count 8 is an example of the recording of what amounted to psychological abuse of the deceased. The video does not reveal that he was in physical pain or discomfort. It does in my opinion portray a little boy whose will to do other than comply with his instructions has been entirely overborne. The recorded material is, however, in the scheme of child abuse material offending the nominated provision of the Crimes Act, at the lowest end of the range of objective seriousness.
	
	
	By way of minor contrast, I consider that the events recorded and forming the basis of count 9 are slightly more serious. This is because of the apparent physical distress occasioned to the deceased by requiring him to continue to run on the spot when both his capacity and willingness to do so have obviously become or are rapidly becoming exhausted.
	
	
	Count 10 is in this case constituted by acts and omissions that in my view make it a serious offence. There does not appear to be any rational or comprehensible basis for withdrawing food or water from a seven year old child. The evidence suggests that on occasion the deceased was considerably and seriously dehydrated and hungry. It strains one’s belief in basic humanity that anyone would even contemplate, let alone permit, the infliction of such depredations upon a child, ostensibly as acceptable discipline.
	


Subjective circumstances


	
	Ms James was born in New Zealand in March 1988 and came to Australia as a young child. She has three siblings. Her parents’ relationship was characterised by alcohol abuse and domestic violence on the part of her father which she witnessed. Ms James was herself the physical and emotional victim from time to time of her father’s drunken temper. Her mother sometimes took the family to refuges to escape the violence in the home. Ms James’ parents separated when she was aged about 11 years and each has entered into a new relationship. She lived between her parents after their separation.
	
	
	Ms James was subjected to a number of indecent sexual assaults as a child at the hands of extended family members. She did not seek counselling with respect to these incidents until she was 24 years of age. Ms James now tends to downplay the significance of these assaults.
	
	
	Ms James was also sexually propositioned by her stepfather after the birth of her third child. She was at that time separated from LAB and residing in her stepfather’s home. This incident would appear to have caused her to lose any sense that her mother’s home was a safe place for her to live with her children.
	
	
	Ms James was also the victim of violence at the hands of LAB. This started when she was a few months pregnant with the deceased, when she was herself either 16 or 17 years old. This violence continued for five years until her relationship with him came to an end. She was then 21 years of age. LAB returned to New Zealand shortly thereafter. He neither maintained contact with his children nor provided Ms James with any form of financial assistance or support.
	
	
	Ms James was also a victim of violence at the hands of Mr Maybir. She reported to her psychiatrist and gave evidence before me that this involved him placing his hands around her throat, screaming at her, shaking her and spitting at her. Mr Maybir has a history of domestic violence against his former wife.
	
	
	Professor Hayes examined Ms James and identified a level of intellectual functioning in the low average range of intelligence. She has an IQ placing her in the bottom 21 percent of the population. Both Professor Hayes and Dr Furst diagnosed her with a dependent personality disorder. When she met Mr Maybir, Ms James did not attend church and did not appear to hold any religious beliefs. She was studying to become a beauty technician. However, less than a week after entering a relationship with Mr Maybir she moved with her children into Mr Maybir’s so-called Christian rap music studio in Oatley. Shortly after that, Ms James began to espouse devout religious beliefs to her family, and often quoted biblical text to them.
	
	
	Mr Maybir had had a close association with evangelical churches throughout his life and participated in children’s camps run by Prisons Fellowships Australia, a Christian based organisation promoting religious fellowship with prisoners and their families. He introduced the idea of what are called boot camp techniques into that organisation.
	
	
	Both Professor Hayes and Dr Furst accepted that Ms James very quickly fell under the influence of Mr Maybir to the point that she effectively subjugated herself, and delegated her parental responsibilities for her children, particularly the deceased, to him. The several reasons why it appears that Ms James did so include the following:
	



	
	Her pre-existing dependent personality disorder.
	
	
	The physical, emotional, relationship and sexual dysfunction that she had experienced since early childhood.
	
	
	Her low average intelligence.
	
	
	Mr Maybir’s self-aggrandising and self-promotional behaviour, claiming falsely to be a successful rap musician with a big future.
	
	
	Mr Maybir frequently quoted biblical passages that gave him an air of authority.
	
	
	Ms James’ relative social isolation prior to meeting Mr Maybir.
	
	
	Mr Maybir’s exercise of control over all important aspects of Ms James’ life, including but not limited to insisting that she not maintain contact with any person who did not hold his religious beliefs as well as isolating her from her family.
	
	
	Mr Maybir’s actions that caused Ms James to question or doubt her own parenting abilities. Her children would appear in all relevant respects to have been properly and adequately cared for by her before meeting Mr Maybir with the assistance of her extended family. They attended school, were given professional medical care when required, and were properly fed and clothed. The deceased’s intellectual disability had been the subject of discussion with his teachers and his problems were recognised and were being appropriately addressed. That all changed significantly and for the worse under Mr Maybir’s influence. He told her that the children needed to be toughened up mentally. He convinced Ms James that he was the only person who could help her.
	
	
	Mr Maybir convinced Ms James that the deceased did not have an intellectual disability but that he was only in need of correct discipline.
	
	
	Mr Maybir persuaded Ms James that her children had been sexually assaulted by her father and manipulated her with that lie so that she became distant from her previously supportive extended family.
	



	
	Professor Hayes likened the position in which Ms James found herself, under the influence and control of Mr Maybir, to what is referred to as Stockholm Syndrome in which a captive develops a bond with his or her captor. Professor Hayes also likened Ms James’ position to members of a cult who become susceptible to loss of independence, unassertive, gullible, possessing a desire for spiritual meaning, all in ignorance of the mechanisms of ongoing manipulation.
	


Mitigating factors


	
	Ms James has no previous convictions of any kind. She is a person of good character. I accept that she is unlikely to reoffend, particularly if she is able to address her underlying personality pathology. Ms James has correspondingly good prospects of rehabilitation by reason of her young age and developing maturity, her willingness to engage in counselling and therapy since being incarcerated, the ongoing support of her family and the genuine grief and remorse that she feels and has expressed at the death of the deceased and the loss of her other three children.
	


Plea of guilty


	
	Ms James pleaded guilty to all of the offences at what amounts to the earliest opportunity to do so following negotiations with the DPP. She is in these circumstances in my opinion entitled to a generous discount upon her sentence for the utilitarian value of her pleas. That value is significant in this case if only for the avoidance of the need to call a large number of witnesses to give evidence about particularly distressing matters.
	


Assistance to authorities


	
	Ms James was originally charged with murder on 21 November 2013, together with a series of other offences. The Director initially declined on 27 May 2014 to accept her offer to make an induced statement. The Director maintained that position on 10 July 2014, and declined to accept Ms James’ offer to plead guilty to manslaughter. The Director indicated that he was prepared to consider the matter further if Ms James were able to provide a further electronically recorded interview, in order that he could better assess her level of culpability. The Director ultimately accepted her offer to plead guilty to manslaughter, upon the basis of gross criminal negligence, on 4 March 2015. Ms James entered her pleas of guilty to all charges on 31 March 2015.
	
	
	Ms James has offered to assist authorities and to give evidence against Mr Maybir. I have been provided with a summary of that evidence and with a formal undertaking to assist the prosecution at the trial of Mr Maybir. Without descending into the detail of what it is anticipated that Ms James could say, it is apparent that her evidence is likely to be of considerable assistance and of great value in the Crown case against her co-accused. Prior to her offer of assistance, the case against Mr Maybir was circumstantial by reason of the fact that his assaults upon the deceased were not witnessed by any adult, apart from Ms James. It is anticipated that Ms James’ evidence of what she saw and heard will render the balance of the circumstantial case against Mr Maybir more convincing.
	
	
	I observe as well that even though Ms James was not a witness to the infliction of the lethal assault upon the deceased, she was present when Mr Maybir carried him into the kitchen in an unresponsive state. Ms James will give evidence that she did not inflict the ultimately fatal injuries upon the deceased.
	


Special circumstances


	
	Before any variation of the statutory ratio of the non-parole to parole periods of any sentence is made, it is necessary that the circumstances are sufficiently special to justify any such variation: R v Fidow [2004] NSWCCA 172 at [22]. The Crown submitted that the necessarily lengthy period of parole in this case would be sufficient for any purpose that such a period is intended to achieve.
	
	
	Ms James submitted that a finding of special circumstances could be made. First, there are multiple offences and so some degree of accumulation is inevitable. Secondly, Ms James is young and she is likely to be considerably more mature upon her eventual release from custody. Thirdly, Ms James has very good prospects of rehabilitation: she is amenable to counselling which is more readily available in the community and she should be monitored and managed while re-establishing herself as a member of society.
	


Voluntary admission of previously unknown offence


	
	Ms James volunteered the fact that she had beaten the deceased with a wooden plank while he was held down by Mr Maybir. I have already indicated that this was a serious example of an offence of its kind. Ms James submitted, however, that her admission of this offence attracted a degree of leniency in accordance with the well-known remarks of Street CJ in R v Ellis (1986) 6 NSWLR 603 at 604. Even though the fact that someone had assaulted the deceased in this way was obvious to police by reason of the scars on his body, the allocation of responsibility for the actual infliction of the wounds was not as easily determined. Ms James took responsibility for this offence in circumstances where her liability might not have been similarly detected.
	
	
	The application of the Ellis principle does not require the quantification or assessment of a specific discount. I consider that Ms James is entitled to a degree of leniency in the determination of a proper sentence in respect of this particular offence.
	


Victim impact statements


	
	The common law requires that I have regard to the effect of crime upon a victim: Porter v R [2008] NSWCCA 145 at [54]. Section 3A(g) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act provides that one of the purposes for which a court may impose a sentence on an offender is “to recognise the harm done to the victim of the crime and the community”. The Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Amendment (Family Member Victim Impact Statement) Act 2014 makes it clear that, in applying s 3A(g), a victim impact statement given by a victim may, on the application of the prosecutor and if the court considers it appropriate to do so, be considered and taken into account on the basis that the harmful impact of the primary victim’s death on the members of his or her immediate family is an aspect of harm done to the community.
	
	
	Section 28 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act provides as follows:
	


“28 When victim impact statements may be received and considered

(1) If it considers it appropriate to do so, a court may receive and consider a victim impact statement at any time after it convicts, but before it sentences, an offender.

(2) A victim impact statement may also be received and considered by the Supreme Court when it determines an application under Schedule 1 for the determination of a term and a non-parole period for an existing life sentence referred to in that Schedule.

(3) If the primary victim has died as a direct result of the offence, a court must receive a victim impact statement given by a family victim and acknowledge its receipt, and may make any comment on it that the court considers appropriate.

(4) A victim impact statement given by a family victim may, on the application of the prosecutor and if the court considers it appropriate to do so, be considered and taken into account by a court in connection with the determination of the punishment for the offence on the basis that the harmful impact of the primary victim’s death on the members of the primary victim’s immediate family is an aspect of harm done to the community.

(4A) Subsection (4) does not affect the application of the law of evidence in proceedings relating to sentencing.

(5) A court may make a victim impact statement available to the prosecutor, to the offender or to any other person on such conditions (which must include conditions preventing the offender from retaining copies of the statement) as it considers appropriate.

(6) Despite any other provision of this section, a court must not consider or take into account a victim impact statement under this section unless it has been given by or on behalf of the victim to whom it relates or by or on behalf of the prosecutor.”


	
	I take into account that the attitude of the victim’s family towards the offender is not relevant to the proper exercise of my sentencing discretion: R v Paul (2002) 134 A Crim R 174 at [37]; R v Dawes [2004] NSWCCA 363. I have had regard to those victim impact statements to the extent and in the way that I am entitled to do in accordance with authority and the relevant statutory provisions. I accept that the death of the deceased has had a significant effect upon them and upon all those who knew the deceased for the short period of his life.
	
	
	In this case, victim impact statements were read aloud in court on the occasion of the sentencing proceedings by two of the deceased’s grandparents. It is understandable that the death of a young child evokes strong emotions and incites the making of powerful and brutally honest statements. I feel the need in this case to comment, however, that a victim impact statement should not be used as the occasion to refer to the offender or any co-accused in offensive or pejorative terms in the way that was adopted in one of the victim impact statements read aloud before me. The maintenance of dignity in the face of grief says more to me about a victim and his or her suffering than a gratuitous explosion of distasteful remarks and venomous adjectives.
	


The proper sentence


	
	It is sadly apparent that the deceased must have suffered considerably in the last months of his life. That suffering was not limited to the consequences of physical abuse, but extended also to the emotional turmoil and undoubted confusion under which he must have laboured as he endured a series of awful indignities at the hands of or in the presence of his mother who failed in her maternal duty to protect him. All of this is compounded in my view by the fact that when the deceased was injured and dying, Ms James failed even then to take the simplest steps to optimise or preserve his small but rapidly diminishing chances of survival.
	
	
	I accept however that when confronted with this awful circumstance, Ms James was herself the victim of a series of occult influences that compromised her ability to respond normally. The evidence adequately suggests that Ms James was unduly and powerfully compromised by the physical and psychological presence of Mr Maybir. These remarks are for important and obvious reasons not the place to evaluate his apparent role in the events that occurred. It is, however, appropriate and permissible to observe that Ms James would in my view have acted differently had it not been for the insidious influence that Mr Maybir was able to exert upon her.
	
	
	That influence is not a complete answer to my sentencing task. That is because it seems to me to be apparent that Ms James, when confronted with a competition between the needs of her dying son on the one hand and her concern about what might be Mr Maybir’s attitude or reaction should she have exposed him to the possibility of criminal sanctions on the other hand, she decided to prefer the needs of Mr Maybir rather than those of her son. An inspection of that analysis reveals that in apparently preferring the interests of Mr Maybir, Ms James simultaneously preferred her own interests to those of the deceased. Whereas this case appears to be explicable when Mr Maybir’s influence is appreciated and applied, it becomes inexplicable when his influence diminishes. In the period when the deceased lay unconscious and dying, and when Mr Maybir was himself absent from the house, it is difficult to understand why the imperatives of maternal instinct and the incipient loss of her son did not combine to eradicate or calm Ms James’ fears or prompt her immediately to summon emergency assistance.
	
	
	This tragic and fateful circumstance is reflected in a passage of transcript of the evidence given by Ms James before me as follows:
	


“MAXWELL QC: If you just look at paragraphs 186 to 187 and just read them to yourself, I just want to ask you something. So is it the case that Mr Maybir went out at around 6pm on the 20th and was away for over three hours?

A. Yes.

Q. Now at that time you could have sought help for [the deceased], correct?

A. Yes, I could have.

HIS HONOUR

Q. Why didn't you?

A. I was worried. I was worried for Kodi's safety rather than the welfare of [the deceased].

Q. But if he had fallen off a pogo stick there wouldn't have been a problem, would there?

A. (No verbal response).”


	
	I consider that Ms James is entitled to a discount of 40 percent on her sentence for the combined effect of her pleas of guilty and her past and future assistance to authorities. I am mindful that a discount ought not to produce a result that becomes on that account unreasonably disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of the offending. I have also taken account of the remarks of Howie J in R v Sukkar [2006] NSWCCA 92 at [5]. I consider that Ms James is entitled to a 25 percent discount for her early pleas and that the balance of the 40 percent ought to be referable to her past and continuing assistance and her associated undertaking.
	
	
	I am entirely satisfied that Ms James is remorseful. She gave evidence before me in the course of which it was evident in the clearest terms that she both regretted what she had done, and what she had failed to do, and that she would be burdened with the consequences and the associated guilt for the rest of her life.
	
	
	I have no sense that special deterrence has any significant role to play in the formulation of a proper sentence in this case. The reasons for that will be obvious and I take it to be unnecessary to explain my view in any detail.
	
	
	The question of general deterrence is more difficult. At one level of inquiry it seems absurd that there could ever be a need to discourage mothers, or parents more broadly, from killing their young children. Upon closer examination, however, the issue of importance in this particular case is more acutely concerned with deterring inaction or procrastination when action is called for, especially when timidity or fear may be lurking. That is particularly so because children have no appreciation of the extent of their vulnerability and every reason to anticipate that they can rely upon their parents to shield them from harm at all times. I am not confident that sentences often if ever send messages to would-be criminals that are actually received and meaningfully processed, inasmuch as the rationality of that process is usually and inevitably defeated by the irrationality of the acts or omissions causing death. However, I am completely satisfied that courts have a role to speak in the interests of the community and to denounce crimes such as these in clear terms.
	
	
	In R v Foster (No 2) [2001] SASC 154 at [5], Gray J said this:
	


“General deterrence is of particular importance in a case such as this. Persons entrusted with the care of innocent young children must be deterred from abusing their positions of trust and power. The court must extend the full protection of the law to vulnerable children and to the community by imposing sentences which will deter others. Adults must clearly understand that abuses of trust and power which lead to death will result in severe sentences of imprisonment.”


	
	I accept unequivocally that it is important to sentence in a way that recognises “a need for parents to understand the serious consequences of breaching the trust reposed in them to care for their infant children”: Sam v R; R v Sam [2011] NSWCCA 36 at [151]. The sentence that I impose should also make it clear to Ms James that she has breached the most fundamental trust between human beings.
	
	
	I am not convinced that any significant restructuring of the parole to non-parole period ratio is called for in this case. Having said as much, I accept that it is distinctly possible that Ms James’ precise needs for psychiatric or psychological care and attention have neither fully materialized nor been accurately identified and care should be exercised when recommitting her to a less supervised life when she is finally released.
	
	
	I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that Ms James will never reoffend and that her prospects of rehabilitation are correspondingly and by definition beyond doubt.
	
	
	I have already determined that the death of the deceased places the relevant offence in the most serious category of offences of its type. I am also mindful of the principle of sentencing that requires me to sentence Ms James in a way that ensures that the aggregation of the sentences for her numerous offences is a just and appropriate measure of the total criminality involved.
	


Aggregate sentences and s 10A


	
	Section 53A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act provides as follows:
	


“53A Aggregate sentences of imprisonment

(1) A court may, in sentencing an offender for more than one offence, impose an aggregate sentence of imprisonment with respect to all or any 2 or more of those offences instead of imposing a separate sentence of imprisonment for each.

(2) A court that imposes an aggregate sentence of imprisonment under this section on an offender must indicate to the offender, and make a written record of, the following:

(a) the fact that an aggregate sentence is being imposed,

(b) the sentence that would have been imposed for each offence (after taking into account such matters as are relevant under Part 3 or any other provision of this Act) had separate sentences been imposed instead of an aggregate sentence.

(3) Subsection (2) does not limit any requirement that a court has, apart from that subsection, to record the reasons for its decisions.

(4) The term, and any non-parole period, set under this Division in relation to an aggregate sentence of imprisonment is not revoked or varied by a later sentence of imprisonment that the same or some other court subsequently imposes in relation to another offence.

(5) An aggregate sentence of imprisonment is not invalidated by a failure to comply with this section.”


	
	The practical problems associated with a traditional approach to sentencing in this case, having regard to the conclusions I have reached concerning the comparative criminality of the various counts, impels me to the conclusion that the provisions of s 53A should be embraced and applied. I recognise that there is a need, in a meaningful way, to acknowledge and underscore the criminality evident in the serious offences committed by Ms James. It is however important to do so, as far as possible, without unnecessarily derogating from the significance of the sentencing process by the imposition of a series of wholly concurrent sentences whose criminality is thereby not practically acknowledged.
	
	
	I therefore propose in this case to impose an aggregate sentence. The indicative sentences of imprisonment for those counts that I consider warrant the imposition of a custodial penalty are respectively as follows:
	
	
	Count 4: imprisonment for a period of 9 months.
	
	
	Count 6: imprisonment for a period of 9 months.
	
	
	Count 7: imprisonment for 12 months with a non-parole period of 9 months.
	
	
	Count 9: imprisonment for a period of 9 months.
	
	
	Count 10: imprisonment for a period of 12 months.
	
	
	Count 11: imprisonment for a period of 12 years.
	
	
	In assessing these indicative sentences I have had specific and particular regard to the requirements of s 53A and to R A Hulme J’s informative and helpful remarks concerning the application of that provision in JM v R [2014] NSWCCA 297 at [39] – [40]. For the avoidance of doubt I note that in making these assessments I have specifically taken account, among other things, of relevant matters in Part 3 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act including all of the previously mentioned and considered aggravating, mitigating and other factors to which s 21A refers, as well as the 40 percent discount for the combined effect of Ms James’ pleas of guilty and her assistance to authorities, as well as the offences on the Form 1. By way of further explication, this means for count 11, by way of example, that I have chosen a starting point, before the application of the combined 40 percent discount, of imprisonment for 20 years.
	
	
	I observe in addition, as will already be apparent, that I do not intend to impose custodial sentences in respect of the offences in counts 1, 2, 3, 5 and 8. I should indicate why I have taken this course.
	
	
	Counts 1, 2 and 3 involve the application of corporal punishment. Such a form of discipline has thankfully, although not entirely, fallen into disuse. Standing alone, I consider that these offences would not, and in the context of the proceedings as a whole do not, warrant a term of imprisonment.
	
	
	Count 5 involved the recording of what I consider upon review to have been rough play. The activity barely qualifies, if it qualifies at all, as child abuse and its recording fails correspondingly to qualify as child abuse material. In different circumstances, uncoloured by the sinister background of abuse evident here, it could pass as an unexceptional home video, of which other benign and happy examples have been tendered in these proceedings. This count does not warrant or justify the imposition of a term of imprisonment.
	
	
	Count 8 depicts the deceased repeatedly taking his jacket off and putting it back on. It would appear to have been intended to operate as some form of psychological punishment or discipline. The deceased was not physically harmed by this process. He makes no complaint or protest about it. It seems to me to be analogous to sending a child to bed without dinner. Without intending either to express, or to appear to be expressing, any view about the appropriateness of the method concerned, I am troubled that the recorded conduct could ever be thought to warrant the imposition of a custodial sentence in Australia today.
	
	
	Section 10A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act is in the following terms:
	


“10A Conviction with no other penalty

(1) A court that convicts an offender may dispose of the proceedings without imposing any other penalty.

(2) Any such action is taken, for the purposes of the Crimes (Local Courts Appeal and Review) Act 2001 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, to be a sentence passed by the court on the conviction of the offender.”


	
	This provision permits a court that convicts an offender to dispose of the proceedings without imposing any other penalty. It is implicit in the terms of the section that a conviction standing alone is itself a penalty. There are clear and obvious reasons why that is so. In the particular circumstances of this case, the offences corresponding to the counts I am now considering would on one view have attracted little, or at least quite different, attention were it not for the events that ultimately and tragically occurred. It is reasonably apparent as well that they would in all probability have remained undetected. Interestingly, the train passengers who witnessed and described what they saw when the deceased was slapped on the arm by Ms James, being the offences covered by counts 1, 2 and 3, were not moved to report the matter to the police or any other apparently interested and responsible authority. That is not so much a poor reflection upon them as much as an indication of their practical, and what amounts to a contextual, view of the seriousness of the conduct.
	
	
	There is also little utility in imposing sentences that would pass without comment if imposed wholly concurrently with one or more of the sentences of imprisonment referable to the most serious counts on the indictment. There can be difficulties of appearance in imposing custodial sentences almost as a matter of form that are wholly concurrent with, and which are therefore subsumed in, sentences of imprisonment imposed for more serious crimes arising out of related events.
	
	
	In short I consider that all of these counts do not warrant and should not attract the imposition of a custodial sentence. There is in addition, having regard to the non-parole period that I intend to impose with respect to the other counts, no utility in doing so.
	


Orders


	
	I make the following orders:
	



	
	Kayla James, on counts 1 to 11 inclusive you are convicted.
	
	
	On counts 4, 6, 7, 9, 10 and 11, I sentence you to an aggregate sentence of 14 years imprisonment commencing on 20 November 2013 and expiring on 19 November 2027 with a non-parole period of 10 years and 6 months expiring on 19 May 2024.
	
	
	I order in respect of counts 1, 2, 3, 5 and 8 that the proceedings in respect of those counts be disposed of without the imposition of a further penalty.
	



	
	The earliest date upon which you will be eligible for release on parole is therefore 20 May 2024.

		26 February 2016",2015-06-24 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2703174,Cavric v Nationwide News Pty Ltd [2015] NSWDC 107,"Judgment


	
	These are my reasons for the orders I made following argument as to the form and capacity of the imputations pleaded as arising from two publications by the defendant, respectively entitled “Trolley Lady Loses $285k Compo Crash” and “Woman hit by a shopping trolley loses her bid for compensation as judge rules she exaggerated her injuries”. It was not possible for me to give reasons in an oral judgment due to my commitments to other proceedings before me for hearing on the same day.
	
	
	The matters complained of are a newspaper publication in the Sunday Telegraph dated 11 May 2014 (the first matter complained of) and a website publication on the Daily Telegraph website dated 10 May 2014 (the second matter complained of). They are in more or less identical form, although the website publication contains minor variations which repeat and highlight portions of the text, and a different headline. The text of each of the matters complained of is set out in a schedule at the end of this judgment.
	
	
	The imputations pleaded to arise from each of the publications (paragraphs 4 and 6 of the statement of claim) are as follows:
	



	
	The plaintiff was a malingerer (whole article).
	
	
	The plaintiff lost her bid for compensation because she exaggerated her injuries (whole article).
	
	
	The plaintiff’s District Court claim for $285,000 failed because she lied about her neck injury (whole article).
	
	
	The plaintiff attempted to deceive the District Court (whole article).
	
	
	The plaintiff knowingly brought a false Court case claiming $285,000 compensation (whole article).
	


The relevant principles


	
	The test to apply to challenges to the capacity of imputations is a generous one (Favell v Queensland Newspapers Pty Ltd (2005) 79 ALJR 1716 at [6]), particularly the matter complained of is a loosely worded or tabloid-style publication, as is clearly the case here (Amalgamated Television Services Pty Ltd v Marsden (1998) 43 NSWLR 158). Mr Rasmussen relies upon the restatement of these principles in Corby v Allen & Unwin Pty Ltd [2014] NSWCA 227 at [135]–[136], where the court held that the determination of capacity is an issue of generosity and not of parsimony, as well as being a “matter of impression … the impression is not of what the words mean but of what a jury could sensibly think they meant”.
	
	
	The test to apply to objections of form is set out in Drummoyne Municipal Council v Australian Broadcasting Corporation (1990) 21 NSWLR 135. Although Emmett JA referred to the need for precision in imputations in Fairfax Media Publications Pty Ltd v King [2015] NSWCA 172, his Honour nevertheless endorsed and applied Gleeson CJ’s explanation, in Drummoyne Municipal Council v Australian Broadcasting Corporation at 137, that an imputation capturing the sting of a general smear (such as “X is disgusting”) requires no further glossing (see also Younan v Nationwide News Pty Ltd [2013] NSWCA 335 at [20]). When considering challenges to form, the degree of precision required for the imputations pleaded must be seen in context of the matter complained of.
	
	
	Where a ruling is sought in relation to the capacity of the matter complained of is sought, an order for a separate trial of this issue is required: Nationwide News Pty Ltd v Hibbert [2015] NSWCA 13 at [20] – [21]. I note that this step has been complied with in paragraph 4.2 of the defendant’s solicitor’s letter of 3 June 2015.
	
	
	Having noted these principles, I now consider the objections raised in relation to each of the imputations.
	


Imputations 4(a) and 6(a)


	
	In challenging the capacity of this imputation, Mr Lewis relies upon the Australian Oxford Dictionary definition of “malingerer” as being a person who will “exaggerate or feign illness in order to escape duty, work, etc”. He submits the matters complained of do not convey an imputation that the plaintiff has exaggerated illness so as not to work; the matters complained of referred only to the plaintiff’s exaggeration of her claim for compensation against the Willoughby City Council.
	
	
	While it is arguable that the term “malingerer” is not restricted to exaggerating illness in order to escape work (this being the reason why the word “etc” appears in the dictionary definition), even this fairly narrow definition of “malingerer” can be met from the text of the matters complained of. Paragraph 9 states:
	


“The Liverpool Boys High School teacher claimed she was forced to quit her job as a result of the pain and hire a $200-a-week cleaner [to help with home duties].”


	
	Mr Rasmussen submits, and I agree, that a picture is painted of a teacher who is exaggerating her illness and using it as an excuse not to work. This is sufficient to satisfy the test for capacity to convey an imputation of malingering, and imputations 4(a) and 6(a) will go to the jury.
	


Imputations 4(b) and 6(b)


	
	Mr Rasmussen submits that the claim that the plaintiff lost her bid for compensation because she exaggerated her injuries is derived from the respective headlines, as well as from paragraph 4 in each article, which states the plaintiff “lost her bid for compensation, including a cleaner for her luxury five-bed, four-bathroom house, after a judge found she was exaggerating her injuries”.
	
	
	Mr Lewis submits that the ordinary reasonable reader would be aware there was more to losing a claim for compensation than doing so merely because the damages were exaggerated. The ordinary reasonable reader would understand that the plaintiff lost her claim for a range of reasons, such as the apparent reference to contributory negligence issues, and that compensation and liability for negligence are two different aspects of the case. The ordinary reasonable reader would understand that merely exaggerating injuries would not result in the loss of a case where the judge was satisfied that the accident really occurred, and that the plaintiff suffered injury as a result.
	
	
	However, the ordinary reasonable reader is not aware of the kind of legal niceties to which Mr Lewis refers and, even if the ordinary reasonable reader did have some such understanding of the legal issues involved in a claim for damages for personal injury, this confusingly structured and poorly written report unambiguously states that the plaintiff lost her “bid for compensation… after a judge found she was exaggerating her injuries”. The inclusion of the findings that she did have a trolley accident, and that the trial judge was satisfied she suffered injuries, is not inconsistent in the manner claimed by Mr Lewis. The sting of the libel is that the plaintiff lost the case because she exaggerated, despite having suffered a genuine accident, because the trial judge did not accept her evidence.
	
	
	Mr Lewis further submitted that this imputation should be struck out as incapable of arising because the only “exaggeration” referred to in the article related to the plaintiff’s claim of neck injury. I have dealt with this argument in my consideration of imputations 4(c) and 6(c) below.
	
	
	The objection in form is that this imputation “largely replicates” the words of the matter complained of. The submission is made that the use of such exact words may have a tendency to fail to achieve what Mr Lewis calls “adequate precision”. In this regard, Mr Lewis refers to Harvey v John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd at [118]-[132], a decision concerning the form of imputations under the repealed legislation, where the imputation, not the matter complained of, was the cause of action (s 9 Defamation Act 1974 (NSW)).
	
	
	Even under the repealed legislation, a plaintiff was not required to be more specific in his or her imputation than the text of the matter complained of: Drummoyne Municipal Council v Australian Broadcasting Corporation at 137. In Hepburn v TCN Channel Nine Pty Ltd [1983] 2 NSWLR 682 at 688B-C, Hutley JA stated:
	


“Though a defendant is entitled to know the case he has to meet, it is strange to hear the suggestion that this defendant does not understand an imputation which is precisely in the words it has used, so that it is embarrassed in justifying it. This must mean it does not know what it is alleged an ordinary reasonable hearer would make of it.”


	
	This is the first of many statements by the New South Wales Court of Appeal concerning the entitlement of a party to plead an imputation using some of the language of the matter complained of. The correctness of Hepburn v TCN Channel Nine Pty Ltd was restated forcefully by Kirby J (albeit in dissent) in Drummoyne Municipal Council v Australian Broadcasting Corporation at 144 and 148. Ten years later, Hodgson JA (in John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd v Blake; David Syme & Co Ltd v Blake at [52]-[54]), referring to both Hepburn v TCN Channel Nine Pty Ltd and Drummoyne Municipal Council v Australian Broadcasting Corporation, held that a pleader could use the words of the matter complained of. In Mahommed v Channel Seven Sydney Pty Ltd [2006] NSWCA 213 at [29], McColl JA considered that the use of the words of the matter complained of was permissible. In Toben v Milne [2014] NSWCA 200 at [21] the Court of Appeal noted that, while Harvey v John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd contains a warning that repeating the words in the publication may not an encapsulate the sting, an imputation may “plead or closely follow the exact words used in the alleged defamatory publication”, citing John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd v Rivkin [2003] HCA 50; 201 ALR 77 at [63].
	
	
	The use of the words from the matter complained of captures the sting of the portions of the matter complained of giving rise to this imputation. The headlines in both matters complained of, the reference to exaggeration of injuries in paragraphs 4, 11 and 13, and the description of the judge’s reasons for rejecting the plaintiff’s claim (such as the reference in paragraph 13 to the judge having “accepted the council’s claim that she was exaggerating”) are pitched at the same level of precision as the words in the imputation, and for this reason I am satisfied that this imputation’s form captures the meaning with the requisite degree of precision.
	
	
	This imputation is capable of being conveyed and imputations 4(b) and 6(b) will go to the jury.
	


Imputations 4(c) and 6(c)


	
	Somewhat inconsistently, having argued that imputations 4(b) and 6(b) are incapable of arising because the exaggerated injury in question was to only the plaintiff’s neck, Mr Lewis argued that an imputation to this effect was also incapable of arising, for the same reasons as his objections to imputations 4(b) and 6(b).
	
	
	While I reject this argument, I accept his submission that these imputations and imputations 4(b) and 6(b) cannot simultaneously arise. This imputation should be pleaded as a fall back imputation to imputations 4(b) and 6(b).
	


Imputations 4(d) and 6(d)


	
	Leave was granted to the plaintiff to replead this imputation as: “The plaintiff attempted to deceive the New South Wales District Court by exaggerating her injuries in her claim for compensation.”
	


Imputations 4(e) and 6(e)


	
	An imputation of knowingly bringing a “false” claim is incapable of arising. This was not a “false” claim for compensation. The gravamen of the matter complained of is that the plaintiff brought an exaggerated claim, but states that the court found she suffered a genuine injury, in the course of an accident which did in fact occur. The claim cannot therefore be said to be “false”. Similarly, the matter complained of does not assert that the plaintiff “knowingly” brought a false claim.
	
	
	Imputations 4(e) and 6(e) are struck out
	


Costs


	
	The parties have had more or less equal success and the costs should be the costs in the cause.
	


Future case management


	
	The defendant has raised issues in relation to the form of the pleading of the website publication. It is always desirable, particularly where defamation proceedings are commenced at the end of the limitation period, to indicate the date and place of the downloading of the matter complained of. Mr Lewis also seeks details of the “relationship” of the persons who downloaded the second matter complained of. I assume the relevance of this information is to damages. It will avoid further delay if the plaintiff provides this information. I have accordingly stood these proceedings over to Thursday 2 July 2015 for further directions.
	
	
	I note the defendant has served a notice to retain documentation. Given the inadequacies and limitations of the discovery provisions in rr 21.1 and 21.3 Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW) (Palavi v Radio 2UE Sydney Pty Ltd [2011] NSWCA 264 at [18], [59], [60], [74](e) and [113]), such a course is becoming necessary as a general precaution.

	With her trolley so full of groceries that she couldn’t see over it, and her daughter seated inside, Ms Cavic [sic] claimed in the District Court that the slope of the Willoughby Council carpark forced her to pull back on the trolley in a bid to stop it falling over.
	
	
	But it toppled after hitting a pothole, causing both the trolley and her daughter to fall on top of her, injuring her neck, upper back, lower back, left hip and right thigh.
	
	
	The court heard Ms Cavric, 40, of Northbridge, sought treatment from two orthopedic [sic] surgeons, a psychologist and a pain specialist to treat her injuries from the 2011 accident.
	
	
	The Liverpool Boys High School teacher claimed she was forced to quit her job as a result of the pain and hire a $200-a-week cleaner.

	The court heard that scans of her injuries had failed to reveal the cause of her pain, although her left knee had a torn meniscus. District Court Judge Michael Elkaim said he believed Ms Cavric was injured, but accepted the council’s claim she was exaggerating.
	
	
	He said covert surveillance of Ms Cavric suggested she was able to move her neck more significantly than she exhibited in the witness box.
	
	
	“Other than for the left knee there is no objective evidence of injury,” he said. “I do not accept the extent of the neck injury that she alleges. This conclusion is primarily based on the surveillance material where her neck movements are significantly greater than those she described or exhibited in the witness box.

	Mr [sic] Elkaim also said Ms Cavric should have exercised more care by not necessarily doing all her shopping in one go, noting how she lived close by and did not work full-time. Mr [sic] Elkaim calculated the breakdown of costs which could have been awarded to Ms Cavric would have amounted to $285,000, including $73,000 for past and future domestic assistance. However, he found in favour of the council.
	
	
	Ms Cavric declined to comment. Her husband Ned, who has provided consultancy services to NSW Compensation Lawyers, said the couple was “considering our options”.

	Woman hit by a shopping trolley loses her bid for compensation as judge rules she exaggerated her injuries

	A WOMAN who fell under an out-of-control shopping trolley has lost her bid for compensation, including a cleaner for her luxury five-bed, four-bathroom house, after a judge found she was exaggerating her injuries.
	
	
	Despina Cavric, a mother of three, was wheeling her weekly shopping to her car at Northbridge Plaza, on Sydney’s North Shore, with her then two-year-old daughter and three-year-old son.
	
	
	With her trolley so full of groceries that she couldn’t see over it, and her daughter seated inside, Ms Cavic [sic] claimed in the District Court that the slope of the Willoughby Council carpark forced her to pull back on the trolley in a bid to stop it falling over.
	
	
	But it toppled after hitting a pothole, causing both the trolley and her daughter to fall on top of her, injuring her neck, upper back, lower back, left hip and right thigh.
	
	
	The court heard Ms Cavric, 40, of Northbridge, sought treatment from two orthopedic [sic] surgeons, a psychologist and a pain specialist to treat her injuries from the 2011 accident, and had since been receiving up to 20 “glucose injections” every two to three weeks from a doctor.
	
	
	The Liverpool Boys High School teacher claimed she was forced to quit her job as a result of the pain and hire a $200-a-week cleaner to help with home duties.
	
	
	Ms Cavric also hired a gardener, although he had since been let go with her husband Ned mowing the lawn.
	
	
	The court heard that scans of her injuries had failed to reveal the cause of her pain, although her left knee had a torn meniscus. District Court Judge Michael Elkaim said he believed Ms Cavric was injured, but accepted the council’s claim she was exaggerating.

		26 June 2015",2015-06-24 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2703175,Primmer v Regina [2015] NSWCCA 155,"Judgment


	
	BASTEN JA: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against a sentence of imprisonment for 3 years 6 months imposed by Conlon DCJ in the District Court at Wollongong. The offence was dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm, for which a maximum penalty of 7 years imprisonment is specified, pursuant to s 52A(3) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW).
	
	
	The circumstances of the offending and the offender are recounted in the judgment of Hamill J. The young female victim suffered horrendous injuries, including serious and permanent brain damage. But for one matter, I would not have considered the sentence to be outside an appropriate range. There are a number of features of the applicant’s behaviour which render the guidelines provided by the judgment of this Court more than a decade ago in R v Whyte [2002] NSWCCA 343; 55 NSWLR 252 of limited assistance.
	
	
	I agree with Hamill J that the first ground of appeal should be upheld. Nevertheless, the Judge’s impatience with the psychologist’s report is understandable. The report identified several elements relevant to the offending, identified within par 54, set out by Hamill J at [29] below. First, Ms Durkin accepted the applicant’s report (to her) that he had been “distracted by his passengers around the time of the collision”. The judge was entitled to reject the suggestion of distraction as unfounded in the evidence.
	
	
	Secondly, Ms Durkin considered that his cognitive difficulties would affect his ability to “moderate his conduct while driving” and “effectively manage any issue that arose”. Once distraction is rejected, the issues that arose were entirely of the applicant’s own making. Nevertheless, a reduced ability to moderate and regulate his own conduct was clearly part of Ms Durkin’s analysis which was not contradicted by any other evidence and is by no means inherently implausible. To the extent that it provided some explanation for the dangerous driving, it was not legitimate to dismiss the explanation on the basis that it was in some way inconsistent with or discredited by the conduct it sought to explain.
	
	
	Thirdly, Ms Durkin considered that the applicant’s cognitive capacity would have been further impaired by the effects of the drug “ice”. The trial judge did not avert to that factor, although it would have been open to him to treat the diminution in intellectual functioning as partly explained by the effect of the drug and for that reason not excusable.
	
	
	In this respect there was a lacuna in the evidence. Commenting on the results from the blood and urine samples, Dr Perl, a clinical forensic pharmacologist, said there would have been “some impairment” of the offender’s driving ability. Ms Durkin had that material available to her but did not specifically comment on precisely how it interrelated with his intellectual disability.
	
	
	Accepting that the applicant suffers from an intellectual disability, it becomes necessary to identify whether, and if so to what extent, the disability affected his moral culpability for the offence and the extent to which his condition will affect the circumstances of any period of imprisonment. There was evidence which warranted a reduction in an otherwise appropriate sentence for both reasons. However, a degree of caution is required in equating intellectual disability with mental illness, let alone an unspecified mental illness. The passages from R v Israil [2002] NSWCCA 255 set out below at [49], illustrate the point. One particular matter noted in Israil at [23] was that mental illness may affect the ability of an offender to understand or appreciate “the wrongfulness of the act”. Such a feature of particular circumstances may be significant in more than one respect. It may, for example, limit the assessment of moral culpability; it may also explain a possible absence of remorse. There was no evidence of such a characteristic in the present case: reference to such matters may distract attention from the real issues.
	
	
	Given the seriousness of the offending and the tragic consequences, the sentencing judge acted quite appropriately in considering a sentence which was in the upper range of the available sentencing options. A significant period of imprisonment was required as an appropriate means of denouncing the conduct involved in the offending: Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW), s 3A(f). A significant sentence was also appropriate in the expectation that it would act as a serious deterrent to the offender, and encourage him to abandon his repeated activities of driving without a licence, as well as in an irresponsible and dangerous manner, posing risks of serious harm not merely to strangers but to those closest to him.
	
	
	Nevertheless, the intellectual disability identified by the psychologists should have been accepted as significantly lowering the level of his moral culpability. I agree with Hamill J that an appropriate sentence would have been imprisonment for 4 years. Given the early plea, he is entitled to a discount of 25%, reducing the sentence to one of 3 years.
	
	
	The sentencing judge accepted that the statutory ratio between the non-parole period and balance of term should be varied and made a finding of “special circumstances” for the purposes of s 44 of the Sentencing Procedure Act. The judge did so on the basis that the applicant does suffer from an intellectual disability, that this will be his first time in custody and that gaol will be “a difficult place for him”. Further, there may be advantages in extending the norm for the period of supervised release in the community.
	
	
	I would have imposed a non-parole period of 2 years with a balance of term of 1 year, giving a total sentence of 3 years imprisonment. The non-parole period would date from 6 December 2013 and expire on 5 December 2015, when he would be entitled to release on parole: Sentencing Procedure Act, s 50. However, that is a minority view. In other respects I agree with the orders proposed by Hamill J.
	
	
	GARLING J: I agree with Hamill J.
	
	
	HAMILL J: Shaun Primmer (the applicant) seeks leave to appeal against a sentence imposed in the District Court sitting at Wollongong on 25 June 2014 by his Honour Judge Conlon. The applicant was sentenced on his plea of guilty to one charge of dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm, an offence contrary to s 52A(3)(c) Crimes Act 1900 carrying a maximum penalty of seven years imprisonment. The applicant was arrested on the day of the offence (6 December 2013) and remained in custody until sentence was imposed. The plea of guilty was entered in the Local Court on 7 May 2014 and the primary Judge reduced the sentence by 25% to acknowledge the utilitarian value of the plea.
	
	
	The sentencing proceedings took place on 20 June 2014 and Conlon DCJ reserved his decision. On 25 June 2014 his Honour imposed a sentence comprising a non-parole period of two years and six months commencing on 6 December 2013 and expiring on 5 June 2016. There was an additional term of 12 months expiring 5 June 2017. The total sentence was three and half years. The applicant was disqualified from driving for a period of 10 years.
	
	
	At the same time the applicant was dealt with in relation to a number of other offences. These were offences in relation to which the applicant had been dealt with in the Local Court by the imposition of bonds under s 9 or s 10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (“the Sentencing Act”). The various bonds were revoked and a series of fixed term sentences were imposed. Those sentences were concurrent with, and subsumed by, the sentence subject to this appeal. All of the other sentences have expired.
	
	
	The applicant does not complain about the disqualification period or the concurrent sentences imposed on revocation of the bonds. The application is directed toward the sentence imposed for the offence under s 52A. The grounds of appeal are as follows:
	



	
	The learned sentencing judge erred in rejecting the evidence that the applicant’s intellectual disability contributed to the commission of the offence.
	
	
	The learned sentencing judge erred in his application of the finding of special circumstances.
	
	
	The sentence in all the circumstances is manifestly excessive.
	



	
	The facts of the offence were not in dispute. A document styled “Agreed Facts” was tendered and Conlon DCJ accepted those facts which were as follows:
	


“1.   At about 8.29pm on 6 December 2013, the offender was the driver of a white Ford Falcon sedan bearing registration UYL-434. Accompanying the offender in the front passenger seat was [a] 14 year old [female victim]. Timothy Lukian occupied the driver's side back seat.

2.   The offender drove the car in a nominal southerly direction on Graham Street, Unanderra. Graham Street is a residential street and provides for one traffic lane in each direction and is unmarked. The speed limit in this area is 50km/hr. A witness Stephen Page heard the engine of a car revving loudly as it travelled down Graham Street then saw the Ford driving with its tyres screeching and turned right into Waples Road. This intersection is posted with a stop sign. As the car made the turn, Page observed that the car accelerated further and veered onto the wrong side of the road.

3.   Whilst attempting to make this turn the offender lost control of the car. The car began rotating in a clockwise direction before leaving the roadway. At this point the car has gone up the curb and collided heavily with a wooden power pole outside 24 Waples Road.

4.   The offender and Lukian were able to free themselves from the car. Mr Page was the first to attend the scene and provide assistance. He saw the offender get out of the car and heard him say ""I've got to go, I've got no licence.” Mr Page told the offender to stay where he was as Page attended the victim. [The victim] was trapped in the car unresponsive and suffering from critical injuries. She was released by rescue personnel within one hour and was airlifted to Westmead Hospital for emergency treatment.

5.   The victim is currently being treated by Dr Heather Burnett at The Children's Hospital at Westmead. Dr Burnett states that [the victim] sustained multiple serious injuries including severe traumatic brain injury, left hemiplegia (arm and leg weakness and stiffness), pelvic fractures and contusions of her lungs, spleen, pancreas and left, kidney. She required medical and neurosurgical management in the Paediatric Intensive Care Unit which included:

i)   intubation and ventilation

ii)   medical management of increased intracranial pressure

iii)   management of abnormal muscle tone with medication, splinting and botulinum toxin injections

iv)   acute and chronic pain management

v)   medical management for behavioural disturbance

vi)   gastrostomy placement for management of feeding difficulty.

vii)   Intensive rehabilitation which included physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech pathology and social work support as an inpatient.

6.   Since the date of admission, [the victim’s] condition has improved however the victim remains significantly impaired with regard to her motor function, cognition, and continues to experience significant behavioural disturbance and chronic pain. As a result of this severe brain injury, the victim has irreversible brain damage that will continue to affect her motor function, cognition, memory and behaviour on a permanent basis. She will require long-term rehabilitation and a supported living arrangement due to her injuries. She remains an inpatient of the hospital to this day.

7.   The offender and Lukian suffered minor injury. A breath test of the offender at the scene returned a negative reading. Blood and urine samples taken from the offender after the collision returned positive results as follows:

Amphetamine 0.05mg/L

Methylamphetamine 0.12mg/L

Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol <0.005mg/L

Delta-9-THC acid 0.028mg/L

8.   Upon review of the matter Dr Perl Clinical Forensic Pharmacologist opined there would have been some impairment of the offender's driving ability under the influence of the illicit drugs.

9.   Analysis of the crash site was conducted by Senior Constable Jimmy Hayward on the night of the collision. The weather and conditions at the time of the crash were fine, cool and dry. The crash occurred approximately 36 minutes after the sun had set. The road surface was in good condition. S/C Hayward identified two scuff marks which followed a diverging radial trajectory across the roadway. The outer scuff mark (scuff mark A) measured a radius of 67.17 metres, whilst the inner scuff mark measured a radius of 68.32 (scuff mark B). Scuff mark A was approximately 44m in length and concluded at the concrete guttering of the eastbound lane. Scuff mark B was approximately 40m in length concluding on the guttering of the eastbound lane.

10.   The trajectory and characteristics of the scuff marks conclusively determine that the car had lost lateral stability and commenced to rotate (yaw) in a clockwise direction prior to its departure from the roadway and subsequent collision with the pole. It was noted that striations within the scuff marks were clearly visible. The appearance and orientation of the striations within the scuff marks confirm that no braking or acceleration had been applied during the car's loss of control.

11.   An analysis of speed determined that at the time the car began to lose control it was travelling between 82.27km/h and 95.12km/h.

12.   The car was examined by Senior Constable Ben Wilson who found there was no mechanical defect or failure with the vehicle that may have contributed towards the collision occurring.

13.   The offender had never held a licence and had been disqualified from obtaining a licence for 3 years after being sentenced at Wollongong Local Court on 26 November 2013 for being unlicensed and following a police pursuit. The car was unregistered (expired 1/7/2013) and uninsured at the time of the collision.”


	
	The primary Judge assessed the moral culpability of the applicant as high. His Honour found that the offender abandoned responsibility in the sense discussed by Spigelman CJ in the guideline judgment for offences under s 52A: see R v Whyte [2002] NSWCCA 343; 55 NSWLR 252 at [223].
	
	
	The sentencing court received into evidence a victim impact statement prepared by the victim’s mother. His Honour described the injury to the victim as catastrophic and the “impact on the victim and her family” as heartbreaking. These descriptions were apt although questions arise of the kind discussed by the Court (Basten JA, Simpson and Adamson JJ) in RL v R [2015] NSWCCA 106 at [51]-[57] and by Simpson J in R v Tuala [2015] NSWCCA 8. As no ground of appeal is addressed to this aspect of his Honour’s judgment no more need be said about the matter. Conlon DCJ determined that the “extent of injury and emotional harm clearly amounts to an aggravating factor under s 21A(2)(g) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act”.
	
	
	Another aggravating feature was the fact that the applicant had never held a driver’s licence and was a disqualified driver at the time of the offence. On 3 September 2013 he was a driver involved in a police pursuit and charged with an offence under s 51B(1) of the Crimes Act.
	


Mitigating features and matters personal to the offender


	
	The offender pleaded guilty at an early opportunity and was entitled to the 25% discount provided by the sentencing Judge.
	
	
	As his Honour said, the plea was also relevant to the question of remorse. There was a strong body of evidence establishing that the applicant was remorseful. This came in the form of references, a pre-sentence report and in two psychological reports. His mother wrote a letter in which she said that the applicant wished that he had been injured rather than the victim whom he “loved like a little sister, as she was virtually living with us for the last year or so before the accident”. The applicant had difficulties sleeping. He was taking sleeping pills and having nightmares every night. Conlon DCJ was satisfied that the applicant’s expressions of contrition were genuine.
	
	
	His Honour held that the applicant’s driving record did not entitle him to leniency. He had never held a licence. In January 2011 he was convicted of driving at a speed and in a manner dangerous and police pursuit. In November 2013 he was charged with being an unlicensed driver, driving whilst disqualified, police pursuit and larceny. He had also been dealt with in the Children’s Court for criminal offences committed in 2010.
	
	
	The applicant was born on 5 August 1994. He was 19 years old at the time of the offence and almost 20 when he stood to be sentenced. He had an intellectual disability as a result of which he was bullied at school. His mother said that he was “getting a hard time in [gaol]” because he was a “big boy but a gentle giant who doesn’t stand up for himself so they try to stand over him”. A referee (Ms Beljan) said that the applicant had a “troubled life” but was “doing good until his parents got evicted”. She said that he “does not think things through as he hasn’t got the capacity as the majority of us do”.
	
	
	The pre-sentence report referred to his behavioural and social problems at school. It said that he was subject to bullying and harassment at school because of his height and learning difficulties. He told the author of the report that he received insufficient support and was treated differently to others. Under the heading “FACTORS RELATING TO OFFENDING” the report quoted an earlier psychological report that “indicates that Mr Primmer presents with a mild to moderate level of intellectual impairment and requires assistance with many areas of everyday living, compared with same age peers.”
	
	
	The reference to the earlier psychological report was a reference to a report of a psychologist, Liz Kramer, dated 31 August 2012. Based on the results of intelligence testing, Ms Kramer had reported “with 95% confidence” that the offender’s IQ was within the “lower extreme range”. There was a discrepancy between his verbal and non-verbal abilities making assessment difficult. In relation to the “non-verbal composite” he scored in the “lower extreme” range with 99.9% of same age peers outscoring him. He scored “extremely low” on a measure of adaptive functioning. Taken together, he presented with “a Mild to Moderate level of intellectual impairment.” He requires assistance with many areas of everyday life.
	
	
	Laura Durkin, psychologist, provided a report for the purpose of the sentencing hearing. The opinions stated in that report are central to the first ground of appeal. Ms Durkin was not required for cross-examination and the Crown did not challenge the opinions stated in her report. Her report set out her qualifications and she agreed to be bound by the Expert Witness Code of Conduct (Schedule 7, Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005). Ms Durkin interviewed the offender and administered some tests. Her interview was cut a little short due to a lock down at the gaol and “gaol imposed time restrictions”. She had read the facts sheet, the criminal history and earlier psychological reports including that of Ms Kramer.
	
	
	Ms Durkin referred to the offender’s poor social functioning and the fact that he was bullied because he was considered to be a “dope”. He was taken advantage of by friends and fell in with a group of delinquent peers. In spite of his attempts to gain acceptance, he was mistreated and even assaulted. He described symptoms of depression and outbursts of anger but “struggled to recall his mental health historically”. He described his feelings for the victim and symptoms consistent with a “post-traumatic stress response”. Ms Durkin provided a thorough review of the documentation. She noted that a report in 2011 under the hand of Ms Esme Nasser, clinical psychologist, described the applicant as being in the “intellectually deficient range” and that his “impairments were global”. Another report from 2011 by Mr Matthew Lampen, clinical nurse consultant, said that there was a “developmental disability”. This was based on interviews and document review rather than psychometric testing. Ms Durkin analysed the report of Ms Kramer in some detail.
	
	
	Ms Durkin referred to the influence of his antisocial peer group and his “emotion dysregulation” as having a significant impact on his offending behaviour. She then provided the following opinion:
	


“54.   In addition to the aforementioned, there are other factors that appear to have influenced Mr Primmer’s offending. Although this assessment cannot confirm Mr Primmer’s exact level of functioning or the presence of intellectual disability, all information available to me would suggested that Mr Primmer is deficient intellectually and that his adaptive functioning is poor, indicating that he would meet diagnosis for intellectual disability. Three other clinicians have confirmed this impairment and I would expect their conclusions to remain accurate given the life long nature of such disability. Given this, Mr Primmer is likely to struggle with attention, comprehension, perception, memory and thinking generally. This can affect his problem solving, consequential thinking, capacity for self-regulation, and self-moderation. Indeed, there are examples of his weaknesses in these domains, as outlined in this report. However, specifically related to the offending, it is likely that Mr Primmer’s cognitive difficulties affected his ability to attend appropriately while driving, concentrate on the task at hand, moderate his conduct while driving, effectively manage any issues that arose and understand or implement the best course of action in a timely manner if a problem arose. Further to this, Mr Primmer reported being distracted by his passengers around the time of the collision. For an individual with already compromised intellectual ability, distraction is only likely to exacerbate his weaknesses. Added to these factors, Mr Primmer reported being intoxicated on ‘ice’ and, thus combined, his cognitive capacity would have been notably impaired.”

GROUNDS OF APPEAL

Ground 1:“The learned sentencing judge erred in rejecting the evidence that the applicant’s intellectual disability contributed to the commission of the offence.”


	
	The sentencing judge set out various passages from Ms Durkin’s report. His Honour quoted paragraph 54 of the report (set out above at [29]). His Honour then said:
	


“In respect of those last mentioned observations I am unable to accept that his “intellectual functioning” contributed to the commission of the offence in a material way. Courts are regularly provided with reports from psychologists who no doubt do their best to ameliorate the conduct of the persons that they are interviewing.

As earlier observed, his driving complete with revving engine, screeching tyres and speed was typical of many like-minded, young, irresponsible drivers who believe that they are impressing their friends. In other words, showing off or aggressive driving that all too often ends in tragedy. That driving as observed by the witness simply had nothing to do with any passenger distracting him. Indeed, the dangerous driving was simply inconsistent with such a suggestion and I reject it. I have already referred to the facts in respect of the police pursuit in September 10 days before this particular offence. He was not distracted then, he showed complete ability to be able to observe police and manage by his aggressive driving on that occasion to escape them.”


	
	A sentencing Judge is not bound to act on the opinions of expert witnesses even where there is no challenge to those opinions. However, the basis of the rejection of Ms Durkin’s opinion demonstrated error of a significant kind. It was based on two inappropriate generalisations.
	
	
	First, it was suggested that Ms Durkin was a witness of a kind who “no doubt do their best to ameliorate the conduct of the person’s they are interviewing.” There was no evidence to support this suggestion. The report was thoughtful and balanced. Ms Durkin agreed to be bound by the Expert Code of Conduct. The responded submitted that this comment might be seen as merely “infelicitous”. It is certainly that and brings to mind the “unholy trinity” observation that was subject to criticism in Vakauta v Kelly [1989] HCA 44; 167 CLR 568 at 572-573.
	
	
	Second, it was based on a generalisation of the behaviour of “like-minded, young irresponsible drivers who believe they are impressing their friends”. The comment appeared to disregard the individual circumstances and difficulties of the applicant: contra R v Latouf (NSWCCA, Mahoney ACJ, 12 December 1996, unrep).
	
	
	The fact that the applicant had committed an earlier offence involving a police pursuit did not logically discredit the opinion of Ms Durkin. His conduct on the earlier occasion was equally likely to have been influenced by his “difficulties in problem solving, consequential thinking, capacity for self-regulation and self moderation.”
	
	
	Ms Durkin’s opinion as to the causal connexion between the applicant’s intellectual disability and his offending behaviour was significant in a proper assessment of the applicant’s moral culpability for the offence for which he was to be sentenced: R v Israil at [24] (Spigelman CJ).
	
	
	In Kentwell v The Queen [2014] HCA 37; 313 ALR 451 the High Court considered the proper approach to be taken under s 6(3) of Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) once error is established in an appeal against sentence. At [40]-[42] French CJ, Hayne, Bell and Keane JJ approved of the approach suggested by Spigelman CJ in Baxter v R [2007] NSWCCA 237; 173 A Crim R 284. Their Honours went on at [42]:
	


“42.   … When a judge acts upon wrong principle, allows extraneous or irrelevant matters to guide or affect the determination, mistakes the facts or does not take into account some material consideration, the Court of Criminal Appeal does not assess whether and to what degree the error influenced the outcome. The discretion in such a case has miscarried and it is the duty of the Court of Criminal Appeal to exercise the discretion afresh taking into account the purposes of sentencing and the factors that the Sentencing Act, and any other Act or rule of law, require or permit. As sentencing is a discretionary judgment that does not yield a single correct result, it follows that a range of sentences in a given case may be said to be ""warranted in law"". A sentence that happens to be within the range but that has been imposed as the result of a legally flawed determination is not ""warranted in law"" unless, in the exercise of its independent discretion, the Court of Criminal Appeal determines that it is the appropriate sentence for the offender and the offence. This is not to say that all errors in the sentencing of offenders vitiate the exercise of the sentencer's discretion. By way of example, s 44(1) of the Sentencing Act requires the court when sentencing an offender to imprisonment to first set the non-parole period and then set the balance of the term. Prior to 1 February 2003, a court was required to first set the term of the sentence and then specify the non-parole period. A court which sentences an offender to imprisonment after 1 February 2003 by first setting the term of the sentence commits legal error. Without more, the error does not affect the exercise of the sentencer's discretion.

43.   After having identified specific error of the kind described in House, the Court of Criminal Appeal may conclude, taking into account all relevant matters, including evidence of events that have occurred since the sentence hearing, that a lesser sentence is the appropriate sentence for the offender and the offence. This is a conclusion that that lesser sentence is warranted in law. The result of the Court of Criminal Appeal's independent exercise of discretion may be the conclusion that the same sentence or a greater sentence is the appropriate sentence. In neither case is the Court required to re-sentence.

[Footnotes omitted]”


	
	On my independent assessment of all of the evidence, including an affidavit read in the event of re-sentencing, I have concluded that a less severe sentence is warranted. I will return to articulate the reasons for that conclusion.
	
	
	Ground 1 has been established. The appeal should be allowed, the sentence quashed and the applicant re-sentenced.
	


Ground 2:“The learned sentencing judge erred in his application of the findings of special circumstances.”


	
	The sentencing Judge found that there were special circumstances pursuant to s 44 of the Sentencing Act. The non-parole period was adjusted downwards by a small degree. The applicant contends that the adjustment was insufficient. Ms Cook acknowledges the difficulties in interfering with a matter that lies firmly within the discretion of the sentencing Judge. In R v Cramp [2004] NSWCCA 264 it was held at [31] that the extent of an adjustment to the non-parole period upon a finding of special circumstances “raises so many matters of a discretionary character that this Court should be very slow to intervene”.
	
	
	In view of the necessity to re-sentence arising from the upholding of Ground 1, it is unnecessary to determine whether there was independent error in the application of the finding of special circumstances. I will form my own assessment in determining the appropriate sentence and non-parole period.
	


Ground 3:“The sentence in all the circumstances is manifestly excessive.”


	
	Because I have concluded that the applicant must be re-sentenced, it is strictly unnecessary to consider this ground at length. However, in my view the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive.
	
	
	In coming to that conclusion, I am mindful that sentencing is a discretionary exercise, that there is no single correct sentence and that this Court is not permitted to substitute its own opinion as to an appropriate sentence: Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at [27]-[28]. The applicant must establish that the sentence imposed by the sentencing judge was ""unreasonable"", ""plainly unjust"", or ""manifestly wrong"": see, for example, Dinsdale v The Queen [2000] HCA 54; 202 CLR 321 per Gaudron and Gummow JJ at [22].
	
	
	As Ms Cook pointed out, the starting point, before the 25% reduction based on the plea of guilty, was a total sentence of four years and eight months. That is against a maximum penalty of seven years and the guideline judgment in R v Whyte where Spigelman CJ spoke of a sentence (non-parole period and additional term) of at least two years where there was an abandonment of responsibility and a plea of limited utilitarian value. In view of the applicant’s subjective case, and giving full account to the seriousness of the offending and the devastating nature of the injuries suffered by the fourteen year old victim, the starting point of four years and eight months is indicative of error.
	
	
	It may be that the manifest excess was a direct result of the error identified under Ground 1 and his Honour’s treatment of the applicant’s intellectual disability. His Honour rejected a submission that the applicant’s disability was such that he was not an appropriate vehicle for general deterrence. While accepting that general deterrence remained an important consideration, I would give it far less weight than it would receive in the case of an offender who did not suffer from the applicant’s intellectual disability.
	
	
	I would also uphold Ground 3.
	


A LESS SEVERE SENTENCE IS WARRANTED


	
	In re-exercising the sentencing discretion, I pay careful attention to the maximum penalty of seven years: cf Markarian at [30]-[31].
	
	
	I have considered the guideline judgment in R v Whyte, noting that the two year guideline was what was considered the minimum appropriate sentence when there was an abandonment of responsibility. The present case has many features of the “frequently recurring case” referred to at [204]. There were present a number of the aggravating features referred to in paragraph [216]. As other members of this Court have pointed out, the guideline judgment was not ""unduly prescriptive in setting out a range of sentences for a typical case"" and that the court ""made no reference to the upper limits of such a sentence but endeavoured to indicate a lower limit for a typical case"": see WW v R [2012] NSWCCA 165 per Hoeben CJ at CL at [74]-[76]; see also Stanyard v R [2013] NSWCCA 134 per Fullerton J at [40].
	
	
	An important feature of the present case was the evidence concerning the applicant’s intellectual disability. The relevance of such evidence to the proper exercise of the sentencing discretion was considered by the High Court in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120 and Bugmy v The Queen [2013] HCA 37; 249 CLR 571. As Ms Cook pointed out in oral submissions the evidence and description of the applicant’s disability was similar to that considered by the High Court in Muldrock. The Court said at [50] that “[t]he assessment that the appellant suffers from a ‘mild intellectual disability’ should not obscure the fact that he is mentally retarded.”
	
	
	It is well established that an offender's intellectual capacity may impact upon sentencing in a variety of ways, not all of which are dependent upon a causal link being established between the condition and the offending. In R v Israil Spigelman CJ said at [21]-[26]:
	


""21.   The significance of mental illness of an offender in the sentencing exercised has long been accepted. The relevant authorities have been reviewed in this Court, the Victorian Court of Appeal and the Western Australian Full Court. See R v Fahda [1999] NSWCCA 267 at [40]-[48] per Simpson J; R v Harb [2001] NSWCCA 249 at [35]-[45] per Smart AJ; see also R v Lauritsen (2000) 114 A Crim R 333, esp [43]-[51] per Malcolm CJ; R v Tsiaras [1996] 1 VR 398 at 400; see also Potas, Sentencing Manual: Law Principles and Practice in New South Wales 2001 at 285-286; Fox and Freiberg, Sentencing State and Federal Law in Victoria (2nd ed), 1999 at 293-294.

22.   In the present case, the Crown was prepared to concede that some mitigation was appropriate, on the basis of giving less weight to the issue of general deterrence. However, that is not the only way in which mental illness impinges on the exercise of the sentencing discretion.

23.   To the extent that mental illness explains the offence - as her Honour found to be the position in the present case - then an offender's inability to understand the wrongfulness of his actions, or to make reasonable judgments, or to control his or her faculties and emotions, will impact on the level of culpability of the offender, even where the illness does not amount to an excuse at law. As Wood CJ at CL put it in Henry, supra, at [254]:

'... the community will readily understand that the offender who suffers from a mental disorder or abnormality is less in control of his or her cognitive facilities or emotional restraints, and in some instances lacks the ability to make reasoned or ordered judgments. Almost invariably there is a limited appreciation of the wrongfulness of the act, or of its moral culpability, which although falling short of avoiding criminal responsibility does justify special consideration upon sentencing.'

24.   I agree with the observations of Malcolm CJ in Lauritsen at [48]:

'... mental illness is not only relevant to assessing culpability, in which case it must be shown to have contributed to the offence, but it is also relevant to assessing the level of danger the offender presents and the appropriate way in which the offender is to be rehabilitated. The mental illness should be taken into account in sentencing whether or not it played a part in the commission of the offence, but not with the consequence of the imposition of a sentence which exceeds the seriousness of the offence.'

25.   Furthermore, mental illness may also lead to the conclusion in a particular case that the element of personal deterrence, not just general deterrence, is also entitled to less weight in the sentencing exercise than it may otherwise have because, as the Victorian Court of Appeal put it:

'... specific deterrence may be more difficult to achieve and is often not worth pursuing as such.' (Tsiaras, supra, at 400)

26.   Finally, a custodial sentence may weigh more heavily on a mentally ill person and that may be a material consideration in determining the length of the sentence to be served. (See Tsiaras, supra, at 400). However in Lauritsen at [51], Malcolm CJ noted that this factor, identified by the Victorian Court of Appeal in Tsiaras, may not represent the law in Western Australia. It is unnecessary to determine whether this is the law in New South Wales. It appears to have been regarded as material in this Court in R v Jiminez [1999] NSWCCA 7 at [25]. I see no reason why this would not be so, but the matter was not fully argued.”


	
	Israil was an offender with a mental illness (schizophrenia). The same principles apply to an offender with an intellectual disability although the weight to be afforded to matters of deterrence will vary from case to case depending on the circumstances and severity of the disability. In this case, the evidence suggests his disability is a serious one. I accept the evidence of Ms Durkin as to the link between the offender’s intellectual disability and his offending behaviour. I accept that his moral culpability is reduced to some degree. I accept the submission made before the primary Judge that the applicant’s condition makes him an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence. However, the prevalence and nature of the offence means that general deterrence still has some role to play. Nevertheless, the offender’s intellectual disability means that it should be given less weight than it would in many cases of this nature. On the other hand, while noting the observations in Israil and the Victorian case of Tsiaris, I accept the respondent’s submission that the applicant’s traffic record heightens the need for specific deterrence and that his intellectual disability is not such that specific deterrence should be ignored. Like the primary Judge, I accept that his experience of gaol will be (and has been) more difficult as a result of his intellectual functioning.
	
	
	No “automatic consequences follow” as a result of these findings and the existence of a causal relationship between the applicant’s condition and his offending “does not automatically produce the result that [he] will receive a lesser sentence”: see R v Engert (1995) 84 A Crim R 67 at 68, 71 (Gleeson CJ). However, my assessment is that it is a particularly important consideration in a principled assessment of the proper sentence to be imposed on this applicant.
	
	
	I have taken into account the purposes of punishment in s 3A of the Sentencing Act. The applicant must be adequately punished and made accountable for his actions. His conduct should be denounced. The harm to the victim must be recognised. She has suffered a devastating injury and her quality of life is greatly diminished. The victim impact statement demonstrates this fact in a moving and graphic way. Subject to the observations I have made about deterrence in the context of his intellectual disability, the sentence must deter the applicant and others from committing similar offences. Those purposes of punishment point toward a severe sentence. However, it is also important to promote the applicant’s rehabilitation and that objective will, in turn, serve to protect the community. Given his difficulties, I have reached the conclusion that a very lengthy period of supervised parole is the best way to achieve his rehabilitation. For that reason, the sentence I propose includes a significant adjustment to the non-parole period.
	
	
	I have considered the affidavit of Mr Eccleshall tendered in the event of re-sentencing. It details a number of difficulties that the applicant has had while in custody. It also demonstrates that, within the limits of his ability, he is making the most of his time in custody. He continues to have “flashbacks” of the car accident and shows symptoms of depression. As recently as 28 April 2015 he was “dealing with significant shame, guilt and sadness around the effect of his [offence] on the victim”. He has “deformed toes” or “clawed feet” and there are concerns that these may be caused by “neurological pathology”. There have been a number of problems with other inmates and cell-mates and he has been moved to different cells as a result. He believed he was being punished. Because of his size (he is 7 foot 3 inches – 225 cm – tall) his involvement in a cooking course was difficult because his coordination was hindered because the height of the bench.
	
	
	Synthesising all of these factors and applying the purposes and principles of sentencing, I have reached the conclusion that an appropriate and just sentence will result in the applicant’s imminent release from custody. That conclusion requires a substantial adjustment to the non-parole period following upon the finding of special circumstances under s 44. I appreciate that the non-parole period I propose may appear to some to be one at the lower end of the range in view of the seriousness of the offence and the injuries and disabilities suffered by the victim. In reaching the conclusion that the proposed non-parole period is appropriate, in addition to the matters to which I have earlier referred, I have kept in mind the observations concerning individual justice of Mahoney ACJ in R v Latouf:
	


“To see the sentencing process as involving no more than stern punishment for each offender is not merely simplistic; it damages the public interest”

“It is to be recognised that imprisonment may convert a person who will not be a persistent criminal into one who is. Particularly is this so where the person to be sentenced is a first offender of a comparatively young age whose family circumstances are such that he may, with assistance, not become a criminal. It would be wrong to the individual and costly to the community not to attempt the rehabilitation of such a person”

“There is in what the judge did an element of faith.”

RE-SENTENCING


	
	I would commence with a starting point of four years. I would reduce that by 25% to reflect the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty. That would result in a total sentence of three years. Like the sentencing Judge, I would find special circumstances pursuant to s 44 of the Sentencing Act. The special circumstances include the difficulties that the applicant has experienced while in custody and the need to foster his rehabilitation by providing for a lengthy period of supervision upon his release. For the reasons I have identified, I have made a significant adjustment to the length of the non-parole period.
	
	
	There is no suggestion that the period of disqualification should be reduced and no appeal directed to the concurrent fixed terms imposed for those matters originally dealt with in the Local Court where various bonds were revoked by the sentencing Judge.
	
	
	The orders that I propose are:
	



	
	Application for leave to appeal granted.
	
	
	Appeal allowed.
	
	
	The sentence imposed for the offence under s 52A [CAN H 52971217/1 (58912004)] is quashed and in lieu thereof the applicant is sentenced to a non-parole period of 1 year 7 months commencing on 6 December 2013 and expiring on 5 July 2015. There will be an additional term of 1 year 5 months commencing 6 July 2015 and expiring on 5 December 2016.
	
	
	The disqualification period of 10 years is confirmed.
	
	
	All other sentences imposed in the District Court on 25 June 2014 are confirmed.
	
	
	Pursuant to s 50 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 direct that the applicant to be released at the expiration of the non-parole period.

2703176,Huynh v R [2015] NSWCCA 167,"Judgment


	
	SIMPSON J:      I agree with Davies J.   
	
	
	DAVIES J:   On 6 November 2013 the Applicant pleaded guilty in the Local Court to an offence that on 20 June 2013 she imported a marketable quantity of a border controlled drug, namely heroin, contrary to s 307.2(1) of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth). The maximum penalty for this offence is 25 years imprisonment and/or a fine of $1,275,000.
	
	
	An offence of importing prohibited tier one goods without approval, namely pseudoephedrine, was taken into account on sentence pursuant to s 16BA of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth). The maximum penalty for this offence is 5 years imprisonment and/or a fine of $170,000.
	
	
	The Applicant was sentenced by his Honour Judge Lerve to imprisonment for seven years commencing 20 June 2013 and expiring 19 June 2020 with a non-parole period of four years expiring 20 June 2017.
	
	
	The Applicant, who appears unrepresented, has filed a Notice of Appeal containing the following grounds:
	


1.   Mother is unwell, residing in overseas country (Vietnam).

2.   Three children (9 years old, 16 years old and 18 years old) currently    residing in Australia.

I have recently been diagnosed with diabetes due to stress, I would like to try reduce my sentence for more parole time if possible as I need my children and they need me due to hard times.

3.   Interpreter need (sic) (Vietnamese).


	
	The Crown has inferred that these grounds of appeal are in substance, first, that the overall sentence was manifestly excessive; secondly, that no weight or insufficient weight was given to the hardship that would be caused to the Applicant’s children and parents; thirdly, that no weight or insufficient weight was given to the Applicant’s ill health. I agree that what is contained in the Notice of Appeal should be so characterised and gives rise to those considerations.
	


Factual overview


	
	What follows is a summary of the Agreed Facts at the sentencing hearing.
	
	
	The Applicant left Australia and travelled to Vietnam on 14 May 2013 because her mother was ill.
	
	
	While in Vietnam the Applicant was approached at a coffee shop when she was crying by a woman who offered to give her a job. The next day the woman gave the Applicant a Vietnamese SIM card and AUD$3,000 for medication for her mother. She was promised a further AUD$7,000 upon arrival in Australia.
	
	
	The Applicant agreed to bring something to Australia. The woman gave her four to five bags of food items which the Applicant placed in her bag. The woman showed her a pellet which had to be inserted into the Applicant. She had an injection to enable this to be done. She was asleep for about 45 minutes and her bag was not locked at that time. She knew that she was importing something illegal because she had accepted money. The Sentencing Judge said he could not find that she knew the precise nature of the drugs.
	
	
	On 20 June 2013 the Applicant arrived at Sydney International Airport on board a Vietnam Airlines flight from Ho Chi Minh City. She was selected for a routine baggage search. During the baggage search Customs officials located nine packets which the Applicant said contained flour. The packets were later found to contain a pure quantity of 423.9 grams of pseudoephedrine.
	
	
	The Applicant consented to a frisk search. The Customs officer noticed something unusual around the Applicant's groin area. The Applicant then passed a nine centimetre long pellet. She was taken to St George Hospital for a CT scan which revealed an internal concealment. The Applicant had internally concealed three pellets containing a pure quantity of 197 grams of heroin.
	


Findings of the Sentencing Judge


	
	The Applicant was born in May 1976. She was aged 37 at the time of the offending.
	
	
	The involvement of the Applicant was as a courier. She knew she was importing an illegal drug but did not know the precise nature or quantity of the drug. She became involved in the enterprise with her eyes open. She was involved for financial gain. She had a significant degree of desperation. It could not be found that she was involved in the procurement of the substance in Vietnam nor that she was going to be involved in the distribution in Australia other than handing it over to the recipient.
	
	
	The Applicant had a criminal record that did not entitle her to any particular leniency. There was a very real issue of specific deterrence as well as the issue of general deterrence relating to the importation of border controlled substances. The applicant had, previously, in 2005, been convicted of a similar offence, and had served a period of imprisonment - see [25] ff below.
	
	
	The Applicant's mother was ill and, given the Applicant will be in custody, she will be unable to help her mother.
	
	
	The Applicant gave no evidence and so the expression of remorse was given little weight. There was some minor contrition but it was very slight and untested.
	
	
	It was accepted that prison would be more difficult for the Applicant because of her separation from her three children aged 8, 16 and 18, issues relating to her mother being in Vietnam and her relatively poor command of the English language. These formed part of the overall subjective mix but did not reach the level of being truly wholly or exceptional circumstances.
	
	
	The Applicant gave past assistance which was of intelligence value only which would warrant a discount of 5%.
	
	
	The Applicant entered a plea of guilty.
	
	
	Nothing was put before the Sentencing Judge as far as the Applicant’s physical condition was concerned. There was no material by way of a psychological or psychiatric report regarding the mental health of the Applicant. It was noted from the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in 2006 and the judgment of Berman DCJ in relation to a previous offence committed by the Applicant that there were some mental health issues. They formed part of the subjective mix and could be put no higher.
	
	
	His Honour was unable to find on the balance of probabilities that there were good prospects of rehabilitation. However, that was not to say that the matter of rehabilitation was completely hopeless. His Honour was unable   to find on the balance of probabilities that the Applicant was unlikely to reoffend.
	
	
	His Honour was of the opinion that there should be a relatively lengthy period on parole. There would need to be extensive supervision to ensure that the Applicant did something useful with her life and did not get involved or re-involved with illegal drugs.
	


Ground 1:   Sentence manifestly excessive


	
	In her written submissions the Applicant makes it clear that she does not wish to appeal against her overall sentence but only the length of the non-parole period. Nothing else was said in either the written or oral submissions to suggest that any error had been made in fixing the length of the non-parole period or the sentence as a whole.
	
	
	A matter of some significance in relation to this ground of appeal is the fact that on 29 April 2005 the Applicant was arrested at Sydney Airport having been found to have imported a quantity of towels which had been impregnated with methylamphetamine. Subsequent analysis found that the towels contained a total of 537.2 grams of pure methylamphetamine. The Applicant was charged pursuant to s 233B of the Customs Act 1901 (Cth) for an offence which carried a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment and a fine of $550,000.
	
	
	The Applicant was found guilty by a jury at trial. On 4 August 2006 she was sentenced to a period of imprisonment of four years with a non-parole period of two years: R v Nguyen [2006] NSWDC1; (2006) 3 DCLR (NSW) 216.
	
	
	On a Crown appeal to this Court, the appeal was upheld and in lieu the Applicant was sentenced to a period of six years imprisonment with a non-parole period of three years: R v Nguyen [2006] NSWCCA 369; (2006) 205 FLR 79. That sentence expired on 15 June 2012. The present offence was committed on 20 June 2013.
	
	
	In upholding the Crown appeal and resentencing the Applicant James J (with whom Hidden and Hislop JJ agreed) said:
	


[30]   I am further of the opinion that the sentence imposed by his Honour was manifestly inadequate. The respondent had imported over 500 grams of methylamphetamine. Unlike many other offenders, she had not pleaded guilty but had stood trial and she had not provided any assistance to the authorities. She had not shown any contrition. The sentencing judge had declined to make a finding that she had good prospects of rehabilitation. Even after taking into account some subjective circumstances in favour of the respondent, including her difficult life, the absence of any serious previous criminal conduct, the fact that prison for the respondent would, for a number of reasons including the separation from her children, be more than usually onerous and the hardship to members of her family (to the extent to which that factor could properly be taken into account), the sentence imposed was manifestly inadequate.

…

[35]   In re-sentencing the respondent I take into account the principle that, if the Court of Criminal Appeal allows a Crown appeal, the sentence it imposes in re-sentencing the respondent will usually be less than the sentence which the Court considers should have been imposed in the first instance. I would vary the usual ratio of the non-parole period to the head sentence when sentencing for Commonwealth offences, for the same reasons and in the same way as the sentencing judge did.


	
	The Sentencing Judge was provided with a Schedule which contained a summary of what were said to be comparative cases both for the principal offence and for the offence on the Schedule.
	
	
	During the course of the sentencing hearing when those decisions were being discussed this exchange occurred between the Sentencing Judge and the Applicant’s counsel:
	


LANGE:   In my submission if your Honour has regard firstly to that sentence [Nguyen] as compared to that imposed by Bui’s case, one sees quite a range of sentences available. Because the Court of Criminal Appeal upheld a sentence of seven years in one particular case does not mean that that is a sentence which is appropriate in this particular case, just as much as I couldn’t say that –

HIS HONOUR:   It’s got to be getting up there.

LANGE:   It’s certainly getting close your Honour. I’d be disingenuous by suggesting anything to the contrary in view of the previous offence.

HIS HONOUR:   It’s the previous offence that’s the problem.


	
	Three other matters point to the conclusion that the sentence is not manifestly excessive. First, the amount of the heroin, as the Sentencing Judge noted, was nearly 100 times the marketable quantity and about one eighth of the commercial quantity. Secondly, the offence on the Schedule was itself a serious offence and the amount of the precursor involved in that offence was substantial. Had this offence been dealt with separately and not on the Schedule, the overall sentence may have been greater than was imposed. Thirdly, the ratio of the non-parole period to the head sentence was relatively low, even bearing in mind this was a Commonwealth offence.
	
	
	In my opinion, neither the overall sentence nor the non-parole period can be regarded as excessive, particularly in the light of the Applicant’s previous conviction for a very similar offence, the applicable maximum penalty and the fact that a second serious offence was taken into account in sentencing.
	


Hardship to the Applicant’s family


	
	Section 16A(2) of the Crimes Act 1914 relevantly provides:
	


In addition to any other matters, the Court must take into account such of the following matters as are relevant and known to the Court:

…

(p)   The probable effect that any sentence or order under consideration would have on any of the person’s family or dependants.


	
	That particular consideration must be read consistently with the common law so that it is necessary for the Applicant to show exceptional hardship to a third party to ameliorate an otherwise appropriate sentence: R v Togias [2001] NSWCCA 522; (2001) 127 A Crim R 23 at [13] – [17]; R v Zerafa [2013] NSWCCA 222; (2013) 235 A Crim R 265 at [93].
	
	
	The opening words to s 16A(2) refer to “matters … known to the Court”. In fact, the Sentencing Judge had scant information concerning the Applicant because little evidence was placed before him. He had a letter from the Applicant faxed on the day of the sentencing (10 July 2014) which relevantly said this:
	


My husband is in Egypt. He was refused a visa to return to Australia. …

I will miss my children, their education and grow up (sic). I have asked them to forgive me.

…

I worry each day of my mother. She is in Vietnam.

She has done so much for me, now that she is ill I cannot service her during her prime time of need.

…

I hope your Honour will give me the chance to be a mother to my children.

I have disappointed them and hope my children will grow up, be good and be educated.


	
	In addition, as noted earlier, in the Agreed Statement of Facts it was said that the Applicant went to Vietnam because her mother was very ill.
	
	
	None of that information could be said to demonstrate exceptional hardship.
	
	
	What the Applicant has sought to do at the hearing of this appeal was to place fresh evidence before this Court in relation to these matters and in relation to her own health issues.
	
	
	The Applicant has put forward documents apparently from a hospital in Vietnam where the Applicant’s mother has been treated. Although the document appears to be dated 23 April 2015 the events to which it refer concern the Applicant’s mother’s admission to hospital from 14 – 20 November 2013. There are further documents which seem to concern medication that was prescribed for the Applicant’s mother during 2012.
	
	
	On any view, the information contained in these documents was available to the Applicant at the sentence proceedings. It is necessary, therefore, for the Applicant to show that a miscarriage of justice would result if this evidence was not received: Gallagher v The Queen (1986) 160 CLR 392 at 395; R v Fordham (1997) 98 A Crim R 359 at 377; Colomer v R [2014] NSWCCA 51 at [47]-[50]. No explanation has been offered why this information was not before the Sentencing Judge. Nor has any information been offered to explain the absence of any evidence from the Applicant herself at the sentence hearing. The Applicant was legally represented at that hearing.
	
	
	The absence of the evidence sought now to be tendered did not result in a miscarriage of justice. Nor is it likely to have had any impact on the non-parole period which the Applicant received. It is not clear, in any event, what the Applicant intended to do as far as caring for her mother was concerned. She was living in Australia at the time of the offences with three children. The trip where the drugs were obtained appears to have been for a five week period, presumably to see her mother, but how many other trips there would have been to care for her mother is not known.
	
	
	A further consideration is that the Applicant could not be said to be a person who may not have realised the effect imprisonment would have on her family. It was a matter considered by both Berman DCJ and this Court in relation to her previous offence. At that time her three children were aged 10 years, 8 years, and 7 months, and arguably in greater need of their mother than at the present time, some 9 years later. It is clear also that the Applicant was aware of the needs of her mother whom she was visiting when she decided to offend.
	
	
	That is highlighted by what Berman DCJ said in his remarks concerning her previous offending:
	


[12]   …Of course balancing that consideration [being in custody away from her young children] is the fact that the offender went into this, with one exception [she did not know she was pregnant], with her eyes open. At the time she imported those drugs into Australia she knew she was the mother of two children. She knew that if detected she would go to gaol, but nevertheless she went ahead.


	
	I would reject this ground of appeal.
	


Ground 3:   Ill-health of Applicant


	
	Section 16A of the Crimes Act 1914 relevantly provides:
	


Matters to which court to have regard when passing sentence etc. - federal offences 

…

(2) In addition to any other matters, the court must take into account such of the following matters as are relevant and known to the court:

…

(m) the character, antecedents, age, means and physical or mental condition of the person;


	
	Attached to her submissions on the appeal was a report from Tim Watson-Monroe, a forensic psychologist, dated 10 July 2014 in relation to the Applicant as well as information from Justice Health some of which predated the sentence proceedings and some of which was more recent. The more recent material was an anatomical pathology report dated 9 March 2015. This report concerned two specimens from the Applicant’s cervix. They were reported as showing acutely inflamed endocervical squamous mucosa. It was said that no AIS or malignancy was seen.
	
	
	It may be accepted that the recent material was not available at the time of the sentencing proceedings. In Fordham Howie AJ (with whom Hunt CJ at CL and Smart J agreed) said:
	


Generally before fresh or new evidence will be received by this Court, it must be shown that the sentencing of the appellant in the absence of that evidence resulted in a miscarriage of justice. …

It has been held that new evidence may be admitted where the evidence has real significance to the sentencing proceedings, and where the significance of the evidence was unknown to the appellant and the existence of that evidence was not made known to the legal representatives at the time of sentencing: Goodwin (1990) 51 A Crim R 328, compare De Marco [CCA, 20 November 1995, unreported]. There is also a general power in the Court to receive fresh or new evidence where the interests of justice require that course: Many (1990) 51 A Crim R 54.


	
	I do not consider that it is appropriate that this recent evidence should be received. It is of no real significance in circumstances where there is no medical evidence to explain how what is demonstrated in the Pathology report affects the Applicant. Nor is there any evidence of what treatment, if any, is needed, and if treatment is necessary, that it cannot be provided within a custodial setting. In that way, the interests of justice do not require that it be further considered.
	
	
	As far as the remaining evidence is concerned, there is no explanation why the report of Mr Watson-Munro, which was dated the same day as the sentencing hearing, was not before the Sentencing Judge. Nothing of any significance is disclosed in the report. Mr Watson-Munro refers to her “psychological problems which date back many years” and to “an exacerbation of chronic depression”. The Sentencing Judge said that he was aware of those issues from the judgments in relation to the earlier offending.
	
	
	In her submissions the Applicant said that she had been diagnosed with diabetes whilst in custody. One of the documents attached to her submissions was a referral form from Justice Health dated 29 August 2013. In the summary of clinical notes it referred to her having Type 2 Diabetes from approximately two years earlier. It reported that she came into custody taking Diaformin XR (a drug for diabetes) and Lipidil (a cholesterol lowering drug). Not only is her assertion of having been diagnosed with diabetes whilst in custody incorrect, the material concerning this matter was clearly available at the time of the sentencing hearing.
	
	
	The Applicant does not establish any miscarriage of justice by reason of this material not being placed before the Sentencing Judge.
	
	
	I would reject this ground of appeal.
	


Conclusion


	
	I propose the following orders:
	


(1)   Grant leave to appeal.

(2)   Appeal dismissed.


	
	HAMILL J:   I agree with Davies J.

2703180,Murko v Greenfields Narellan Holdings trading as Narellan Town Centre [2015] NSWDC 132,"Judgment

Introduction


	
	The plaintiff brings proceedings for damages for personal injuries she sustained on 2 November 2010 as a result of stepping “on a spillage of a slippery substance” in the Narellan Shopping Mall (amended statement of claim, paragraph 13).
	
	
	The relevant particulars of negligence set out in the amended statement of claim (renumbered by me, for convenience) are as follows:
	



	
	Exposing the plaintiff to a risk of injury which could have been voided by reasonable care on its part (particular (c));
	
	
	Failing to provide a safe floor that was free of slippery substances (particular (d));
	
	
	Failing to clean, or to clean adequately, the said floor (particular (e));
	
	
	Permitting a slippery substance to remain on the floor particular (f));
	
	
	Failing to devise, institute and maintain a proper and safe system of spot checks of floors (particular (h));
	
	
	Failing to provide a safe means or system of cleaning the floor and draining the same thereby avoiding leaving slippery substances on the floor (particular (i));
	
	
	Failing, by its servants or agents, to observe that a quantity of slippery substance was on the floor (particular (n));
	
	
	Failing to more frequently and adequately inspect and clean the area around food retail outlets such as the take-away ice cream shop where this accident occurred, given the known propensity for those purchasing food and drink products to spill them in common walkway areas (particular (s);
	
	
	Failing to inspect the relevant area with no greater than 15 minute cycles by trained cleaners (particular (t));
	



	
	The remaining matters particularised related to the claim against the third and fourth defendants (who are no longer parties), or to failure to put down matting or erect a warning sign (issues not pursued at trial).
	
	
	I note Mr Lidden SC’s announcement, during closing submissions, that, in lieu of tendering expert evidence, there was an agreement between the parties that the coefficient of friction of the floor rendered the floor slippery if wet.
	


The issues


	
	Counsel for the first and second defendants identified the issues as follows:
	



	
	Did each of the first and second defendants (“the defendants”) owe the plaintiff a duty of care?
	
	
	What was the content of the duty?
	
	
	If the content of the duty required the implementation of a system for cleaning the floor of the Narellan Shopping Mall did the defendants’ cleaning system fail to discharge the duty?
	
	
	What was the source of the “slippery substance”?
	
	
	How long had “slippery substance” been on the floor?
	
	
	If the defendants are found to have breached their duty of care did that breach cause the fall? In other words, but for the breach would the fall would not have occurred?
	
	
	Did the plaintiff suffer anything more than de minimis injury from the fall?
	
	
	If so, did the defendants’ breach cause the plaintiff’s injury, disability, loss and damage?
	
	
	Was the plaintiff guilty of contributory negligence?
	
	
	What are the plaintiff’s entitlements to:
	



	
	Non-economic loss;
	
	
	Past and future out of pocket expenses;
	
	
	Past and future economic loss;
	
	
	Past and future superannuation; and/or
	
	
	Past and future domestic care and assistance.
	


The circumstances of the plaintiff’s accident


	
	The plaintiff, who was 38 weeks pregnant and booked in for a caesarean operation on the following day (3 November 2010), visited the shopping mall with her family on 2 November 2010. She intended to go to the bank in the shopping mall. To do so, she had to walk through a foodcourt-style area (although it was not the main food court of the shopping mall) containing about half a dozen cafes and take away outlets. It was lunch time, and the shopping mall was full of shoppers. Due to her advanced stage of pregnancy, she could not see her feet.
	
	
	At 1.49 p.m., the plaintiff walked past the counter of a take away ice-cream shop known as “Wendy’s”, one of the take-away food sellers and cafes in one section of the mall. While walking fairly close to the Wendy’s counter, her feet suddenly went from underneath her, and she landed fairly heavily on her right side:
	


“Q. Listen to my question. What happened to your feet?

A. My feet slid from underneath me.

Q. In which direction did you fall?

A. On my right‑hand side.

Q. Which bits of your body hit the ground first?

A. My right‑hand side, top of my leg, and maybe knee and hip.

Q. While you were there on the ground, did you notice anything about your clothing?

A. Yes. My knee and my right‑hand side, top - on my thigh was wet.

Q. What sort of clothing were you wearing at the time?

A. Three‑quarter pants, baggy pants.

Q. Before you slipped and fell, had you noticed anything on the floor?

A. No.

Q. After you slipped and fell, did you notice pain anywhere in your body?

A. Yes.

Q. Whereabouts?

A. On my back on the right‑hand side, my hip, and my groin on the right‑hand side.” (T 14)


	
	The fall, which is captured on CCTV footage (Exhibit 1), was witnessed by a Wendy’s employee, later named by the plaintiff as “Kate Burns” (see the plaintiff’s letter to the defendants’ insurance company dated April 2011, which is Exhibit A). The plaintiff’s mother and daughter came to where the plaintiff was standing after she got up from the fall. A security officer from the centre, Mr Habib, came over to assist, accompanied by a female employee:
	


“Q. After a time did any of your family arrive?

A. Yes.

Q. About how long did it take them to get there?

A. After I fell I called my daughter. Within a couple of minutes they were there.

Q. During that time did anyone do anything about cleaning up the floor?

A. No.

Q. In respect to the Wendys staff did you say anything to them about what had happened to you?

A. One of the Wendys staff members seen it happen.

Q. How do you know that?

A. Because she, she said “I seen it happen”.

Q. Did you see her making any phone calls or radio calls or anything of the sort?

A. Yes, she made a call and a security man came over and took - wrote down my details.” (T 15)


	
	The plaintiff went on to say:
	


“Q. What was the next thing that happened as to the arrival of people?

A. Another lady came over. The man left, another lady that seen it happen came over; another staff member from Wendys I think came over and then my daughter first, then my mother came over.

Q. How long did it take until your mother arrived, that is how long from the time of your fall until the arrival of your mother?

A. Approximately two minutes.

Q. During that time while the security guard was there did you see him make any - was it a male security guard?

A. A man yes.” (T 15)


	
	The security officer called on his radio for someone to come and mop up the spill and put up a sign:
	


“A. Yes, he called the cleaner.

Q. How long did it take the cleaner to arrive, from the time of your accident to the time that person arrived?

A. About four and a half minutes.

Q. That’s a pretty accurate estimate, why are you able to say it’s that period?

A. Well, well because mum came - mum and Taylor had already turned up and then when he did turn up my mum was yelling at him saying “How come you’re still standing there and you haven’t started cleaning”.

Q. So did the cleaner then do something?

A. Yes he started to clean the floor.

Q. What equipment if any did he have with him?

A. A mop and bucket.

Q. Did you notice the area that he cleaned?

A. Yes.

Q. How big was it?

A. At least a metre and a bit by a metre and a bit. It was quite a large area.” (T 16)


	
	According to the plaintiff’s account in Exhibit A, the lady who accompanied the security officer said she would report it, but that there were video cameras, so the incident would be recorded “as she had seen the whole fall” (Exhibit A). An objection was taken to the plaintiff giving evidence to this effect, but not to its repetition in this letter to the insurers, which records this conversation. Whether that was the case or not is irrelevant; the CCTV footage tendered, while taken from an unfortunate angle and somewhat indistinct, is corroborative evidence of what occurred.
	
	
	An incident report was filled out by the security guard in the plaintiff’s presence, but not given to her to check or sign:
	


“Q. While you were there you said that someone arrived to take your details, was any incident report form filled out?

A. Yes.

Q. Did you sign it?

A. No.

Q. What happened when the form was filled out, just tell me about it?

A. It was about this big by about that wide.

Q. You’re indicating about 30 centimetres high?

A. Yeah by about that wide.” (T 16)


	
	The security officer took the plaintiff’s details and offered to obtain an ambulance (T 16-17). The plaintiff refused because although she was in pain, she was more concerned to go home to check that she was not bleeding and that her baby was still moving (T 17).
	
	
	There is a considerable amount of independent evidence available to record the circumstances of this fall as well as the activities of the cleaners. As well as the CCTV for the mall for the period 1.15 pm to approximately 2.00 pm was produced on subpoena (produced on subpoena; an extract is set out in Exhibit 1), there were contemporaneous records by the security officer, a person named Ms Maria Correia and the cleaner. A call for the notes made by the security officer (who, according to Exhibit C, was a Mr Habib) was answered “not produced” (T 17). However, the reports of Ms Maria Correia of 16 November 2010 (Exhibit C) and Mr David Sharp of 6 June 2011 (Exhibit B), which had been sought on subpoena, were produced. Exhibit C not only sets out Ms Correia’s conversations with relevant people, but summarises the main points of Mr Habib’s report. I shall set these out in detail.
	


The defendants’ reports of the plaintiff’s accident


	
	A “Customer Incident Report Form”, on the letterhead of “Greenfields Development Corporation Ltd & D Vitocco Constructions t/as Narellan Town Centre”, a computer-generated document (Exhibit C), was completed by the first defendant’s employee, Maria Correia, on 16 November 2010.
	
	
	A Rusu objection (National Australia Bank v Rusu (1999) 47 NSWLR 309) was taken by the first and second defendants in relation to production of all its own documents, which had been provided under subpoena, of which this is the first. My reasons for admitting these documents into evidence are set out in more detail below.
	
	
	The first and second defendants did not call any oral evidence. In those circumstances, the relevant portions of Maria Correia’s report should be set out in full. The plaintiff’s details are provided and, in the section marked “restrictions”, the word “pregnant” is typed. The incident is then described as follows:
	


“2. THE INCIDENT

Location

Centre Court near Wendys

Date and Time of incident

2.11.10, approx 1.45pm

Day of the week

Tuesday

Reported by

Wendy’s Staff member called Centre Management and Kathryn contacted security via two way radio, ‘Security Habib’ answered to the call.

3. THE INJURY

Injured person’s version of events

Secutrity [sic] Habib has advised and noted in his report that when he attended the incident area, Mrs Murco [sic] was crying and said that she was in pain. She told Habib that she had slipped. Habib did a site inspection and found that there was a small water spill on the floor.

Habib noticed that she was pregnant and offered to contact an ambulance or take her to the medical centre but both offers were refused.

She informed Habib that she had pain coming from her inner thighs. Habib offered again to get her medical assistance by someone authorised but the offer was again declined. She advised that she was scheduled to have her baby the following day and if the pain got any worse then she would have it checked out.

Habib took her details and advised that a report would be done. At this stage, Mrs Murcos [sic] mother showed up and assisted her back to her car. Security Habib went with them to make sure that she got there safe with no problems.

9. FOLLOW UP CALL TO CUSTOMER

Date & Time

16th November 2010 at approximately 9:30am

By whom

Maria Correia

File notes on conversation

Nicole advised that she still has pains between her thighs which goes down to her knees and through her legs.

She described it as a shooting pain. She said that she was glad to have been booked in to have a caesarean the next day because labour could have been difficult due to the pains she was experiencing.

She queried what happens now several times as she was still in pain, She suspected that it could have been muscle damage. I had informed her that a report had been done by security and I would also be completing one myself to send through. I suggested an additional follow up call to see how she was, she said that would be good and we scheduled in next Tuesday the 23rd November.”


	
	No documents were tendered by either side in relation to the “follow up call” to see how the plaintiff was. However, it is not in dispute that Chubb Insurance authorised, and paid for, physiotherapy for the plaintiff for the period from March 28 2011 up to January 2012.
	
	
	A report was prepared by the cleaner, Mr David Sharp, on a date described as “06/06/11” (Exhibit B). He described the incident as follows:
	


“As I patrolled stage one that includes Wendy’s area, was all clear of any spillages & litter. Continued patrol around entries than into corridore [sic] than toilets. I came out of the toilet’s corridore [sic] and saw that a lady had sliped [sic] & fell [sic] on milky type fluid. Caution sign was placed and floor was cleaned & mop dried [sic].”


	
	The plaintiff’s account of the accident was also recorded in her letter of April 2011 to Marissa Brenton, the Claims Officer of Chubb Insurance (Exhibit A), as part of the plaintiff’s request for physiotherapy. In it, the plaintiff records that while “on my way to the bank I slipped over on some water or something outside Wendy’s. There was no sign to say there was a spill or anything like that”. She said that first a man and then a lady came to see if she was all right, and that a security guard and then the plaintiff’s mother and daughter came to the scene. She noted that the mall representatives who came “called on their radio for someone to come and mop up the spill and put up a sign”. This letter also notes that the security guard asked for her details and offered to call an ambulance.
	
	
	Given the similarity of these versions of events, and the confirmation of the CCTV footage, many of the uncertainties of slip and fall accidents, such as the precise location, the mechanics of the fall, and the presence of shopping centre employees recording the events, should not be disputed issues of substance in these proceedings. The defendants called no evidence to contradict the plaintiff’s account of her fall. The defendants did, however, challenge the admissibility of their own records, and I set out below my reasons for allowing them into evidence.
	


Objections to the tender of reports of the accident by the first and second defendants


	
	The defendants take a Rusu objection (National Australia Bank v Rusu (1999) 47 NSWLR 309) to the tender of their own documents, produced from Packet 2 of documents forwarded to the subpoena registry in response to a subpoena. Regrettably, this packet is missing, and the documents tendered are the plaintiff’s solicitors’ copies.
	
	
	Mr Sleight submitted that the warnings of Bryson J in Rusu at [28] mean that the production of documents obtained under subpoena, even from his own client, could not, without more, demonstrate them to be authentic, and that the maker of the document had to be called. That means that the plaintiff has to find and subpoena Mr Habib and Ms Correia, neither of whom, Mr Sleight submitted, should be regarded as employees of either of the defendants merely because their names appeared on the documents produced under subpoena.
	
	
	The defendants were under an obligation to produce the documents sought under subpoena, namely the reports of the persons who attended for the purpose of noting down the plaintiff’s details and the reports that they prepared. Does that mean that, by production of the documents, they waive objections to authenticity? Is authenticity in fact a prerequisite for admissibility of a document (ACCC v Air New Zealand Ltd (No 2) [2012] FCA 1355 at [92]-[93])? If Rusu is applied (and I accept, for the purpose of argument, the submission that these documents are not business records as they were prepared in anticipation of litigation), can the court dispense with the requirement that these witnesses be called if there is something more than mere tender of the documents to show their authenticity (ASIC v Rich (2005) 216 ALR 320 at [119])?
	
	
	First, unlike the bank records in Rusu, these documents are complete in themselves and the information within them confirms their authenticity. The name of the form and of the shopping centre are set out at the top of Exhibit C. Exhibit D is headed “Customer Incident Report for: Hysense Cleaning Pty Ltd” and the section “Our version of events” is signed and dated by David Sharp. The form’s questions contain handwritten answers stating that the incident is the accident of Nicole Murko, the location and date of the accident, that the CCTV was retained, and that the site was inspected by Ash Halam. While Mr Sleight submitted that certain notations (“dust related cleaning to be attended” and “no risk at time of inspection”) were not clear in meaning, that uncertainty in wording should not prevent these documents from being tendered. (I note Mr Sleight’s Rusu objection to Exhibit D was made and then but then withdrawn, as he intended to call Mr Sharp (T 116). However, he did not call Mr Sharp, and I have assumed he has reinvoked his right to this ruling.)
	
	
	One of the objections to Exhibit C is that this document records the finding by Mr Habib that there was “a small water spill on the floor” and that “A cleaner was contacted by Habib to clean the spill”. It also stated that Mr Habib “has advised and noted in his report” the above matters, and that he “took her details and advised a report would be done”. This report was not produced in answer to a call (T 16) and Mr Sleight objected to the summarising of its contents by another person. I reject that objection, as it is clear from Ms Correia’s report that she is summarising from a document before her, and not from some unknown hearsay account.
	
	
	Mr Sleight’s also objected on the basis that Exhibit C was “not signed by anyone, it could be the first draft, it could be the last draft” (T 146). Additionally, it did not “look like” a business record. Given the circumstances of its preparation, I am prepared to accept it was prepared in circumstances of anticipation of possible litigation. However, it was not signed because it was a computer record, and the absence of a signature is irrelevant.
	
	
	I am satisfied that, on the face of these documents, they are authentic, and I additionally rely upon all of the factors listed by J Forrest J in Matthews v SPI Electricity Pty Ltd (Ruling No 35) [2014] VSC 59 at [32] to permit the tender of such documents in circumstances where a Rusu-style objection is made.
	
	
	My rulings are based on an approach of caution. Rusu is a controversial decisions, and one which has received almost no appellate consideration. The only appellate decision to refer to Rusu since the enactment of the Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW) is Trimcoll Pty Ltd v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [2007] NSWCA 307 where Basten JA (at [30]) notes the three requirements of “authenticity, identity and admissibility”, citing Rusu without comment. With the passage of time, and the enactment of ss 56-62 Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW), the correctness of Bryson J’s approach in Rusu has been questioned, as Schmidt J noted in Attorney-General (NSW) v Markisic [2014] NSWSC 1596 at [106]-[108]:
	


“[106] It should also be noted, however, that the correctness of Bryson J’s approach in Rusu has since been questioned. In the Matter of Maiden Civil Pty Ltd [2012] NSWSC 1618, Brereton J considered the decision and the cases which later considered it, concluding at [23]:

“As in other cases in which a Rusu objection has recently been taken before me, so in this, Needham J’s judgment in Marra Developments has been in the back of my mind, and I have used this opportunity to consult it more fully in the light of Rusu. In my view, the position shortly stated is, first, that the mere production of a document cannot authenticate it; secondly, Marra establishes, although Rusu might contradict, that production on subpoena from an identified source might suffice to show that it is produced from the custody of the entity whose business it is, which would facilitate an inference that it was a business record; and thirdly, Rusu should not to be taken to limit the way in which authenticity of a document can be proven. For my part, I would respectfully doubt whether production on subpoena by the entity whose business the document is alleged to be a record of would always be insufficient to found the requisite inference; however, Rusu has been endorsed, subject to the minor qualification of the words, “save in limited circumstances” in the Court of Appeal and by Austin J in this Division, and on that basis, I should follow it.”

[107] In this case those observations apply to those of the disputed documents obtained either from court files on Ms Kavanagh’s request and those obtained from Crown Solicitor’s files.

[108] In Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Air New Zealand [2012] FCA 1355; (2012) 207 FCR 448, Perram J also considered the authorities which had questioned Rusu and declined to follow it, taking the view that its approval in Daw v Toyworld (NSW) Pty Ltd was obiter (see at [92]–[104]). His Honour there discussed the distinction between admissibility of evidence, a question of law and authenticity of documents, a question of fact. He considered that a document the authenticity of which was in issue could be relevant and admissible under ss 55 and 56 of the Evidence Act, with its authenticity being a question of fact in issue which had to be determined on all of the evidence in the proceedings. His Honour gave examples of such cases, including forgery prosecutions and contests over whether a signature on a Will was genuine.”


	
	The point in Daw v Toyworld (NSW) Pty Ltd [2001] NSWCA 25 was that no objection was taken at the trial to the authenticity of the document, as J Forrest J, in Matthews v SPI Electricity Pty Ltd (Ruling No 35), notes. Perhaps that is why LexisNexis has a warning sign besides its report of Rusu, with the note “cautionary treatment indicated”.
	
	
	Thanks to the widespread use of electronically stored information, authenticity of documents has largely ceased to be a problem on the fifteen years which have passed since Rusu. Additionally, the strictures on documents produced on subpoena in commercial litigation need to be read in light of the availability of discovery of the parties’ documents, a process not available in personal injury proceedings.
	
	
	I also note, in passing, that the general unavailability of discovery in personal injury proceedings, which requires the parties to obtain documents from each other and from third parties on subpoena, creates real injustice, of which the above is but one example. It also creates problems for courts; the subpoena packet containing these documents could not be located, and if the plaintiff’s solicitors had not made copies when they inspected, these documents would not have been available at all.
	
	
	In my view, it is time that obligations of all parties to produce documents in personal injury litigation was reconsidered in the light of modern litigation practices, including the desirability of both parties producing to each other, early in the litigation, documents of obvious relevance such as these.
	


Findings of fact


	
	Noting the considerable amount of evidence as to the circumstances of the plaintiff’s fall, what findings of fact are necessary in order to determine the issues identified by the defendants?
	


Duty of care


	
	The first two questions on the defendants’ list of issues poses the question whether a duty of care was owed at all and if so, what the content of that duty of care would be.
	
	
	The amended statement of claim pleads that the first defendant was the occupier of, and had the care, control and management of, the shopping mall and that the second defendant conducted the business of commercial cleaning at those premises pursuant to a contract with the first defendant which included provisions, inter alia, for the common areas of the premises to be kept clean and safe. Both the first and second defendants admit these allegations (paragraphs 2 of their respective defences filed on 31 March and 1 April 2014). Do the defendants owe different duties of care? In Jackson v McDonald's Australia Ltd [2014] NSWCA 162 at [7]-[8], the Court of Appeal noted:
	


“[7] It was common ground that McDonald’s owed the appellant a duty to take reasonable care to avoid a foreseeable risk of injury to him arising from the physical state of its land, on the assumption that he used reasonable care for his safety: Australian Safeways Stores Pty Ltd v Zaluzna [1987] HCA 7; (1987) 162 CLR 479 (at 488) per Mason, Wilson, Deane and Dawson JJ; Roads & Traffic Authorities (NSW) v Dederer [2007] HCA 42; (2007) 234 CLR 334 (at [45]) per Gummow J. The appellant submitted that Holistic’s duty was relevantly identical with McDonald’s, a proposition Holistic did not dispute insofar at least as liability to the appellant was concerned.

[8] Gleeson JA (with whom Emmett JA and Tobias AJA agreed) addressed the content of the assumption that an entrant uses reasonable care for his or her safety in his pellucid judgment in Reid v Commercial Club (Albury) Ltd [2014] NSWCA 98 (at [159]) as follows:

[159] The scope of the occupier’s duty of care is marked out by the relationship between the occupier and users exercising reasonable care for their own safety. Thus, “the weight to be given to an expectation that potential plaintiffs will exercise reasonable care for their own safety is a general matter in the assessment of breach in every case”: Roads and Traffic Authority of New South Wales v Dederer and Another [2007] HCA 42; 234 CLR 330 at [45] (Dederer). This involves a factual judgment which may depend on the circumstances of the case: Thompson v Woolworths (Q’land) Pty Ltd [2005] HCA 19; 221 CLR 234 at [35].”


	
	In Jackson v McDonald's Australia Ltd, as was the case here, duty of care was admitted in the pleadings and not the subject of submissions. The Court of Appeal was critical of the approach taken at first instance in relation to identifying the duty of care and emphasised the need for the risk of harm to be precisely identified. In Jackson v McDonald's Australia Ltd, a description of the risk of harm as being that the plaintiff might slip was rejected as insufficient (at [17]); the primary judge is required to identify accurately the actual risk of injury the plaintiff faces, as it is only through correct identification of the risk that the court can determine what a reasonable response to that risk would be: Roads and Traffic Authority of New South Wales v Dederer (2007) 234 CLR 330 at [7]. No submission was made in these proceedings that the duties of care owed by the respective defendants were any different to those of the defendants in Jackson v McDonald's Australia Ltd, and in those circumstances I propose to regard those duties as “identical” (Jackson v McDonald's Australia Ltd at [7]).
	
	
	The correct approach to the content of the assumption that an entrant uses reasonable care for his or her safety is explained by Gleeson JA in Reid v Commercial Club (Albury) Ltd [2014] NSWCA 98 at [159], that foreseeability of risk of injury is not determinative of breach of duty of care (Francis v Lewis [2003] NSWCA 152 at [40]), that the occupier’s obligation is not to make the premises as safe as reasonable care and skill can make them (in that it is not an insurer of entrants) and that what constitutes the exercise of reasonable care will depend upon the circumstances of each case: Wilkinson v Law Courts Ltd [2001] NSWCA 196 at [32].
	
	
	The defendants submit (similarly to the defendant’s submissions in Strong v Woolworths Ltd t/as Big W (2012) 246 CLR 182 at [31]) firstly, that that the contents of the duty of care owed by the defendants, and in particular by the second defendant, cannot be determined by reference to the contractual obligations between the parties, in that failure to discharge those obligations by leaving the area unpatrolled for a period of time in excess of the 15 minute period required by that contract cannot constitute a breach of duty of care “on the present evidence” (written submissions, paragraph 20). Mr Sleight relies upon Arabi v Glad Cleaning Service Pty Ltd [2010] NSWCA 208 to submit that the contractual arrangements “may” justify an inference that the contractual requirements represent the appropriate precautions, but submits that a “significant departure” from this contractual situation would be required before a finding of negligence could be made. This brings me to the question of what the plaintiff must establish in order to demonstrate a breach of those “identical” duties by the defendants.
	
	
	In Woolworths Ltd v Strong [2010] NSWCA 282 at [60], the Court of Appeal considered that Woolworths’ negligent failure to implement a system of periodic inspection would be a necessary condition of the appellant’s harm. There was no evidence of cleaning for the whole period of time from the opening of the store up until the accident. The issue before the High Court was whether the Court of Appeal was right to conclude that it was not open on the evidence to apply that reasoning in this case, principally because the contaminant on the floor in that case, namely a hot chip, was most likely to have been deposited at lunch time.
	
	
	The High Court in Strong v Woolworths Ltd t/as Big W defined the issue in those proceedings as follows (at [32]-[33]):
	


“[32] The appellant was required to prove on the balance of probabilities that Woolworths’ negligence was a necessary condition of her harm. Woolworths’ negligence lay in its failure to employ a system for the periodic inspection and cleaning of the sidewalk sales area. Proof of the causal link between an omission and an occurrence requires consideration of the probable course of events had the omission not occurred. Here, the appellant was required to prove that, had a system of periodic inspection and cleaning of the sidewalk sales area been employed on the day of her fall, it is likely that the chip would have been detected and removed before she approached the entrance to Big W.

[33] The sidewalk sales area was not inspected in the four and a half hours between the time when the area was set up for the day’s trading and the time of the appellant’s fall. There was no dispute that, had the area been inspected, the chip would have been detected and removed. The Court of Appeal observed that the chip was not lying at the very edge of the corridor, given that Ms Hurst was walking next to the appellant on her right, and noted the evidence that it was visible after the appellant’s fall.”


	
	Mr Sleight submits that for the plaintiff to establish liability (s 5B(1)(c)), she must first establish what frequency rotation a reasonable person in the position of the first and second defendants would take as a precaution. In Woolworths Ltd v Strong, where the contract stipulated 15 minutes (see [7]), reasonable care nevertheless required inspection and removal of the slipping hazards at a greater interval, namely “not greater than 20 minutes”. Clearly, in those circumstances, even though the contract required cleaning every 15 minutes with “an exceptionally high standard of cleaning with special attention paid to the food court/public seating areas” (Client Terms and Conditions, paragraph f), the contractual terms are not determinative either of the content of duty of care or breach of that duty.
	


Factual findings necessary in relation to breach of duty and causation


	
	Before considering issues of breach of duty, it is first necessary to establish two issues:
	



	
	What the plaintiff slipped on; and,
	
	
	What cleaning system was put in place by the defendants.
	


What did the plaintiff slip on, and where was it?


	
	The questions of what the plaintiff slipped on, and its visibility, need to take into account that the plaintiff’s very heavily pregnant state meant that she could not see her feet and thus the floor. The plaintiff herself was unaware of what she had slipped on. In her April 2011 letter to Marissa Brenton, the claims officer for Chubb Insurance, she describes it as “some water or something outside Wendys”. She went on to note, “there was no sign to say that there was a spill or anything like that”. The statement of claim identifies only “a spillage of a slippery substance”. The CCTV footage shows the plaintiff falling, but does not identify the substance. The defendants’ own records are more helpful. As noted above, security staff member, Mr Habib, advised Mrs Correia that he had seen what he called “a small water spill on the floor”. As also noted above, the cleaner said that when he came out of the toilet corridor, he “saw that a lady had sliped [sic] and fell [sic] on milky type fluid”. The plaintiff’s daughter gave similar evidence of observing a milky type fluid on the floor similarly to that of a milkshake. However, how did it get there, and how long had it been there?
	


The defendants’ “ice cream boy” argument


	
	Mr Sleight, relying on his own observations of the CCTV, put to the court that the contaminant in question was a ball of ice cream dropped by a young boy six seconds prior to the plaintiff’s fall, in circumstances where no cleaning system could have played any part in the plaintiff’s accident.
	
	
	The CCTV does not actually show a small boy dropping ice cream. It is surmise. A woman and small boy are seen at Wendy’s some six minutes earlier (Exhibit 2, pp 4-5), and the small boy walks away with the woman, holding an ice cream ball in a cone in his hand. When the boy comes back into view on the CCTV, walking behind his mother (Exhibit 2 pp 6-7), six seconds before the plaintiff’s accident, he passes relatively close by the place of the fall. He appears to slow down before speeding up to follow his mother.
	
	
	Nothing can be seen to drop, or even to be missing, but Mr Sleight postulates that the ball of ice cream must have fallen, and the plaintiff slipped on it. No cleaning system could effectively deal with a ball of ice cream dropping six seconds before the next person’s fall, and there is thus no breach of duty of care or liability for the harm caused by the plaintiff.
	
	
	The difficulties with this submission are as follows:
	



	
	The path of the boy carrying the ice cream and the path of the plaintiff do not intersect. Mr Lidden SC has helpfully tendered a diagram showing the respective paths of the little boy and the plaintiff. The little boy is not within sufficient distance of the plaintiff so as to have dropped his ice cream from his ice cream cone in her path.
	
	
	A ball of ice cream is inconsistent with the description of the spillage by all persons present. While descriptions as to the milky nature of the substance vary from water to a milky substance, there is no description resembling the fall of even a partially melted ball of ice cream (for the ice cream to have been capable of remaining on the cone until six seconds before the plaintiff’s fall, it must still have retained some of its ball-like shape). The plaintiff’s daughter was certain she had not seen any shape resembling a ball of ice cream or indeed ice cream. Mr Sleight’s submission that the ball of ice cream might have been kicked away in the plaintiff’s fall is inconsistent with the description by the cleaner and by that of the security guard of the spillage (as noted by Ms Correia), as well as implausible.
	
	
	There is nothing visible on the CCTV to suggest that the child did in fact drop the ice cream. Mr Sleight and Mr Lidden SC both warned each other (and myself) against making assumptions as to such imponderables as the likelihood of the child not consuming the ice cream in the six minutes, or of how much ice cream ball tension is necessary for it to remain on the cone, or the most likely response of a small child who has dropped his ice cream. All this does is to heighten the implausibility of the scenario.
	



	
	I am satisfied, having regard to the consistency of the description given by all of those persons present, that the slippery substance was a reasonably large pool of liquid, not a ball of ice cream, which slippery substance had been there for sufficiently long to spread or liquefy to the form described by those who saw it. There was no ball of ice cream and the boy seen carrying the ice cream away six minutes earlier played no part in these events on his return. I am comforted in this finding by the fact that Mr Sharp, the cleaner, was available to be called and was not called (Jones v Dunkel (1959) 101 CLR 298).
	


The cleaning system


	
	This brings me to the question of the cleaning system. As Ms Correia’s report (Exhibit C) demonstrates, CCTV was retained. The CCTV available to the court commences at approximately 1:15pm and concludes at approximately 2:00pm. The plaintiff was not cross-examined about her claim that the cleaners were called to the site of the accident by the security guard. This means that their presence to mop up the contaminant was not as a result of the cleaning system, but as a result of a direct request (contrary to Exhibit D).
	
	
	The CCTV shows the cleaners walking along a corridor in the shopping centre which was at right angles to the path where the plaintiff fell for the periods 1:31:23 to 1:31:38, and returning along the same path at 1:32:29. The cleaner is seen to use a device to pick up an item at 1:32.29 (Exhibit 4, p 8). While it is difficult to tell from the CCTV, the cleaner appears to be looking at the floor ahead and not to turn his head to look down the aisle where the accident occurs. He does not go down that aisle at all.
	
	
	In Woolworths Ltd v Strong, it was not in question that, on the day of the plaintiff’s fall, Woolworths did not have any system in place for the periodic inspection and cleaning of the sales area (at [3]). The system was described (at [6]-[9]) as being that the area was cleaned “every 20 minutes” intervals, but for the area in question, there was no system of inspection in place for the entire 4.5 hour period from the time of opening of the store.
	
	
	What is the evidence of cleaning in the Narellan shopping centre on the day that these events occurred? Between 1:15 pm, when the footage commences, to the walk-by of the cleaner at 1:31 to 1:32 pm, no cleaning activities are shown. Mr Sleight concedes that this amounts to leaving the area unpatrolled for some 17 minutes (written submissions, p 20).
	
	
	However, Mr Lidden SC submits that the period is far longer, in that it was open to the defendants to lead evidence of the cleaning activities in this area, whether by CCTV or by oral evidence from the cleaner, Mr Sharp, as to when the corridor in which the plaintiff slipped had last been clean. No such evidence is available and Mr Lidden SC invites me to accept his submission that, as was the case in Strong v Woolworths, there is no evidence of cleaning on the morning of these events at all. In this regard, Mr Lidden SC appears to be referring to evidence of the kind discussed, for example, in Alat v Franklins Pty Ltd (2012) 15 DCLR (NSW) 203 at [45], where the defendant did not put into evidence daily floor inspection logs, or call any evidence as to what the system of cleaning actually was on the day in question.
	
	
	Any such evidence would have been relevant to the issue of causation. In explaining the relationship of evidence to causation for the purposes of s 5D, the High Court in Strong v Woolworths Ltd outlined this issue at [20]:
	


“Under the statute, factual causation requires proof that the defendant's negligence was a necessary condition of the occurrence of the particular harm. A necessary condition is a condition that must be present for the occurrence of the harm. However, there may be more than one set of conditions necessary for the occurrence of particular harm and it follows that a defendant's negligent act or omission which is necessary to complete a set of conditions that are jointly sufficient to account for the occurrence of the harm will meet the test of factual causation within s 5D(1)(a). In such a case, the defendant's conduct may be described as contributing to the occurrence of the harm. This is pertinent to the appellant's attack on the court of Appeal's reasons, which is directed to para 48 of the judgment:

Now, apart from the 'exceptional case' that s 5D(2) recognises, s 5D(1) sets out what must be established to conclude that negligence caused particular harm. That emerges from the words 'comprises the following elements' in the chapeau to s 5D(1). 'Material contribution', and notions of increase in risk, have no role to play in s 5D(1). It well may be that many actions or omissions that the common law would have recognised as making a material contribution to the harm that a plaintiff suffered will fall within s 5D(1), but that does not alter the fact that the concepts of material contribution and increase in risk have no role to play in deciding whether s 5D(1) is satisfied in any particular case."" (emphasis in original)""


	
	The court explained the onus of proof as to causation at [32]:
	


“The appellant was required to prove on the balance of probabilities that Woolworths' negligence was a necessary condition of her harm. Woolworths' negligence lay in its failure to employ a system for the periodic inspection and cleaning of the sidewalk sales area. Proof of the causal link between an omission and an occurrence requires consideration of the probable course of events had the omission not occurred. Here, the appellant was required to prove that, had a system of periodic inspection and cleaning of the sidewalk sales area been employed on the day of her fall, it is likely that the chip would have been detected and removed before she approached the entrance to Big W.”


	
	Mr Lidden SC submits that the plaintiff has proved, on the balance of probabilities, that there was no or no sufficient system of periodic inspection in that the sole evidence of cleaning was the cleaner seen walking forward and back along the adjoining aisle, particularly at 1.32 pm.
	
	
	Mr Sleight submits it is more likely than not that the cleaner, when doing so, would have seen a contaminant of the size and nature described by the plaintiff’s daughter and cleaned it up (written submissions, p 30) at 1:32pm if it was there. This would mean that the contaminant was not on the floor at 1.32 pm and thus not discoverable before the plaintiff’s accident at 1.49 pm. However, Mr Lidden SC submits, and I agree, that there is no evidence from the CCTV that the cleaner was inspecting, or even looking at, the site of the spilled material. He certainly did not go into the aisle in front of Wendy’s. It is unclear, from the CCTV, just how far down the aisle the cleaner could have seen. I also accept Mr Lidden SC’s submissions as to the inference I should draw in relation to the defendants’ failure to call the cleaner, Mr Sharp.
	
	
	Finally, Mr Sleight submits that the 50 or so people who are seen in the CCTV to walk along the corridor where the plaintiff slipped do not appear to have any difficulty, in that none of them slipped on the contaminant. Most of those persons, however, are walking in the middle of the corridor, whereas the site of the contaminant is closer to the Wendy’s takeaway shop. One lady does stop a pram in an area very close to the site, but the stability of a four-wheel pram is not the same as that of a 38-week pregnant woman. The significance of the plaintiff’s pregnancy is that, like the plaintiff in Strong v Woolworths Ltd (who was walking through Woolworths on crutches because one leg had been amputated above the knee), her mobility and ability to see the floor were considerably less than that of other users of the walkway.
	
	
	When determining breach of duty and causation issues, careful attention must always be paid to the facts of the case. The plaintiff in these proceedings was particularly vulnerable to slip hazards because of her mobility problems. She was not in a position to perceive a liquid substance spilled on the floor. According, when considering these issues, some regard should be had to the particular vulnerability of a woman in her advanced stage of pregnancy. The facts in relation to causation also closely resemble those of Strong v Woolworths Ltd in this regard.
	


Conclusions concerning liability


	
	The plaintiff’s accident occurred in a busy shopping mall at lunch time, in an area requiring special vigilance because of the number of shops selling food. Slipping accidents in supermarkets or shopping centres represent a well-known risk, requiring regular inspections of particular places of danger at regular and short intervals: Brady v Girvan Bros Pty Ltd (1986) 7 NSWLR 241 at 256.
	
	
	Determination of the appropriate frequency of any cleaning and inspection system in relation to this part of the shopping mall requires careful analysis of the relevant provisions of s 5B Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW), which provides:
	


“(1) A person is not negligent in failing to take precautions against a risk of harm unless:

(a) the risk was foreseeable (that is, it is a risk of which the person knew or ought to have known), and

(b) the risk was not insignificant, and

(c) in the circumstances, a reasonable person in the person’s position would have taken those precautions.

(2) In determining whether a reasonable person would have taken precautions against a risk of harm, the court is to consider the following (amongst other relevant things):

(a) the probability that the harm would occur if care were not taken,

(b) the likely seriousness of the harm,

(c) the burden of taking precautions to avoid the risk of harm,

(d) the social utility of the activity that creates the risk of harm.”


	
	I am satisfied, in relation to s 5B(1), that the risk was foreseeable and not insignificant. This brings me to the question of what precautions a reasonable person in the defendants’ position would have taken. This is determined by considering the matters set out in s 5B(2) and having regard to, inter alia, apparent departures from the system referred to in the contract (see Strong v Woolworths Ltd at [8]).
	
	
	Taking all of the above into account, I am satisfied that in a food court type area such as the premises where the accident occurred, in an aisle thronged with lunch time shoppers and where the sale of liquid items was occurring, a reasonable person would have instituted a system of cleaning and inspection not only with a minimum frequency of every 15 minutes, but which would have included walking along areas of the kind likely to require “special attention” in accordance with the terms set out in the contract (Exhibit F). The contract stipulates food court shops as requiring special attention because shops selling food such as take-away ice cream, milkshakes and other liquid refreshments are prone to be handing over goods likely to drip from their containers. The aisle in question represented a higher risk than that considered in Strong v Woolworths Ltd for this reason.
	
	
	The likelihood of harm (s 5B(2)) is significant and the probability that harm would occur without such a system is significant. The burden of taking such precautions was very low; the terms of the contract were clear and it was in the interests of both defendants that they should be complied with. The sale of iced liquid and/or water based take-away products come with attendant risks, of which both defendants would have been well aware.
	
	
	Mr Sleight submits that it is necessary for me to make a finding that there was a significant departure from the standards necessary to keep such an area free of spillage (including any reference to contractual obligations), and submits that this is the “20 minute” test identified in Strong v Woolworths. I do not accept that Strong v Woolworths should be read as determining that 20 minutes would be sufficient. Each case must turn on its own facts; the reference to 20 minutes in Strong v Woolworths needs to be seen in the context of the relevant area being outside the store, and not inside a food consumption area in an aisle selling liquid take-away products, in circumstances where there was a need for “special attention” (Exhibit F) cleaning in the food areas. (I also note the reference in Strong v Woolworths to there being “no explanation” as to the difference between 15 minutes in the contract and the 20 minute system (at [8]); the court dealt with the facts on the basis of the 20 minute system, but did not conclude that 15 minutes was surplus to requirements.)
	
	
	I am satisfied that the spillage occurred more than 15 minutes prior to the plaintiff’s accident, in circumstances where a reasonable system required an inspection every 15 minutes, with “special attention” (Exhibit F) to the food court and public seating areas, and where, on the CCTV evidence, I am satisfied that no inspection took place from at least 1.15 p.m. and indeed for an unknown but considerably longer period prior to that. The speedy response of both defendants to the fall indicates that both defendants had servants or agents in the vicinity who could, and should, have been on the lookout both for spillages of this sort and for failures to comply with the cleaning system.
	
	
	The plaintiff has therefore established causation and, as a result, her case in negligence against both defendants.
	


Contributory negligence


	
	In the course of closing submissions, the defendants abandoned their claim of contributory negligence.
	


Quantum


	
	The relevant issues for consideration are:
	



	
	The plaintiff’s relevant pre-accident history;
	
	
	The plaintiff’s injuries, treatment and the medical evidence;
	
	
	The damages sought and medical causation issues.
	



	
	The plaintiff’s pre-accident history is one of continuous employment and excellent health. Born in 1971, she completed her secondary studies (Year 12) in 1989 and commenced a secretarial course in 1990. She worked continuously, first as a data entry processor and then in the accounts department of one company and then as a receptionist in a second company, She worked as a receptionist and head cashier at another firm shortly before the birth of her first daughter, Taylor, being made a part time employee after her daughter’s birth. Her second daughter, Chelsea, was born in 2000, but she continued part time employment at Campbell's Cash & Carry until 2003, when she commenced the first of her two jobs as a finance broker at Capital Corp in 2003.
	
	
	In 2004 the plaintiff and her husband (who had married in 1994) were divorced. She worked part time at United Financial Services (for 28 to 30 hours per week) for 18 months and then set up her own company, Harrington Park Financial Services, as a finance broker providing car loans. She worked full time in this company up until the birth of her third child, Ellie-May, who was born on 3 November 2010, the day after the plaintiff’s accident. She had married the child’s father, Andrew Murko, on 6 March 2010, and his younger son Mitchell was living with the family at the time of the accident.
	
	
	The plaintiff’s cross-examination commenced with challenges to her accreditation as a finance broker (T 53-56). This was a mistake on the part of the defendants. As the plaintiff had obtained her licence while married to her first husband, her licence was in her married name at the time. The plaintiff herself realised this error and pointed it out to Mr Sleight (T 55-56). I was impressed by the way the plaintiff frankly and fairly answered the somewhat confronting questions on her alleged lack of qualifications. Her demeanour in the witness box generally was that of an intelligent, observant and honest witness who was doing her best to answer the questions. At times she appears to anticipate the question but, given the circumstances in which the cross-examination commenced with an egregious error by Mr Sleight in relation to the plaintiff’s qualifications, I consider this to be understandable.
	
	
	The plaintiff described her work methods in the business she was running at the time of the accident. Essentially, she had based her business technics on what she had learned while working for Capital Corp and United Financial Services. She drove to the car dealers, indulged in what she called “chit chats” with them and generally put her business forward as a desirable one to broker loans for persons buying motor vehicles. The tax returns for the company business indicate the degree of success the plaintiff had. Prior to the accident, she had employed another worker for 20 hours a week. Her intention was to continue working in this business (since she could work from home using her computer and telephone), as an important part of maintaining her business was ongoing contacts with her regular customers.
	
	
	The plaintiff’s health before the accident was excellent. Apart from an operation in 1992 to remove an abscess, her sole illness of significance was a pelvic sling operation in 2009 to correct problems which had resulted from the birth of her two daughters. Importantly, as Dr Teoh notes in his report of 10 April 2014 (Exhibit K, page 2), there is no past history of psychiatric illness, no family history of childhood trauma or abuse, or any other indicia of pre-existing problems. The plaintiff’s history of treatment since the accident is set out in the letters from Dr Burhan to the plaintiff’s general practitioner as well as in the reports of Mr Glancey (Exhibit K).
	
	
	I note in this regard that the expert psychiatrist report from Dr Lewin, for the defendants, was withdrawn from tender shortly after the hearing commenced, which meant that the plaintiff (who had not re-served it) could not tender this document. I have the benefit of some extracts from his report in the report of Mr Glancey of 20 April 2015 (Exhibit K), to which no objection has been taken by the defendants. Those extracts do not appear to include any information from Dr Lewin about the plaintiff’s pre-accident history but it appears to be generally accepted, given Mr Glancey’s comments about the similar views he and Dr Lewin hold, that the plaintiff has no prior psychiatric history of any kind.
	
	
	All of the medical reports thus point to the plaintiff enjoying excellent health prior to the accident. This is relevant when considering the significant change in the plaintiff’s work life, personal life and health following her fall on 2 November 2010.
	


The plaintiff’s medical treatment and business activities following the accident


	
	The plaintiff’s medical history following the accident needs to be seen in the context of her intended admission for a caesarean operation the day after the accident (3 November 2010). She was released from hospital the following day. She told the court (see also Exhibit A) that she asked to be allowed to go home early because of back pain.
	
	
	The plaintiff was then at home breastfeeding her baby, and told the court she was reluctant to take pain medication for that reason. Additionally, she was recovering from significant surgery; for example, she had been told not to drive for six weeks. While the plaintiff agreed that she could have asked her husband to drive her to the doctor if she wanted medical assistance, I accept her evidence that she thought her back pain would get better with time, and that this was why, when she did see her doctor about other matters in November 2010, she did not mention back pain. She did, however, consult her general practitioner about other problems over this period, as is set out in more detail below.
	
	
	The plaintiff did not seek medical advice about her back and leg pains until 2 March 2011, when she saw her general practitioner. She commenced physiotherapy on 28 March 2011 with a physiotherapist, Rachael Wiltshire.
	
	
	Between, or shortly after, her first two physiotherapy, the plaintiff then wrote to Chubb Insurance Company of Australia Ltd (“Chubb Insurance”) in early April 2012, outlining her physical condition as follows:
	


“My daughter was safely delivered via c-section on 3/11/2010. With the pain I was lucky that I had a scheduled c-section booked as I wouldn’t have been able to push a baby out naturally. I still had back and groin pain however I just put up with it thinking that it would eventually go away. Unfortunately it has and over time it has gotten a lot worse. So on 2/3/11 I went to see the doctor who said I should go and have some physio done and if it don’t improve I should have a scan done. I then waited about another two weeks before making an appointment to see physio. I have had two treatments now and I am in a lot of pan. Physio feels that I will need a lot more treatments.

I am currently breast feeding and wish to breast feed for 12 months like I did with my other 2 children and because of this I can not use strong pain relief or anti inflammatory medicines.

I attach all my receipts and bills for you to look at and also a copy of my Medicare card and drivers licence. If you need to discuss this with me please feel free to contact me on [mobile telephone number].” (Exhibit A).


	
	The “two treatments” by the physiotherapist referred to in this letter were the first of a series of treatments all paid for by the defendants. The first of these appears to have taken place on 28 March 2011 (Exhibit A).
	
	
	What were the plaintiff’s complaints? The physiotherapist, Rachael Wiltshire, noted the plaintiff suffered injury to her “blt groin and right glut then LBP” (Exhibit A).
	
	
	The plaintiff was certainly assiduous in her attendances at the physiotherapist. She underwent further physiotherapy treatment on 29 March, 7 April, 11 April, 14 April, 18 April, 2 May, 9 May, 12 May, 20 May, 23 May, 26 May, 30 May, 2 June, 16 June, 20 June, 30 June, 11 July, 1 August, 17 August, 22 August, 29 August, 5 September, 12 September, 19 September, 13 October, 19 October, 26 October, 2 November, 9 November, 17 November, 7 December, 22 December and 29 December 2011.
	
	
	A notation appears shortly before the 18 April 2011 entry that the payment for these visits are “to go through third party/public liability”. She concluded the treatment on 4 January 2012. Ms Wiltshire kept Marissa Brenton of Chubb Insurance informed as to progress.
	
	
	On 9 May 2011, Ms Wiltshire provided a follow up report to Dr Sor as follows:
	


“Outcome:

Nicole’s symptoms are consistent with her mechanism of injury and unfortunately being a joint ligamentous injury the timing of the fall whilst heavily pregnant means the ligaments were softer and more likely to overstretch. Care of her baby also burdens the lumbopelvic area.

Nicole will need quite considerable supervised Physiotherapy – more so small group classes to improve mobility and strength – both of which are poor following 6 months of persistent pain.

Due to Nicole’s pain levels I am treating her 2x/week for 6-8 weeks and then lengthen to 1x/week or fortnight and progressing as able with core stability. I foresee Nicole will take some time to resolve.”


	
	The plaintiff underwent a CT of her lumbar spine on 11 May 2011. The results were essentially normal. She was not taking prescription pain medication over this period, but, as Dr Deveridge points out in his report of 24 November 2011, she was breastfeeding, and could only take simple medication such as Panadol osteo, “which does not really help” (Exhibit K).
	
	
	The plaintiff’s first specialist appointment is the medico-legal appointment with Dr Deveridge, who recommended conservative treatment such as physiotherapy, which the plaintiff continued with until early 2012.
	
	
	The plaintiff consulted Dr Abi-Hanna on 6 February 2012 but did not mention back pain. She had returned to work in early 2011, and was struggling both with competitors undercutting her and with having to reorganise her work in order to cope with back pain. There were increasing tensions at home during 2012 and the plaintiff and her husband separated in December 2012. The plaintiff moved to the South Coast to be closer to her mother. The family home, which was subject to a large mortgage, was first rented out and then sold.
	
	
	The plaintiff suffered a nervous breakdown in July 2013 and shut down her business at about the same time. She commenced psychological counselling with Ms Lyn Page on 17 August 2013 and then consulted Dr Burhan, a psychiatrist, on 5 June 2014. She is still receiving treatment from Dr Burhan. Further details of the plaintiff’s treatment are set out in the section of this judgment detailing the medical evidence.
	
	
	Although unemployed, the plaintiff attended the Australian Professional College to complete courses in finance and mortgage broking. She had difficulty attending the lectures and obtained a certificate from her psychologist. Her business, Harrington Park Financial Services, is currently unregistered for GST. Her company is still “running”, but no work is being received. Further details of the plaintiff’s loss of income are set out in the section of this judgment on economic loss.
	


The plaintiff’s claim for damages


	
	On behalf of the plaintiff, Mr Lidden SC provided a schedule of damages comprising 33% non-economic loss ($189,000), past economic loss of $149,300, future economic loss of $470,347, past superannuation at 11% net (corrected in submissions to 8% net) and future superannuation at 13.52% net (corrected to 10%, by reason of the plaintiff’s structure of profits in her business income tax), as well as past care of $63,335 and future care at 8 hours per week at $43 per week (corrected in submissions to provide for an alternative grant at $27.96 per hour if the future care is gratuitous, there being no evidence in relation to future paid care).
	
	
	There is no forensic accountant’s report in relation to economic loss. However, the plaintiff’s business and personal income tax returns had been provided and an agreed schedule has been prepared by the parties in relation to the method of calculation of economic loss.
	


The defendants’ failure to provide a schedule of damages


	
	Although required by the Practice Note to do so, the defendants did not provide any schedule of damages. Mr Sleight has provided written submissions stating (at paragraphs 89 and 91) that no claim is made out on the evidence for past and future economic loss, that the plaintiff fails to meet the threshold for past and future domestic assistance (paragraph 69) and, while past out of pocket expenses have been mathematically agreed, has invited me to disregard all of them. He has not addressed in relation to future out of pocket expenses, but it is my understanding that he considers no allowance should be made.
	
	
	It is not uncommon for there to be a wide discrepancy between the damages sought by the plaintiff and defendant. In Alat v Franklins Pty Ltd (2012) 15 DCLR (NSW) 203, Letherbarrow SC DCJ noted (at [47]) that the defendant’s schedule of damages was approximately 5% of the amount sought by the plaintiff. In the present case, the defendants effectively submit (although not providing a schedule to this effect) that the plaintiff should be awarded nothing.
	
	
	The practice of parties in personal injury proceedings of making submissions to the court of this extreme nature is unhelpful to the court. The result of this practice is that both parties adopt an extreme position rather than assisting the court to arrive at a reasonable and sensible range of appropriate damages for the injuries and disabilities in question. An accurate estimate of appropriate damages, set out in the schedule of damages required by the District Court Practice Note handed out by the Judicial Registrar when matters are set down for hearing, should be expected in all personal injury proceedings commenced in this court.
	
	
	When parties appeal from the quantum of damages, the absence of such information at first instance is as unhelpful to the appellate court as it is to the trial judge. Parties who make no submissions (beyond negative statements) are then able to run what amounts to an entirely different case to that conducted at the trial in relation to the assessment of damages. That is not a practice which is conducive to the efficient disposal of factual issues at the trial.
	


The plaintiff’s injuries, treatment and medical evidence


	
	The factual situation in these proceedings is unique, in that the plaintiff attended hospital the following day for a caesarean to be performed. It is first relevant to note by reason of her advanced stage of pregnancy, she was suffering from a condition called ligamentous laxity. Dr Deveridge explains this condition in his report of 10 June 2014 (Exhibit K):
	


“As previously reported she received treatment with physiotherapy – the therapist makes a relevant comment that she would have had ligamentous laxity around the injury site due to the late stages of pregnancy, rending her more susceptible to injury.”


	
	Dr Deveridge’s report have clearly been read by the defendants’ expert, Dr Schutz (see his reference from his report of 21 August 2014) and neither this diagnosis, nor its relationship to the injury, are challenged, or even discussed. This is a significant gap in the evidence of the defendants.
	
	
	The defendants challenge the circumstances in which the plaintiff failed to seek medical help about her back pain at all between her first consultation of Dr Sor nine days after the baby was born (12 November 2010) until 2 March 2011 is viewed by Dr Anthony Smith in his report of 12 June 2014 (Exhibit 3, page 3) as being implausible. Dr Smith considers that if her lower back and back pain were significant, it would have come to medical attention “long before” she first mentioned it to Dr Sor on 2 March 2011. She consulted Dr Lam on 16 January 2011 but did not refer to back or leg pain.
	
	
	The defendants submit that the plaintiff’s failure to complain of symptoms of pain to her general practitioner when she had the opportunity to do so must substantially undermine the plaintiff’s case, particularly as there is no pathology that supports the symptoms from which she is suffering (which is discussed in more detail below).
	
	
	As noted above, the explanation the plaintiff gives is that she thought her back would get better. She was aware of the changes to her muscles in the very late stages of pregnancy, as she had had the same condition in her previous two pregnancies, and she hoped that the pain would pass with time.
	
	
	A long gap between an injury and complaint to a medical practitioner is always significant, for the reasons explained by the New South Wales Court of Appeal in Nominal Defendant v Kostic [2007] NSWCA 14 and Whalan v Kogarah Municipal Council [2007] NSWCA 5. In the present circumstances, however, the circumstances in which the plaintiff had undergone a caesarean operation and was nursing a baby are, in my view, of considerable significance. The plaintiff had not simply had a baby; she had undergone a surgical procedure of a significant nature. Her mother came to live with her for four weeks after the birth to help her. She was not able to perform most tasks (including driving) until January 2011. It was reasonable for her to hope that the situation would improve with time. In particular, it would have been unwise for her to take medication while she was breastfeeding, for the reasons explained by Dr Deveridge.
	
	
	The plaintiff said she saw Dr Sor on 2 March 2011 because she had not improved, and she then commenced physiotherapy with Rachael Wiltshire on 28 March 2011. Ms Wiltshire’s notes (Exhibit A) set out in detail the plaintiff’s description of back pain over the whole of the period from 28 March 2011 to 4 January 2012. Dr Sor’s covering letter of 2 March 2011 confirms that the plaintiff was taking Panadol Back and Neck Long Lasting by this stage. Ms Wiltshire’s notes contain references to the plaintiff suffering pain, such as when she leaned into the baby’s pram to pick up groceries (20 May 2011), noting that the plaintiff started crying when describing her worry about “not getting better” (13 October 2011).
	
	
	The plaintiff tried strapping, strength classes, stretching exercises and other methods but on 26 October 2011, the sharp pain was unchanged. She was having problems sleeping (7 December 2011) and began to suffer from headaches (29 December 2011 and 4 January 2012).
	
	
	It was put to the plaintiff in cross-examination that her sole motive for visiting the physiotherapist was that she had consulted her solicitors for the purpose of commencing proceedings. Attached to the documents produced by Ms Wiltshire is a letter from the solicitors for the plaintiff and an authority signed by the plaintiff. This letter is dated 23 March 2013, not 2011, and this submission arises from an error as to the date when the plaintiff signed the relevant authority. The plaintiff clearly did consult solicitors later in 2011, as she was sent to Dr Deveridge at that time, but she commenced physiotherapy beforehand.
	
	
	As is set out below, the reports paint a picture of the plaintiff being increasingly unable to cope, at first physically and then psychologically, with pain. The question is what to make of these reports in circumstances where the plaintiff’s prior excellent medical and work history and her credibility as a witness (which Mr Sleight attacked only faint-heartedly) make the significant changes to her life difficult to attribute to other causes.
	


The plaintiff’s medico legal reports

Dr R Deveridge


	
	Dr Deveridge has provided four reports dated 24 November 2011, 10 June 2014, 2 April and 12 May 2015.
	
	
	Dr Deveridge states in his report of 24 November 2011:
	


“Your client has moderate ongoing disability with persistent low back pain, stiffness and non-verifiable radicular complaints referred to the right lower limb. Although the CT scan has excluded a significant disc protrusion, her back pain is mechanical in nature, and may well represent an annular disc tear. On the balance of probabilities, residual back and right leg disability is attributable to the fall on 2.11.2010.

During the advanced stages of pregnancy, there is significant ligamentous laxity in the spine, which may well have predisposed to a mechanical derangement. No significant pre-existing or pre-disposing conditions were identified.

She is considered unfit for repetitive bending, heavy lifting, carrying, twisting, pushing, dragging and prolonged periods of fixed spinal posture. She has reasonably had to increase her contracted workers hours to fulltime on the basis of this injury. This will be necessary until such time as there is significant improvement or recovery from her injury. She is also receiving gratuitous domestic assistance, as detailed above. This would amount to about 6 hours weekly of domestic care. She receives some minor personal assistance (she can’t cut her toenails or shave her legs).

Treatment will remain along conservative lines. She could require intermittent analgesic and/or anti-inflammatory medication. Physiotherapy ($70 per session) can be provided on a regular basis for up to two years following injury of this type. Thereafter it is unlikely to alter the course of the disability. Hydrotherapy ($60 per session) would also be appropriate at this stage. No surgically treatable injury has been identified.

Her condition is at a plateau, but there is still scope for further improvement over the next 12 months or so. The lack of improvement to date, does suggest that further recovery is going to be very slow, gradual and possibly incomplete. Her condition will stabilise in another 12 months time. The prognosis generally is uncertain, but guarded at this stage.”


	
	Dr Deveridge notes that she was having difficulty driving, as her job required her to frequently get into and out of her car at sales outlets, and that the worker who had previously been required for 20 hours a week now worked 40 hours, which had halved her income.
	
	
	Dr Deveridge next saw the plaintiff on 29 May 2014. His conclusions were as follows:
	


“Your client's condition has not materially altered since I last examined her. She has moderate residual disability with chronic low back pain, stiffness and non-verifiable radicular complaints referred to the right lower limb. She clearly suffers from mechanical low back pain, which is consistent with the mechanism of injury described. She has some mild trochanteric bursitis at the right hip. On the balance of probabilities, residual back and right leg disability is attributable to the fall on 2.11.2010. No significant pre-existent or pre-disposing conditions were identified.

She is going to be permanently unfit for repetitive bending, heavy lifting, carrying, twisting, pushing, and dragging. She should avoid prolonged periods of sitting or standing. She has been reasonably unable to function in her pre-accident capacity as a finance broker. Driving is limited to short and infrequent local trips for essential purposes only. She is not expected to return to gainful employment for which she would be otherwise suited by way of education and experience.

She is receiving gratuitous domestic home care assistance as detailed above. This would amount to at least 6 hours weekly on a long-term basis. It may need to be quantified by an occupational therapist from a home care service.

Treatment will remain along conservative lines. She will require ongoing medication indefinitely. Physiotherapy $80 per session has reasonably been ceased, and will not alter the course of her disability at this stage. A few sessions of formal hydrotherapy ($70 each), and provision of an annual pass to a heated swimming centre for unsupervised water based exercises, would be appropriate. She needs to improve core strength and to lose weight, although this is impractical with her limited exercise tolerance. No surgically treatable injury has been identified.

Her condition is now chronic and stabilised. She has reached maximal medical improvement. The prognosis remains guarded.

There is considerable stress reaction, depression and anxiety surrounding her physical injury. This is outside of my area of expertise and should be addressed by relevant specialists.

Her occupational pursuits, activities of daily living and her ability to enjoy life generally, have all been substantially reduced by the subject accident.”


	
	He notes that she had been receiving treatment from a psychologist and is due to see a psychiatrist, as well as being placed on a number of medications. In particulars, he notes that she has had to cut down her work and has continued to reduce her work with substantial loss of income; she now only arrange referrals of past customers for loans on occasion.
	
	
	In his report of 2 April 2015, Dr Deveridge notes the plaintiff now required “strong Opiate type analgesia to control her pain”. He noted that she provided “similar complaints to the previous occasion” in that her back pain was “always there but varies in severity”. She could sit for a maximum of 30 minutes but with increasing pain, and stand up for an hour providing that she moved around. There were restrictions in her daily activities, she was still considerably overweight (at 115 kgs) and was still having problems driving a car; although given a lift to the doctor’s surgery for the appointment, she had still had to stop and stretch on the way. His conclusion was that on each of the three occasions he had examined her, her complaints were “consistent, reasonably and I have no reason to doubt them”. They were now complicated by a psychiatric overlay, for which prognosis had been reported as “poor”. He had the following to say about the plaintiff’s domestic home care assistance:
	


“She requires domestic home care assistance as detailed above. I consider that this would amount to at least six hours weekly on a long-term basis. One of the independent assessors (Dr. E. Schutz) has indicated that she did demonstrate her ability to mow the lawn for six to eight months after the accident. She states that this was the case, but she was taking Endone in order to do that task, and she was in more pain afterwards. I consider that she has reasonably ceased home and yard maintenance on the basis of her chronic pain.

Treatment will involve ongoing medication indefinitely. She will need to see her general practitioner every month or two for repeat prescriptions. Physiotherapy ($85 per session) and/or hydrotherapy ($75 per session) are not likely to alter the course of her disability some 4 1/2 years after the fall. However a reasonable course of therapy, say 9 sessions over three to four weeks, could be supportive in nature. It may help her to get back to an unsupervised exercise programme, and to lose some weight. She does not require invasive treatment (guided injections or operations).

Her condition remains chronic and stabilised. She has reached maximal medical improvement. Further recovery is likely to be impeded by the associated stress reaction, depression and anxiety, which has complicated her physical injuries.”


	
	Dr Deveridge’s report of 12 May 2015 essentially repeats these findings.
	
	
	The defendants submit that Dr Deveridge gives no justification for the conclusion that she reasonably had to increase her contracted worker’s hours to full time on the basis of the injury. However, Dr Deveridge records this information as a fact, not an opinion. He goes on to note the impact of her ongoing disabilities in relation to her work, and in particular to her ability to drive and tolerate sitting down for long periods, and it is not necessary for him to cross-reference this with the employment arrangements that she has told him she has.
	
	
	One aspect of Dr Deveridge’s reports requires comment. He observes, correctly, that her claim for home care may need to be quantified by an occupational therapist from a home care service. As Basten JA notes in Boral Bricks Pty Ltd v Cosmidis [2013] NSWCA 443 and Sampco Pty Ltd v Wurth [2015] NSWCA 117, opinions of this nature should be expressed by occupational therapists, rather than medical practitioners. I have based my assessment of the plaintiff’s entitlement to home care upon the lay evidence, and I have disregarded Dr Deveridge’s recommendations in this regard.
	


Dr J Bodel


	
	Dr Bodel first saw the plaintiff on 5 March 2014. He notes that before the accident she had been a very active, healthy person, who enjoyed bicycle riding, surfing and dancing, but had not returned to these activities and had gained substantial weight.
	
	
	Dr Bodel states that at the time of the accident, the plaintiff’s advanced stage of pregnancy meant that “soft tissue injuries to the musculoskeletal system are very common in this circumstance”. He considered, however, her prognosis should be “quite reasonable”, as he could define “no objective sign of major structural injury and with improved physical fitness levels her symptoms should settle”. He went on to say:
	


“If there is some definite disc pathology then she may need interventional treatment which could include injections or surgery but I see no absolute indication that that will be required on the basis of her current clinical presentation.”


	
	Dr Bodel provided a further report of 18 March 2015. He notes that a CT scan of the lumbosacral spine showed “no major abnormality”. He also notes the strong medication which the plaintiff is taking.
	
	
	Dr Bodel considers the exact cause of the plaintiff’s ongoing pain to be uncertain. The only investigations that he had seen consisted of a CT scan which showed no definite disc pathology. While he considered she was not able to engage in work that required “repetitive bending, twisting or heavy lifting”, this has some of the flavour of a phrase often used in medical reports. The plaintiff’s finance work would be unlikely to involve her in any of those activities.
	
	
	Dr Bodel makes it clear that the plaintiff’s ongoing disabilities, and in particular her ongoing pain, had a cause which was uncertain. Although Mr Lidden SC submitted to me that she had developed some kind of pain syndrome, there is no evidence to this effect. According to the plaintiff’s medical history, she attended a pain clinic but without any benefit or result. Accordingly, Dr Bodel’s reports are of limited assistance to the plaintiff, in that he considers, particularly in his first report dated 5 March 2014 (Exhibit H), that her symptoms “should settle”.
	


Dr M Ellis


	
	Dr Ellis prepared a medico-legal report dated 24 October 2014. He noted both her previous good health and the results of a CT lumbar spine scan 11 May 2011, which were essentially normal. His conclusion is as follows:
	


“As a result of the fall in the Narellan Town Centre on 2 November 2010, Mrs Murka has suffered musculo-ligamentous contusion, aggravation of future degenerative change in her lumbar spine and there are secondary effects in the right leg, referred pain to the hip and to the leg and neurological deficit, weakness and impaired sensation.

Radiologically the MRI examination of the lumbar spine has revealed desiccation or internal disc disruption affecting the lumbar discs and there is arthropathy in the facet joints, which have been aggravated by the fall.

Prior to the fall she was a successful finance broker working full time. As a result of continued pain, loss of employment, and financial difficulty, she has suffered psychologically with continued depression, anxiety and panic attacks requiring psychiatric treatment and extensive list of medication with only slight improvement. She is unable to return to her work because of her back condition, which is aggravated by prolonged sitting and the driving involved and the continuing psychological symptoms

Continued medical supervision and conservative treatment for pain relief will be required. Medications, consultations, intermittent physiotherapy, psychiatric treatment, these items are likely to cost at least $4,000 annually and the need is likely to continue over the next few years

There is no evidence of psychosomatic illness and no evidence of previous abnormality, debility or injury affecting her back and her psychological status was normal, she was working successfully full time with no need for previous advice or treatment.

On the evidence available surgical intervention is not indicated.

Domestic assistance at home has been necessary to the extent of four hours twice a week and the need is likely to continue.

There are impairments of activities of daily living, referred to above, and her lifestyle is degraded with loss of recreational activities.

It is four years since the accident and her condition appears to be stationary. On the evidence available it is unlikely she will be able to return to her work as a finance broker and she will remain unfit for physically demanding work requiring bending and lifting.

I have read and agree to be bound by the Expert Witness Code of Conduct.”


	
	As with the other medico legal reports, Dr Ellis can point to no pathology giving rise to the aggravation of future degenerative change referred to. He has accepted that the plaintiff suffers from the pain and restriction of movement without comment. He goes on to consider (irrelevantly, for the purpose of these proceedings) what her permanent impairment levels are, in a separate report dated 24 October 2014. I have disregarded that report, and also his comments about home care, for which I note the reasoning is not exposed in any event.
	


Dr A Smith


	
	Dr Smith’s medico legal report of 12 June 2014 is dismissive of the plaintiff’s complaints. He considers it significant that the plaintiff failed to complain of ongoing low back pain prior to 2 March 2011 and does not refer to the impact of her advanced pregnancy or caesarean operation. He does not refer to her physiotherapy treatments during 2011 until early 2012. He merely notes that there is “nothing wrong with her on clinical examination” and that it is “inappropriate” that she can only bend to the low thighs but have a straight leg raising of 90 degrees and sit up to 90 degrees of straight leg raising (Exhibit 3). He considers that she might have aggravated some degenerative process “for we all have lumbar degenerative disease”, and that this might explain her current condition and complaints. However, somewhat inconsistently, he considers that she should have recovered in a few days or a few weeks at most.
	
	
	Dr Smith’s report contains a series of statements for which the reasoning is not exposed, in that he states that the plaintiff has suffered a soft tissue injury which should have resolved within a matter of weeks of the event. He does not refer to the role the plaintiff’s condition of advanced pregnancy could have played in the injury, or to whether the plaintiff was at any increased risk of injury. I see this as a significant oversight.
	


Dr E Schutz


	
	Dr Schutz provides a reported dated 21 August 2014. He notes that the CT scan performed after the plaintiff consulted her general practitioner on 11 May 2011 was normal. He notes that the plaintiff’s general practitioner diagnosed right trochanteric bursitis and low back soft tissue injury. He goes on to state:
	


“Ms Murko has continued to report symptoms in the same regions. There has been no diagnosed significant problem of the lumbar spine. There was no clinical evidence on this examination of any significant problem in the buttock or thigh more than possible soft tissue symptoms which, at this point almost 4 years post-accident, would be expected to have effectively recovered. Note that the cause of the currently reported symptoms has not been identified but seems very unlikely to be due to the 2010 accident.”


	
	He gives a diagnosis as follows:
	


“Current diagnosis relevant to the case:

Right buttock symptoms of a mild soft tissue nature.

Mild discomfort over the greater trochanter region – possible minimal trochanteric bursitis.

Mild discomfort over the adductor muscles in the upper right thigh – a mild soft tissue symptom.

Low back symptoms – mainly actually in the right buttock. She demonstrated a restricted range of movements.

No evidence of radicular symptoms.”


	
	He had the following to say about the significant amount of medication she was taking:
	


“Ms Murko is on much medication. The reason for such significant medication, at least for the physical symptoms, was not apparent on the findings on this examination.

It is possible that she may have further investigations for the lumbar spine or hip region but, on the findings on this examination, the likelihood is that any results would be unremarkable.

There is consequently no indication for additional treatment for the physical symptoms.

The anticipated future cost of pain relief would be of simple over-the-counter medication.”


	
	His prognosis was as follows:
	


“As above, symptoms following a direct blow to the buttock would be expected to recover over a period of 6-12 weeks or 6-12 months at the maximum. Currently reported symptoms and restrictions are substantially in excess of what would be anticipated based on the clinical and radiological findings.

Lumbar spine: There was no evidence of an abnormality on the CT scans. Although there was a restriction in movement there was no clinical evidence of any more than mild reported symptoms and it was noted that she could lean forward with sitting on the couch despite demonstrated restricted movements.”


	
	Dr Schutz has provided an additional report of the same date answering the report of Dr Deveridge. He notes that the plaintiff was able to mow the lawn after the accident but that she is no longer doing this, and that certain of the findings of Dr Deveridge (such as the “paraspinal muscles spasm” and “asymmetry”) which he had noted in 2011 were not noted on her August 2014 examination. Similarly, there were no complaints made that pain persisted into the night to limit her sleep or of intermittent leg cramps. He agrees with Dr Deveridge that the medication the plaintiff required was “intermittent analgesic and/or anti-Inflammatory medication” and that this was all that was required. I infer from this that he considers her current regime of medication excessive.
	
	
	Dr Schutz does not, however, address the issues Dr Deveridge raises about the impact of advanced pregnancy on the plaintiff’s musculoskeletal frame. I consider that a significant omission. His report, like that of Dr Smith, is of little assistance for these reasons.
	


Conclusions concerning the plaintiff’s back injury


	
	The difficulty I have with the reports tendered by the defendants is that they do not take into account the observations, by both Dr Deveridge and Dr Bodel (see Exhibit H), that soft tissue injuries to the musculoskeletal system are very common in circumstances of the injury in question where the plaintiff is in a very advanced state of pregnancy. In other words, an injury occurring in circumstances of the kind which occurred here could cause more injury than would otherwise be the case.
	
	
	However, even Dr Bodel considers that her prognosis should be quite reasonable, and that her symptoms should settle. The reason for the symptoms failing to settle, and for the increasingly heavy dosage of medication that she is obviously taken, remain difficult to determine, as the plaintiff’s psychiatrist, Dr Burhan, notes in his letters to the plaintiff’s general practitioner.
	
	
	Additionally, the development of these problems is the plaintiff’s anxiety and depression, which give rise to a condition which she said has resulted in a nervous breakdown, and for which she is receiving ongoing treatment as well as medication.
	
	
	The evidence paints a picture of a husband and wife working long hours to service a large mortgage, who, the day after the plaintiff’s accident, found themselves having to care for a new baby. The plaintiff was clearly focused on the new baby and her family but continuing to suffer from back pain despite being assiduous in following up treatment for the whole of 2011. Her real problems seem to have started after she stopped that treatment.
	
	
	As I have noted in the section below in relation to psychiatric evidence, the plaintiff’s increasing feelings of helplessness and depression, in which the breakdown of her marriage and loss of the family home played a part, appears to have led her to focus upon her back pain. The plaintiff’s medical evidence suggests that the level of actual pain in the plaintiff’s back has become increasingly distorted by the fact that it was the final blow in circumstances where she was barely able to manage her work and home responsibilities beforehand.
	
	
	I shall next consider the question of the plaintiff’s claim for psychiatric injury.
	


The plaintiff’s claim for psychiatric injury

Dr B Teoh


	
	Dr Teoh has provided two reports dated 10 April 2014 and 13 May 2015. He notes that she is “preoccupied with her chronic pain and physical disability” because her condition “has not improved significantly” and she had expressed “a sense of hopelessness”. She had been referred to a psychologist, whom she had seen for about six sessions, and then referred to a psychiatrist. She had been prescribed Effexor.
	
	
	Dr Teoh diagnosed chronic adjustment disorder with depressed mood. He has not, however, exposed his reasoning for doing so. He notes that she suffers “chronic pain and physical disability and psychiatric symptoms”. He describes her prognosis as “poor” in that her condition had become chronic and her not responded to treatment. He considered she could benefit from seeing a psychiatrist fortnightly to monthly for six months.
	
	
	Dr Teoh’s report fails to expose his reasoning. Reports of this brevity are of little assistance to the court. Nevertheless, his reports make some contribution towards understanding the plaintiff’s condition.
	


Mr G Glancey


	
	Mr Glancey has provided three reports dated 20 March 2014 and 7 and 20 April 2015. His reports are attacked on the basis of asserted factual errors as follows:
	



	
	Whether the plaintiff reported strong pain after the fall, including sleep disturbance on the night of the fall and having to enlist the assistance of her eldest daughter to shower and wash her hair following the fall. However, I note the plaintiff made these comments in her letter to Marissa Brenton in April 2011 (Exhibit A).
	
	
	That she suffered back pain lying in bed – The plaintiff did, however, refer to problems of pain while in bed. I consider this asserted inconsistency to be trivial.
	
	
	That she requested an early discharge from hospital when the plaintiff did not agree that this was the case – the plaintiff was only in hospital for a day and a half. She agreed she told Mr Glancey that she sought an early discharge (T 103).
	
	
	That she promptly attended her general practitioner about back pain – However, Mr Glancey has not said this (see page 2 of his report of 20 March 2014).
	
	
	Her anxiety about the well-being of the foetus – Mr Glancey’s reports are consistent with the plaintiff’s statement that she wanted to go home and ensure her baby was moving and she was not bleeding.
	
	
	She planned to have six months off work following the birth – While the plaintiff denied this, there is a note to this effect in the notes of physiotherapist Rachael Wiltshire (Exhibit A) who comments that the plaintiff’s aim is “6/12 back at work”.
	
	
	Statements made by Mr Glancey which the plaintiff challenges – Mr Glancey’s statement are consistent with those made to other medical practitioners.
	
	
	Losing $50,000 per annum as consequence of her inability to work – The plaintiff agrees that this could not be correct. I do not regard this as a significant error.
	
	
	The plaintiff suffered a dramatic exacerbation of anxiety and depression in July 2013 – The plaintiff’s anxiety and depression did not come on suddenly. The plaintiff’s evidence was that she had a nervous breakdown in July 2013 and that she commenced psychological counselling with Ms Page on 17 August 2013.
	



	
	Mr Glancey’s reports carefully rule out a series of potential unrelated stressors. These include mood disturbance following the birth of her child (Exhibit K, report 20 March 2014, page 2), being able to breastfeed her child, which continued for two years, her attitude to pain generally, and her family structure including the reasons for breakdown of the marriage. She described to Mr Glancey how she had “lost her previous tolerance of pain, following her breakdown” (same report, page 4).
	
	
	Mr Glancey notes that the plaintiff acknowledged pre-existing stress within the relationship as a consequence of a fractious relationship between Mr Murko and her younger daughter. There was additional pre-existing stress in the form of the behaviour of her first husband, although the plaintiff denied that that greatly stressed her relationship with her second husband. The marriage breakdown at her initiation in December 2012 and although attempts were made to save the home, it had to be sold. The plaintiff acknowledged “a great sense of loss associated with that development” as well as being “unable to return to her former employment”. Mr Glancey considers these are all interwoven problems, in that the back pain is an aggravating factor.
	
	
	Mr Glancey considers that the level of disturbance reported by the plaintiff warranted intervention by a psychiatrist. Medication is insufficient. He considers she would also benefit from treatment by a psychologist in conjunction with psychiatric treatment.
	
	
	The most helpful report of Mr Glancey is his report of 20 April 2015, in which he comments on similar findings Dr Robert Lewin made in a report of 4 June 2014, which was not tendered by the defendants, in that the plaintiff was diagnosed as suffering from “Single Major Depressive Episode”, with a note of the reasonable likelihood of a positive response to treatment, although there was a likelihood that the psychiatric condition would persist.
	
	
	Dr Lewin expressed the view that there were multiple contributing factors to her mental disturbance and notes his conclusion that the breakup of her relationship was a consequence of her decreased functioning, both physical and mental, in the months and years following the accident. Mr Glancey concludes that there is “little difference between the opinion of Dr Lewin and myself”, from which I infer that he considers that the breakdown of the marital relationship played a role in the onset of the depressive disturbance in mid-2013. However, Mr Glancey considers that the plaintiff’s back pain was a significant factor not only in her depression but also in relation to the events leading to the breakdown of the marriage.
	
	
	Mr Glancey’s opinion is supportive of the role the plaintiff’s back pain has played in the breakdown of her business and marriage. While I have exercised caution in relation to his comments about Dr Lewin’s unserved report, the fact remains that there is no evidence of a psychiatric or psychological nature to contradict the plaintiff’s expert evidence.
	


Dr A Burhan


	
	Only Dr Burhan’s notes are available. Unlike Mr Glancey and Dr Teoh, he has the advantage of having seen the plaintiff on a number of occasions in the context of providing treatment. Additionally, his reports are written to the plaintiff’s general practitioner and are both frank and objective in their tone. He describes the history of her present illness in his report of 5 June 2014 (Exhibit J) as follows:
	


“No history of mental illness before 2010. She had a fall and hurt her back during that year and subsequently developed chronic pain in her back that radiates to the right thigh both anterior and posterior aspects. For a while she didn't see she was getting depressed over this and was insisting that her problem is the pain only, but over the last four years her mood was predominantly low and her motivation and sense of being in control vanished. In this period she lost her business and second marriage, and was forced to sell her house due to financial difficulties. In July last year she had a very unusual experience while in a car with a friend, in which she felt the car was speeding and eventually overturning. She felt unreal and frightened at the time. Subsequent to this experience she started having recurrent panic attacks, ongoing anxiety, low mood and a sense of loosing [sic] control accompanied by a sense of hopelessness and helplessness.

She struggles with sleep and had put on at least 20kg the last year. Now she feels low, panic attacks once or twice a week, massive anxiety if she needs to go out of the house, low self-esteem.”


	
	He lists on page 2 the “current stressors” as being that she is a single mother, she is unemployed and she has financial difficulties. However, he adds “current and past medical issues” as “Lower back pain, couldn’t do MRI back due to her severe anxiety”. His conclusion is as follows:
	


“Nicole Murko presents with a history of mixed anxiety and depression in the context of chronic back pain. She is pre morbidly someone who likes to be in control, but since her back injury she lost that sense. She had many loses over the last four years since the injury and is now becoming very anxious, depressed and hopeless. In my opinion it is crucial to find out the exact nature of her back injury and therefore MRI is a must. I think a 10mg of Medazolam before the procedure should help to complete this mission. As you have tried Citalopram (SSRI) and Venlafaxine (SNRI) in addition to psychotherapy, I think we should try TCA and therefore I commenced her from today on Amitriptyline 25mg at night with a reduction of Venlafaxine from 300mgto 150 mg a day.”


	
	He goes on to diagnose “major depression with anxiety features in the context of chronic pain”.
	
	
	A follow up report of 19 June 2014 paints much the same picture. A report of 22 July 2014 is the same.
	
	
	Mr Sleight submitted that I should find, from the fact that the last report is dated July 2014, that the plaintiff is no longer seeing Dr Burhan. However, Mr Lidden SC points out that the plaintiff said in her evidence she was still seeing Dr Burhan, and, for the avoidance of doubt, tendered the subpoena dated 8 July 2014 to explain the reason for the most recent report being dated July 2014.
	
	
	The plaintiff therefore has a history of mixed anxiety and depression in the context of chronic back pain. As someone who pre-morbidly liked to be in control, she has lost that sense. She had many other losses over the last four years since the injury and her condition is unresolved.
	
	
	Dr Burhan’s view that it was “crucial to find out the exact nature of her back injury” is revealing. As the treating doctor, and someone who has taken a careful history from the plaintiff, which has been reported back to the plaintiff’s general practitioner, I am of the view that Dr Burhan’s opinions are of the most assistance in disentangling the complexities of the plaintiff’s ongoing chronic back pain problems.
	
	
	I also note that the plaintiff’s psychologist, Lyn Page, provided a “To Whom it May Concern” letter outlining the problems the plaintiff would have attending a training course. This letter provides some corroborative information about the problems the plaintiff was having at the time, but is of limited assistance to me as it sets out only a brief description rather than a professional opinion.
	
	
	This is a convenient opportunity for me to note, as requested by Mr Sleight, my reasons for allowing documents produced on subpoena identifying Dr Burhan’s and Ms Page’s opinions (but not Dr Burhan’s medico-legal report) into evidence.
	


Objection to tender of Dr Burhan’s report and notes of consultation and to the psychologist’s letter concerning the plaintiff’s attendance problems.


	
	Mr Sleight’s objection to the tender of this referral letter, which came from packet 5 of the material produced by Dr Burhan under subpoena, is derived from the statements of Bryson J in Rusu at [28]:
	


“[28] So far as I am aware there is no judgment which has decided that under the Evidence Act, 1995 the authenticity of a document tendered in evidence may be determined simply on the basis of the form and contents of the document or on that basis taken with information about the source from which it was produced showing that it was produced on subpoena and by whom. References in case law to authentication of documents tendered are usually brief and incidental. Texts dealing with the legislation do not appear to have commented to the effect that under the legislation documents establish their own authenticity. See the comment on business records in Cross on Evidence , 5th Australian Ed (JD Heydon QC) at para5540 - para5550, which deals with s48 and s69, among others and makes no comparison with s45b of the Evidence Act 1929 (South Australia) with which that work deals at [35400]. I have not noticed any such observation in Mr Odgers' ""Uniform Evidence Law"" 3rd Ed 1998 either.”


	
	Bryson J went on to state at [30]:
	


“[34] If the Court is to find a significant fact on which a large liability may depend, there is a need for the Court to have some measure of confidence in the source of the Court's belief that the fact exists. The Court acts almost always on narrations which must have a human origin; not usually on the Court's own knowledge or on states of fact which are taken to be incontestable. The balance of probabilities is not a demanding standard, as the possibility that the less probable state of fact may be the true one is very obvious, and makes civil justice very vulnerable to error. For the Court to feel confident that it should act on any narration it is very important to have a human witness who has pledged, by oath or affirmation, that the narration is true: someone who is responsible for it. Business records may be incomplete; they often are. They record what there is perceived to be a business need to record, and that may be a small part or an oblique aspect of the objective event.


	
	Mr Sleight submits that the only way the provenance of this letter of referral can be proved is if Dr Burhan presents himself for cross-examination so that the provenance of the letter can be tested.
	
	
	The correct approach to an objection of this kind is explained by McColl JA in Jones Lang LaSalle (NSW) Pty Ltd v Taouk [2012] NSWCA 342 at [34]. The document the subject of objection in those proceedings (which coincidentally arose from a slip on grease in a car park, and involved the same insurer) was a contract between the defendants. As the defendants did not seek reasons at the time, McColl JA considered it was not necessary to determine the issue, but nevertheless noted:
	


“[34] It is not submitted that the primary judge committed an error of law in not giving reasons for his decision to reject the tender of MFI 5. Nor is it shown that his Honour erred in rejecting that tender. The first question which was required to be addressed was whether the document was relevant because it could rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue: ss 55, 56 of the Evidence Act Smith v R [2001] HCA 50 ; 206 CLR 650 at [6]–[7]. MFI 5 was tendered as an agreement, although no specific evidence was led to establish its authenticity as such. It can be assumed, for the purposes of this analysis, that the question as to its relevance fell to be determined on the basis that the document was what it purported to be: cf National Australia Bank v Rusu [1999] NSWSC 539 ; 47 NSWLR 309 which concerned the admissibility of two pages which, although tendered as business records containing representations as to payments made into an account of the second defendant with the Advance Bank, did not on their face identify the bank or customer and were not otherwise proved by admissible evidence to be records of transactions between those parties. It is not necessary in this case to consider the correctness of the observations in that case as to the operation of s 58 of the Evidence Act and the extent to which documents may authenticate themselves: see also Daw v Toyworld (NSW) Pty Ltd [2001] NSWCA 25 ; NSWCCR 389 at [46]; Australian Securities and Investment Commission v Rich [2005] NSWSC 417 ; 216 ALR 320; Barescape Pty Ltd v Bacchus Holdings Pty Ltd (No 5) [2011] NSWSC 1307; cf Lee v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCAFC 305.

[35] The fact of an agreement between JLL and Group 4 Securitas for the provision of services which included the monitoring of alarms may have been relevant to a defence that JLL exercised reasonable skill and care in engaging others to take steps to keep the car park and grease trap areas, reasonably safe. As Hodgson JA observed in Bevillesta Pty Ltd v Liberty International Insurance Co at [53] discharge of the duty of an occupier in this way “requires reasonable skill and care in the selection of the other person, in arranging the terms of engagement of that person, and in confirming that the person does take appropriate steps”.”


	
	The objection in those proceedings was on the basis of relevance, rather than authenticity, as all relevant parties appear to have taken for granted that a document created by them and complete in itself thereby authenticated itself. I consider Dr Burhan’s notes and letters of referral, which form part of the plaintiff’s treatment, and the “To whom it may concern” letter from Ms Page to be admissible for the same reasons as I have noted elsewhere.
	


The “Code of Conduct” objection


	
	The defendants also object to the tender of a letter from the plaintiff’s psychologist explaining her course attendance problems (agreed not to be written for the purposes of this litigation) and a report from the plaintiff’s treating doctor (addressed to the plaintiff’s solicitors) on the basis that neither of these documents refers to the Code of Conduct. Mr Sleight submits that this amounts to a complete bar.
	
	
	A number of decisions of the NSW Supreme Court have emphasized the necessity of an expert witness agreeing to abide by a court-imposed code of conduct: Barak Pty Ltd v WTH Pty Ltd (2002) NSWSC 649, [5] (Barrett J); Commonwealth Development Bank of Australia Pty Ltd v Cassegrain [2002] NSWSC 980, [9], [11]–[14] (Einstein J); United Rural Enterprises Pty Ltd v Lopmand Pty Ltd [2003] NSWSC 870, [10] (Campbell J); Ray Fitzpatrick Pty Ltd v Minister for Planning (2007) NSWLEC 791. Einstein J raised the test to one of “exceptional circumstances” in Gemworth Financial Mortgage Insurance Pty Ltd v Hodder Rook & Associates Pty Ltd [2010] NSWSC 1043. While the NSW Court of Appeal held, on appeal from this decision, that such a test could not be read into the relevant rule ([2011] NSWCA 279 at [57] – [63]), and noted each case must be considered on its merits, the importance of acknowledging the code of conduct was nevertheless emphasized.
	
	
	Before going further, I note that in Investmentsource Corp Pty Ltd v Knox Street Apartments Pty Ltd [2007] NSWSC 1128 at [50] McDougall J indicated that an exception to the rule would apply where the report was produced independently of the proceedings. That is the short answer to the objection to the psychologist’s report, which was not only prepared for independent purposes but before litigation had even commenced.
	
	
	There are a number of difficulties with requiring strict adherence to the code, and with imposing a “one size fits all” approach to the tender of documents in such different causes of action as commercial causes of action and personal injury. I summarise these as follows:
	



	
	An expert may not wish to be called, or may refuse to provide a report, in relation to the events in question. In those circumstances, it cannot be the intention of the legislature to shut out a party from adducing that evidence, as J Forrest J points out in Matthews v SPI Electricity Pty Ltd (No 9) [2009] VSC 340 at [27] – [29].
	
	
	Merely because a witness has expertise does not mean that his or her evidence is opinion evidence: Gumana v Northern Territory of Australia (2005) 141 FCR 457. This is particularly the case in professional negligence actions, where courts are often cautious about the reliance upon expert evidence in any event. A witness who gives evidence based on his or her own observations as a solicitor or doctor as to medical or legal procedures may not be expressing a point of view but stating observable facts.
	
	
	Additionally, the contents of any report that is prepared by an expert witness will often contain material that is not really opinion at all. In ASIC v Rich, Austin J noted a number of examples of evidence of this kind which would be relevant to personal injury claims, such as the observations of a medical practitioner during a clinical examination. While the witness’s expertise may be relevant to the making of the observation, it is nevertheless a factual observation.
	
	
	Special regard should be had to proceedings for personal injury where the parties all rely upon a whole series of potentially expert opinions by hospitals, compensation providers, doctors and ambulance officers as well as the medico-legal reports actually prepared for the proceedings. Such reports are generally obtained under subpoena and are a recognised exception to the requirement that a party relying upon the report must obtain a statement as to the Code of Conduct.
	
	
	It ought to go without saying, but reports prepared by treating doctors at all times, and particularly prior to the commencement of proceedings, ought not to be required to include the Code of Conduct other than in circumstances where the sole purpose of the report is for the tender in court proceedings.
	



	
	As J Forrest J noted in Matthews at [42], undoubtedly there will be cases where the distinction is “difficult to make”. However the requirement that all reports capable of amounting to expert evidence contain the code of conduct, even though prepared for non-litigation purposes, seems to me unduly pedantic.
	
	
	Nor is it the cases that reports other than medico-legal reports should be challenged in the same “Makita” (Makita (Australia) Pty Ltd v Sprowles (2001) 51 NSWLR 705) way that medico-legal reports should be challenged. The NSW Court of Appeal has recognised this in a series of decisions, by warning trial judges not to be over-literal in the interpretation of ambulance reports, triage and hospital records, which are written by busy professionals for purposes other than assisting the court, namely administering medical or medically-related treatment, sometimes of an urgent nature.
	
	
	The purpose of the Code of Conduct is to draw to the attention of experts what their obligations are. Reports which do not contain it should be scrutinised with care, but there are well-recognised exceptions to the rule, such as letters to general practitioners, records of consultation, medical certificates provided for absences from work and documents obtained under subpoena, notably hospital, ambulance and discharge reports.
	
	
	I accept that the report of Dr Burhan, the treating psychiatrist consulted by the plaintiff on 5 June 2014, is inadmissible for this reason. However, Dr Burhan is treating the plaintiff, and has written reports to her general practitioner. Those reports may be admitted into evidence as this correspondence does not require acknowledgement of the Code of Conduct in order to be admissible.
	


Conclusions concerning medical evidence


	
	The medical evidence in these proceedings presents a common problem in personal injury proceedings, in the form of diametrically opposed views of experts: the plaintiff’s orthopaedic experts indicate she has back injury and pain of some seriousness, and the defendant’s orthopaedic experts say she has nothing wrong with her. The tipping factor, in my opinion, is the regularity of the plaintiff’s visits to the physiotherapist, and her attempts to resolve her problems by massage and exercise classes, and the compelling nature of the reports concerning her ongoing psychiatric problems. I am satisfied that the plaintiff’s complaints of back pain are genuine, although the reasons for their continuance are a matter of dispute.
	
	
	The unusual factor in these proceedings is that the psychiatric evidence tendered by the plaintiff is both strong and unchallenged. The plaintiff has undergone counselling from a psychologist and a psychiatrist. Dr Burhan’s observations are particularly helpful, and I am satisfied that the plaintiff has a significant and ongoing problem which may not respond well to treatment.
	


Assessment of damages


	
	I set out my findings in relation to the heads of damage claimed.
	


Non-economic loss


	
	The plaintiff claims 33% pursuant to s 16 of the Civil Liability Act, which is calculated at $189,000. The defendant submits that the plaintiff has wholly recovered from her injuries and falls well under the threshold for non-economic loss.
	
	
	Overall, as to physical injury, I accept the evidence of Dr Deveridge that the plaintiff’s increased vulnerability due to her pregnancy could be a factor. The evidence of psychiatric problems is all favourable to the plaintiff; she continues to suffer from moderate symptoms, with some prospect of improvement with regular sessions with Dr Burhan.
	
	
	However, I do not accept either party’s submission as to the quantum of non-economic loss. Both are at the extreme end of the range. The plaintiff’s disability is a pain condition with psychiatric sequelae. She does not require surgery for her back condition, and her perception of pain may respond to ongoing counselling and treatment from Dr Burhan.
	
	
	Taking into account the range of damages for disabilities of this kind, I assess the plaintiff’s entitlement under this head as 25% of a most extreme case.
	
	
	The parties will be granted leave to hand up short minutes of order reflecting the mathematically agreed quantum of damages. I have taken this course because I have calculated certain heads of damage in amounts different to those the subject of submissions, and I consider it preferable to leave the precise calculation of the sum to the parties.
	


Past out of pocket expenses


	
	The defendant specifically does not seek reimbursement for the cost of the visits to the physiotherapist (which were $70 for the initial consultation, $60 thereafter and $160 for the exercise class).
	
	
	Mr Sleight told me that the plaintiff’s past out of pocket expenses should be restricted to physical injury, on the basis that the past out of pockets for psychological/psychiatric costs were unrelated (T 203). However, he did not undertake the exercise of dividing those costs up for me, or provide me with the data so that I could carry out the task myself.
	
	
	Where there are objections to past out of pockets, the defendant must identify those out of pocket expenses with precision, as otherwise the court is entitled to accept those amounts without further analysis: Dybka v McKenzie [2001] NSWCA 171 at [13].
	
	
	The plaintiff is entitled to past out of pockets in the sum of $4,467.00 as claimed.
	


Future out of pocket expenses


	
	The plaintiff claims a cushion of $30,000 for future medical expenses. Mr Lidden submitted that this was a long term condition (T 213). I note Dr Burhan’s concern that the precise nature of the plaintiff’s back pain needs to be identified, and that she has continued to consult him in relation to her psychiatric issues until shortly before these proceedings.
	
	
	The defendant’s submission is that the plaintiff should not be awarded any future medical costs, because “no one can find any pathological or frank injury that's caused this” (T 203). Mr Sleight went on to say that “no one here can actually find a frank injury caused by this accident, and it's said to be unattributable to any frank injury”. Any claim for psychiatric injury should be disregarded as unrelated to the accident.
	
	
	I am satisfied that the plaintiff will require significant psychiatric counselling in order to resolve her ongoing symptoms. I have very little information about the cost, but some allowance must be made. Additionally, the plaintiff may require other treatment for her back pain such as hydrotherapy, to which several of the reports referred.
	
	
	As to medication, all of the plaintiff’s expert reports comment on the undesirability of the plaintiff continuing to take strong medication of this kind, and I am reluctant to make any significant allowance for such expenses.
	
	
	While I consider the sum of $30,000 to be high, the absence of careful analysis of this head of damage by the defendants makes it difficult for me to determine what reductions, if any, should be made. Accordingly I propose to award the sum of $30,000 proposed by the plaintiff.
	


Past and future economic loss


	
	The plaintiff at all relevant times up until ceasing work operated her own business. The parties agreed upon a method of approach to economic loss in relation to the mathematically agreed calculations set out below:

Past economic loss


	
	The plaintiff told the physiotherapist and Mr Glancey that she intended to take 6 months off work following the birth of her child. The plaintiff’s proposal of $350 net per week takes this up to 1 July 2013, in part because of the impact of competition on her business, but thereafter seeks $1000 net per week to date.
	
	
	Taking into account the plaintiff’s longer periods of part-time employment following the birth of her other children, and the increased strain on the household of having her other children and her husband’s child to look after, as well as allowing for the plaintiff to have some form of capacity for employment during this period, I consider that the allowance of $350 per week for the whole 239 weeks should be made, which would result in a calculation of $350 x 239, which is $83, 650.
	


Past superannuation


	
	Past superannuation, noted in the schedule at 11%, was agreed in submissions to be claimable at 8%. 8% of $83,650 is $6,692.
	


Future economic loss and superannuation


	
	The plaintiff brings a significant claim for future economic loss. Essentially she claims that the impact of her disabilities on her future employment should be assessed at $750 per week (less 15% for vicissitudes) together with superannuation (at the revised figure of 10%) for the rest of her working life to the age of 67, a total of $470,347.
	
	
	Mr Sleight, in addition to his submissions as to the plaintiff’s lack of entitlement to any damages, puts to me that the plaintiff is likely to make a complete recovery from her psychiatric condition, and that I should infer as much, despite there being no actual medical evidence to this effect.
	
	
	The submissions on this issue give rise to a problem frequently encountered in personal injury proceedings. In State of New South Wales v Moss (2000) 54 NSWLR 536 at [87], Heydon JA noted:
	


“[87] … The task of the trier of fact is to form a discretionary judgment by reference to not wholly determinate criteria within fairly wide parameters. Though the trier of fact in arriving at the discretionary judgment must achieve satisfaction that a fair award is being made, since what is involved is not the finding of historical facts on a balance of probabilities, but the assessment of the value of a chance, it is appropriate to take into account a range of possible outcomes even though the likelihood of any particular outcome being achieved may be no more than a real possibility.”


	
	While the plaintiff has ceased to operate her business, she does have a residual working capacity. She has held positions of responsibility and has a good working record. Given her ability to set up a business for herself, she would also be able to work for herself if necessary, which would enable her to tailor her working hours and duties around the physical limitations arising from her ongoing back pain problems. How should these factors be taken into account?
	
	
	Both parties have provided calculations which are at the extreme end of the spectrum. While I have the agreed calculations as to the plaintiff’s earning capacity in her business, this is not the only kind of work the plaintiff can do. With her past work history and training she could perform a wide range of business activities, subject to her ongoing psychiatric and back pain issues.
	
	
	Notwithstanding the difficulties I have in assessing damages for future economic loss, I am required to make an assessment that both identifies and takes account of the different possible outcomes for the plaintiff in pursuing the opportunity to operate her own business, and to adjust the award of damages to reflect that assessment: Verryt v Schoupp (2015) 70 MVR 484 at [76] – [78]. In the present case, that is made much easier because the plaintiff actually was conducting such a business, whereas in Verryt v Schoupp the proposal was a future plan. 
	
	
	The words “must” and “fair”, in the extract of Heydon JA’s judgment in State of New South Wales v Moss set out above, were italicised in the discussion of these principles in Verryt v Schoupp, and stressed as being of paramount importance.
	
	
	In those circumstances, doing the best I can (to paraphrase the words of the test in New South Wales v Moss), I consider that the figure of $350 net per week more accurately reflects the plaintiff’s future economic loss, and that use of this figure as a base, allowing for vicissitudes of 15%, represents a more rational assessment of the degree to which the plaintiff’s disabilities impact upon her employability. The plaintiff would also be entitled to future superannuation at 10% on this sum.
	
	
	The future economic loss sum is thus 737.8 x 350 x 0.85 which is $219,495.50, which for convenience I round up to $219,500.
	
	
	Future loss of superannuation at 10% would be $21,950.
	


The claim for domestic assistance


	
	The plaintiff’s claim for past care is on the basis of 10 hours per week at $26.50 an hour which would allow for “perhaps teenagers doing something – and not many of them do” (T 214). Mr Murko’s evidence was that because of his long hours at work, he would have been doing no housework at the home at all including work outside in the garden.
	
	
	With one exception (discussed in more detail below), this was the extent of the plaintiff’s submissions in relation to past care. The defendants’ submissions (written submissions, paragraphs 69-72) were similarly brief. This brings me to make some general observations as to the difficulties submissions of this kind make for the court. These observations are not critical of counsel in any way; such submissions are generally made in this fashion and, but for the approach taken to these issues by the New South Wales Court of Appeal (most recently in Sampco Pty Ltd v Wurth), would not be made at all.
	
	
	Claims for domestic assistance are often substantial in size. The traditional method of proving a requirement for assistance has been a brief statement (generally provided by an orthopaedic surgeon or a psychiatrist), supplemented by estimates by the plaintiff and on occasion members of the plaintiff’s family as to those household tasks which are performed and the amount of time they take.
	
	
	The adequacy of these methods has been the subject of criticism by the New South Wales Court of Appeal. In Gordon v Truong [2014] NSWCA 97, the Court of Appeal noted at [25] that awarding damages for this head of loss is “anomalous” in that it requires “an assessment of how the plaintiff will cater for his [her] accident-caused disabilities in the future, a matter which is usually irrelevant” and, by inference, in the past. Simpson JA notes at [30]-[31], in relation to future economic loss:
	


“[31] On the facts of that case, the court held it was not appropriate simply to “pluck a figure out of the air because there is a remote, though not entirely fanciful, chance of the need for commercial domestic assistance in the future“: at [24]. In my view, the same conclusion should follow in the present case and the trial judge was correct to refuse to make such an award.

[32] If a different view were taken, a calculation of an award starting immediately and continuing throughout the life expectancy of the plaintiff could not be countenanced consistently with principles identified in Miller. The only approach available is to pluck a figure (to be described as a buffer) out of the air. If that course were to be taken (which I do not favour) the figure should not exceed $40,000. That figure takes into account the likelihood of the plaintiff not obtaining commercial assistance immediately and the likelihood that his other health problems will at some point overwhelm the limited needs assessed as resulting from the accident.”


	
	Macfarlan JA agreed, noting the restrictions in relation to Miller v Galderisi [2009] NSWCA 353 to the facts of individual cases. Basten JA dissented, although noting that Miller v Galderisi was a case “decided on its own facts” (at [128]). His findings at [135] were as follows:
	


“[135] There is no reason to depart from the finding of the primary judge that the plaintiff required domestic assistance between 2 to 4 hours per week. It was not established that that assistance will be provided gratuitously in the future. Section 141B has no application unless that is established. The plaintiff is entitled to an award of damages for domestic assistance at commercial rates for 3 hours per week for the remainder of his life. His life expectancy is 30 years. The commercial rate of assistance is $35 per hour. Applying the appropriate multiplier, the plaintiff claims to be entitled, in addition to the damages awarded, to an award of $86,310 under this head of damages. I would therefore allow the cross-appeal and direct the parties to undertake the necessary calculations to give effect to these conclusions.”


	
	However, in Sampco Pty Ltd v Wurth, the Court of Appeal took a more stringent view as to how evidence of both past and future domestic assistance should be provided, and I have relied heavily upon that decision.
	


Past domestic assistance


	
	The plaintiff did not have time off from her injury in the generally accepted sense, in that she went to hospital the next day for a caesarean operation to be performed. She was unable to drive, and thus, in my view, to work, for six weeks, following which there appears to be a gradual return to work, allowing for such incidental factors as the Christmas and January holiday period. I have noted elsewhere the plaintiff’s references, in the course of her physiotherapy and to Mr Glancey, to have six months off after the birth of her child. Given that there are two independent notes to this effect by persons taking her medical history, I am of the view that I should accept that this was her intention.
	
	
	The plaintiff was receiving physiotherapy for her back throughout the whole of 2011. She refers on occasions when she had felt pain, such as when she leaned into a pram to pick up groceries (20 May) and to ill-health of herself and the baby (e.g. 20 June and 1 August) but not to being unable to perform tasks she had previously been able to perform. Although Dr Sor does not record the plaintiff consulting him on a regular basis about pain issues, reports from Rachael Wiltshire, the physiotherapist, were sent to Dr Sor on 9 May and 8 August 2011, which is suggestive of monitoring of an ongoing problem.
	
	
	Counsel for the defendants pointed to the absence of pain medication over this period of time, although she was taking other drugs such as Ventolin. However, the plaintiff was breastfeeding over this period and her explanation of her reluctance to take painkillers apart from over the counter remedies (the taking of which I note are to be confirmed by the physiotherapist’s notes) is an acceptable one.
	
	
	The plaintiff saw Dr Abi-Hanna on 6 February 2012 about a fall on stairs. She does not refer to her back pain, which Mr Sleight submitted was of significance. However, the plaintiff had seen the physiotherapist only a month previously, on 4 January 2012, and reading between the lines of the notes taken by Ms Wiltshire, her condition remained much the same. The use of words such as “worse” or “stiff throughout” are not suggestive of being injury free.
	
	
	The plaintiff’s medical condition during 2012 is, however, more difficult to determine. She had consulted solicitors and obtained the first of her medico legal reports. The plaintiff was clearly struggling during this period of time. Her expectation that her husband would assist with the housework, her disputes with his son as to his refusal to do the housework, and conflict with her daughters over these issues, is apparent, and appears to have played a role in the plaintiff’s separation from her husband in December 2012. The plaintiff and her husband rented out the matrimonial home, which was subject to a large mortgage, and she moved to Mount Warrigal on the South Coast in order, she said, to be closer to her mother. It is during this period that her health and well-being significantly declined.
	
	
	The plaintiff’s mother was present at the scene of the accident and if her assistance were relied upon in relation to homecare, could have been a witness in the plaintiff’s camp. While Mr Sleight made no Jones v Dunkel application in relation to calling her, I should note that, if he had, may have been a submission of some force.
	
	
	The breakdown of the marriage meant that, for practical purposes, both the plaintiff and her husband had to leave the matrimonial home. It was first rented out and then sold, presumably for the purpose of effecting a settlement of the property issues between the parties for the purposes of the Family Law Act 1975 (Cth). No documents have been tendered in this regard.
	
	
	Varying views have been expressed by medical practitioners as to the plaintiff’s entitlement to domestic assistance. Dr Teoh, who provided a medico legal report on 10 April 2014, stated:
	


“She does not require domestic assistance, although she has required the assistance of her daughter.”


	
	However, Dr Deveridge in his report of 2 April 2015 at page 3 opines:
	


“She requires domestic home care and assistance as detailed above. I consider that this would amount to at least 6 hours a week on a long term basis.”


	
	In Sampco Pty Ltd v Wurth at [83], Basten JA noted, in relation to hourly calculation of this sort:
	


“[83] The judge was entitled to put little, if any, weight upon hourly calculations provided by medical practitioners. No medical practitioner was qualified as expert in assessing the number of hours required for gardening, home maintenance or any other activity which might go into the purported assessment. It is difficult to imagine that the practitioners called in the present case could have been so qualified. No objection was taken to the evidence which was, on its face, inadmissible: however, the mere fact that it was admitted without objection did not require the trial judge to give it any weight at all. The real value of medical evidence in this area is in an assessment of the true extent of any physical or mental disability suffered by the plaintiff. That is because the key question is not what assistance the plaintiff has been provided by others, but the “reasonable need for the services to be provided“.”


	
	Evidence called in these proceedings, from the plaintiff’s daughter and her former husband as well as the plaintiff, shares the same kind of generality as that complained of by Basten JA in Sampco Pty Ltd v Wurth at [84]. Mr Murko’s evidence was that:
	


“I had to come home and do housework. I was probably hard on the girls but I needed them to help me cause [sic] I was doing 50 hours a week [at his paid place of employment]. Yeah, so it was better that we separated cause all we did was argue in front of the kids and‑‑” (T 179)


	
	Prior to that, his marriage had been “heaven from my last marriage cause I didn't have to do anything” (T 177).
	
	
	The plaintiff’s daughter’s evidence was similar imprecise:
	


“Q. I want to ask you some questions about domestic chores, housework, do you understand?

A. (No verbal reply)

Q. When this accident happened of course you were only 12 or 13?

A. Yes.

Q. Did you do anything much by way of domestic chores at home at that time?

A. Clean my room.

Q. After your mother was hurt did anything happen with the amount of domestic chores you had to do at home?

A. Yes.

Q. Tell me what happened?

A. We had to basically do a lot more than what we had to clean the bathrooms, go shopping with mum so she could carry, so we could carry the groceries, we'd help do the lawns. Yeah, bathroom, mopping, vacuuming, dusting.

Q. Anything to do with clothes?

A. We had to wash our own clothes, we were washed our clothes and me and my sister did my mum's.

Q. Did you have a clothesline at the first house that you were living in at Harrington Park?

A. Yes, we did.

Q. Who put the clothes on the line after the washing after your mother hurt herself?

A. Me and my sister.” (T 152)

She said that since having the accident, her mother was “angry all the time” and “depressed” (T 154). In cross-examination, she revealed that there were family disputes and that she had taken on a part time job in order to have more responsibility and earn her own income (T 158). She stated at T 159:

“Q. What you just go to work and leave your mum to do everything would you?

A. Yeah, I would do what my mum's asked me to do but I do a lot more now, ‘cause she can't do it, or she can do it but she's in a lot of pain afterwards.

Q. Well thank you, she can do it but you - even if your mother didn't have this injury, as you got older you'd do more of your own‑‑

A. I couldn’t‑‑

Q. ‑‑domestic tasks, couldn’t you?

A. I couldn't tell you that, no.

Q. Well don't you think it's likely that as you become an adult living in the house, you wouldn't leave everything up to your mum would you?

A. I don't know.” (T 159)


	
	While I have carefully noted the plaintiff’s evidence in relation to her ongoing disabilities during this period of time, the fact remains that she was still able to drive a car and go to work, and that she was still mowing the lawns when she saw Dr Deveridge. Her real problems in performing housework seem to date from what she calls her nervous breakdown in July 2013, following which time she was too depressed to get out of bed, some times for a week or two at a time, rather than simply because of back pain.
	
	
	Noting the criticisms made by Basten JA, and in particular his summary of the requirement of a trial judge to set out matters of the kind identified at [92], I am of the view that the plaintiff in these proceedings cannot establish the requisite six hours of assistance per week for past domestic assistance. This is because:
	



	
	Her evidence of need is limited to “heavier” domestic duties without precise identification of what these were and how long they took (Sampco Pty Ltd v Wurth at [92](a)).
	
	
	As is noted above, the medical reports providing assistance include opinions falling outside the expertise of the medical practitioners (Sampco Pty Ltd v Wurth at [92](b)). Additionally, not only were the defendants’ medico legal experts of the view that the plaintiff did not suffer from an injury requiring assistance but Dr Teoh, the plaintiff’s medico legal expert, was of the view she did not require such assistance.
	
	
	It is important to distinguish between the plaintiff’s back injury and her psychiatric problems. Having regard to Dr Teoh’s considered view, it is difficult to see how the plaintiff’s psychiatric problems can give rise to an injury preventing her from doing housework, particularly prior to July 2013 (Sampco Pty Ltd v Wurth at [92](c)).
	
	
	It is necessary to distinguish between services provided to the plaintiff and general activities of the family, particularly in regard to the likelihood that the plaintiff would not have been expected to do all the housework for some quite long period of time following the birth of her youngest child.
	



	
	Taking all of the above into account, and applying the principles in Sampco Pty Ltd v Wurth, the plaintiff has failed to make good her claim for past domestic assistance.
	


Future domestic assistance


	
	As was the case in Sampco Pty Ltd v Wurth, the plaintiff’s claim for future domestic assistance depends upon satisfying the requirements of which Basten JA calls at [94] “intensity and longevity” as set out in s 15(3) Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW). In other words, they depend upon the same kind of precise evidence as is required for past assistance.
	
	
	In the present case, the plaintiff is in a considerably better position than the plaintiff in Sampco Pty Ltd v Wurth. There can be no doubt that the plaintiff has abandoned and given up her business, but is unable to perform her duties at home, and has arranged for her estranged husband to return to the home to help her.
	
	
	The first issue is whether future domestic assistance is available at a lower rate of hours per week at commercial rates: Miller v Galderisi. The second is whether the plaintiff is able to pass the threshold for future care on a non-commercial basis.
	
	
	Mr Lidden SC elided the two by claiming for eight hours per week future care at $43 per week totalling $326,937. He conceded, however, that this would be the amount to be awarded only if that future care were paid. If the future care is gratuitous, it should be costed at a figure of $27.96 per hour, a sum which I was left to do.
	
	
	Part of the problem is what to make of the fact that the plaintiff is currently being assisted by her former husband who has returned home to live (with the knowledge and permission of Centrelink). This is something of a grey area in relation to future home assistance. Clearly, Mr Murko is unlikely to wish to remain living with his former wife on any long-term basis and, equally clearly, the assistance he provides in his capacity as her former husband is not the same as that of a person who is tied to the plaintiff by obligations of family or even kinship.
	
	
	Mr Murko’s evidence is that he has a busy working week, and I accept this, in that he is employed full time, often working 50 hours per week. Nevertheless, the amount of assistance he is likely to provide in the future, in the form of the hours of work, or even how long he will remain living with her, is unknown.
	
	
	As is noted above, the plaintiff’s daughter’s evidence is similarly limited. She and the plaintiff both say there are days when the plaintiff cannot get out of bed, and that she requires assistance with a range of tasks, but without the precision required. In Sampco Pty Ltd v Wurth, Basten JA notes, in relation to such evidence, at [99]:
	


“[99] There is a question as to whether the trial judge was correct to deal with the matter on the basis of likelihood, if by that it was intended to refer to probability. The judge referred to the decision of this court in Miller v Galderisi at [15]. That paragraph merely referred to the absence of evidence that the gratuitous assistance then being provided would cease at some time in the future. The court also said:

The evidence accepted by the primary judge [as] the additional domestic assistance required as a result of the accident, assessed at four hours per week, was, since the accident and at the time of trial, being provided by the respondent’s wife with limited assistance from his son. Whether that assistance would continue to be provided by them on a gratuitous basis was a factor which the primary judge was entitled to take into account. If that circumstance were to change in the future, domestic assistance would, foreseeably, be required from a commercial provider. However, that expense was neither immediate nor inevitable. No doubt the likelihood of the contingency would increase with time, but other factors would have a contrary tendency.”


	
	In addition to these problems, there are the problems identified by Basten JA at [100]:
	


“[100] The other variables included the plaintiff’s life expectancy, his pre-accident medical conditions, the disabilities resulting from the pre-existing conditions, the need for assistance resulting from age alone and the circumstances of the primary carer, his wife. The court then addressed the question as to how these factors might be assessed by reference to the principles derived from Malec, noting that “the exercise is better described as a form of speculation guided by knowledge of the plaintiff’s past and expectations, derived from general experience, as to the future.”


	
	Unlike Sampco Pty Ltd v Wurth, the present case is run on the basis that there will be likely to be a change in circumstances where gratuitous assistance will cease and commercial assistance will be required. However, when this occurs and what is involved involves speculation as to future events in what Basten JA calls “foreseeable but unpredictable circumstances” (at [102]).
	
	
	Ultimately, however, the plaintiff’s evidence on this issue is as unsatisfactory as that of Mrs Wurth (as set out at [104] and [105] of Basten JA’s decision). There is no doubt that the decision of Sampco Pty Ltd v Wurth raises the bar significantly in relation to requiring expert, detailed and precise evidence as to claims for past and future care. I understand an application for leave to appeal to the High Court will be made, but I am bound by stare decisis principles to require the kind of precise evidence Basten JA identifies as necessary to be given, as to both the tasks involved and the hours, which should preferably supported by a report from a qualified person rather than brief statements in medico legal reports for which the reasoning is not exposed. The claim for future care accordingly has not been made out.
	
	
	Mr Sleight draws my attention to Metaxoulis v McDonalds Australia Ltd [2015] NSWCA 95 at [81] in relation to the vicissitudes of the normal ageing process. In view of my rejection of the plaintiff’s claim for future care it is not necessary for me to deal with this issue, but I note the applicability of such principles in future care claims generally will result in significantly reduced claims, even where (unlike the facts in that case) there is no other cause of injury to take into account.

2703185,Environment Protection Authority v Riverina Australia Pty Ltd [2015] NSWCCA 165,"Judgment


	
	HOEBEN CJ at CL: I agree with Hall J.
	
	
	HALL J:
	


Background


	
	The Environment Protection Authority (the Prosecutor/Appellant – “EPA”) commenced proceedings in the Land and Environment Court of NSW (“LEC”) (Class 5) by way of Summons filed on 17 April 2014 wherein the defendant, Riverina (Australia) Pty Ltd (“Riverina”) was charged that, on or about 22 April 2013, at or near Casino in the State of New South Wales, it committed an offence against s 120(1) of the Protection of the Environment Operations Act 1997 (NSW) (the “PoEO Act”) in that it polluted waters. The charge concerns an allegation that, on or about the last mentioned date, Riverina disposed of waste material (consisting inter alia of tallow, fats and oils) by sending it down stormwater drains from which point it washed down a number of drainage lines and into waters.
	
	
	At the hearing, which commenced on 1 December 2014, Riverina argued, as a preliminary point, that the Summons was duplicitous. The LEC (Pepper J) held on 5 December 2014 that the Summons was bad for duplicity: Environment Protection Authority v Riverina (Australia) Pty Ltd [2014] NSWLEC 190. Her Honour required the prosecution to elect to, “… remove the embarrassment” as otherwise the Summons would be struck out: Judgment of the LEC at [4].
	
	
	At the request of the EPA the primary judge stated two questions to be referred for this Court’s determination. The proceedings in the LEC have been stayed pending a determination by this Court.
	
	
	The two questions of law that have been submitted for this Court’s determination pursuant to s 5AE of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 are:
	


Question 1:   Whether the Court erred in finding that the summons filed on 17 April 2014 was bad for duplicity because more than one offence had been charged in the one count of contravention of s 120(1) of the PoEO Act.

Question 2:   Whether, upon its proper construction, s 257 of the PoEO Act obviates the need for the Prosecutor to provide the defendant with the essential details of the particular act, matter or thing alleged as the foundation of the manner of contravention of s 120(1) of the PoEO Act contained in paragraph 1(c)(i) of the Summons.

Statutory Provisions


	
	Chapter 5 of the PoEO Act is entitled “Environment Protection Offences” and consists of ss 114‑170. That Chapter creates a number of offences for the protection of the environment. Section 120 prohibits the pollution of waters. It is expressed in quite general terms. Whilst the pollution of waters may arise from a number of circumstances in different ways, the Act creates one general offence of “Water Pollution” in Part 5.3 of Chapter 5.
	
	
	Section 120 of the PoEO Act, which creates an offence of strict liability in respect of the pollution of waters, is in the following terms:
	


“120 Prohibition of pollution of waters

(1)   A person who pollutes any waters is guilty of an offence.

…

(2)   In this section:

‘pollute’ waters includes cause or permit any waters to be polluted.”


	
	Section 257, which is in Part 8.5 of the Act, entitled “Evidentiary Provisions,” provides:
	


“257 Occupier of premises responsible for pollution from premises

(1)   In any proceedings under this Act, the occupier of premises at or from which any pollution occurs is taken to have caused the pollution, unless it is established that:

(a)   the pollution was caused by another person, and

(b)   the other person was not associated with the occupier at the time the pollution occurred, and

(c)   the occupier took all reasonable steps to prevent the pollution.

A person is associated with the occupier for the purposes of paragraph (b) (but without limiting any other circumstances of association) if the person is an employee, agent, licensee, contractor or sub-contractor of the occupier.

(2)   Subsection (1) does not prevent proceedings being taken under this Act against the person who actually caused the pollution.”


	
	Before proceeding to examine the judgment of the court below and the questions of law referred for determination pursuant to s 5AE of the Criminal Appeal Act it is necessary to set out the particulars of the charge in the Summons and in the Letter of Particulars dated 2 June 2014.
	


Particulars in the Summons


	
	The application made by Riverina in the LEC focused upon the “Particulars” set out in paragraph 1(a), (b) and (c) of the Summons, details of which are set out in paragraph [12] below. The EPA also relied upon particulars that were provided by them to the respondent in a letter dated 2 June 2014, the terms of which are also set out below.
	
	
	In support of the offence charged under s 120(1) of the PoEO Act charging Riverina with having “polluted waters” the following particulars were set out in the Summons:
	


“1.   …

Particulars

a.   Waters:

A drain running along the western side of Reynolds Road, Casino, which flows into a drainage channel running through the property known as “San Marla” immediately to the east of Reynolds Road, Casino then to wetlands and downstream thereof.

b.   Pollutant:

Matter comprising or containing:

(i)   animal and vegetable fats and oils, and/or

(ii)   aluminium, barium, calcium, chromium, cobalt, copper, iron, magnesium, manganese, molybdenum, nickel, vanadium and zinc, and/or

(iii)   matter that causes biochemical or chemical oxygen demand, and/or

(iv)   liquid that contains suspended or dissolved solids, and/or

(v)   matter that has a pH value of less than 6.5

c.    Manner of Contravention:

(i)    The defendant was the occupier of the premises at Lot 101 Reynolds Road, Casino, known as “Riverina Stock Feeds” (the Premises), at or from which which (sic) pollution occurred; and/or

(ii)    The defendant placed the Pollutant in a drain used or designed to receive or pass rainwater, by placing the Pollutant into the stormwater drains leading from the Premises; and/or

(iii)   The defendant placed the Pollutant in a position where it was likely to fall, descend or be washed into the Waters.

…”

Letter of Particulars


	
	The letter of 2 June 2014 was in response to a request for particulars on behalf of Riverina dated 15 May 2014. The Principal Legal Officer of the Office of Environment & Heritage wrote to Riverina’s solicitors stating, in part:
	


“I refer to your letter dated 15 May 2014.

In respect of the particulars in the Summons under the heading ‘Manner of contravention’, the Prosecutor relies on paragraphs (ii) and (iii) only in the alternative to particular (i). In respect of paragraph (i), the Prosecutor relies on s 257 of the Protection of the Environment Operations Act 1997 (the Act) to establish that the pollution was caused by the Defendant, by virtue of the Defendant being the occupier of the Premises.

In answer to the specific questions in your letter:

1.   Into which drain/s on the Premises does the prosecutor allege the defendant placed the Pollutant in paragraph 1(c)(ii)? There are numerous stormwater drains on the premises.

The Defendant placed the Pollutant into the drain leading from the Liquid Raw Material Bund and the drain or drains into which that drain flowed.

2.   How and in what manner does the prosecutor allege that the defendant placed the Pollutant into those drain/s?

The Judgment of the Land and Environment Court


	
	Pepper J in her judgment delivered on 5 December 2014, set out the relevant provisions of s 120 and s 257 of the PoEO Act and noted that the term “water pollution” was broadly defined in the dictionary to the Act to mean:
	


“water pollution or pollution of waters means:

(a)   placing in or on, or otherwise introducing into or onto, waters (whether through an act or omission) any matter, whether solid, liquid or gaseous, so that the physical, chemical or biological condition of the waters is changed, or

(b)   placing in or on, or otherwise introducing into or onto, the waters (whether through an act or omission) any refuse, litter, debris or other matter, whether solid or liquid or gaseous, so that the change in the condition of the waters or the refuse, litter, debris or other matter, either alone or together with any other refuse, litter, debris or matter present in the waters makes, or is likely to make, the waters unclean, noxious, poisonous or impure, detrimental to the health, safety, welfare or property of persons, undrinkable for farm animals, poisonous or harmful to aquatic life, animals, birds or fish in or around the waters or unsuitable for use in irrigation, or obstructs or interferes with, or is likely to obstruct or interfere with persons in the exercise or enjoyment of any right in relation to the waters, or

(c)   placing in or on, or otherwise introducing into or onto, the waters (whether through an act or omission) any matter, whether solid, liquid or gaseous, that is of a prescribed nature, description or class or that does not comply with any standard prescribed in respect of that matter,

and, without affecting the generality of the foregoing, includes:

(d)   placing any matter (whether solid, liquid or gaseous) in a position where:

(i)   it falls, descends, is washed, is blown or percolates, or

(ii)   it is likely to fall, descend, be washed, be blown or percolate,

into any waters, onto the dry bed of any waters, or into any drain, channel or gutter used or designed to receive or pass rainwater, floodwater or any water that is not polluted, or

(e)   placing any such matter on the dry bed of any waters, or in any drain, channel or gutter used or designed to receive or pass rainwater, floodwater or any water that is not polluted,

if the matter would, had it been placed in any waters, have polluted or have been likely to pollute those waters.”


	
	Her Honour identified the elements of an offence against s 120 as:
	


“(a)   the act of polluting, by the action of placing or introducing;

(b)   a prescribed matter, as defined in the Act and the Regulations;

(c)   into waters; and

(d)   by a person.""


	
	Pepper J noted that s 120 was a “result offence”, the consequence of the pollution of waters being a necessary element of the offence.
	
	
	The issues that arose on Riverina’s application to the primary judge are dealt with under two subheadings in her Honour’s judgment, namely, “Is the Manner of Contravention Duplicitous? (at [42]-[46]) and “Is there Additional Latent Duplicity in the Particularisation of the ‘Pollutant’?”
	
	
	Her Honour observed that it was the EPA’s contention that there was no duplicity, patent or latent, arising in respect of the Summons with respect either to the particularisation of the term “pollutant”, or the “manner of contravention” of s 120 of the PoEO Act: Judgment of the LEC at [50].
	
	
	As to the first issue, her Honour noted the EPA’s submission that particular 1(c)(i) of the Summons merely prescribed another basis of legal liability grounding Riverina’s breach of s 120 pursuant to s 257 of the Act and that this was not duplicitous. The EPA argued that this was because s 257 obviated a need for the Authority to prove “how and who caused [the pollutant] to escape” and therefore the need to particularise factual elements. On this line of argument, her Honour noted, if the EPA could not prove to the criminal standard the more particular unlawful act specified in 1(c)(ii) and (iii), it proceeded upon this basis that it could rely on what was referred to as the “deeming provision” in s 257 to merely prove, without more, that a polluting act occurred at or from Riverina’s premises.
	
	
	Her Honour, in rejecting the EPA’s submission stated that reliance by it on s 257 was “misconceived”: Judgment of the LEC at [55]. That provision did not by its language abrogate a prosecutor’s obligation to disclose the “particular act, matter or thing alleged as the foundation of the charge.”
	
	
	Her Honour observed that, given the fundamental nature of the common law right of a defendant to know not only the legal nature of the offence with which he or she is being charged, but also the basal factual elements of the offence, it must be presumed that had Parliament intended by the enactment of s 257 to circumscribe this right in the manner submitted by the EPA, Parliament would have done so by express statutory language or necessary intendment: Judgment of the LEC at [56].
	
	
	Her Honour held that s 257 of the Act was no more than a device attributing the criminal liability of third parties to occupiers of premises: Judgment of the LEC at [57].
	
	
	In the prosecution by the EPA of Riverina, no details had been given for the purposes of Particular 1(c)(i) of either when (other than sometime on or about 22 April 2013), from where or how the pollutant escaped Riverina’s premises. In such circumstances her Honour held s 257 “… will provide cold comfort to the EPA; it cannot cure the defects in the summons in relation to this separately alleged manner of contravention of s 120 of the Act …”: Judgment of the LEC at [64].
	
	
	Her Honour further stated that the construction contended for by the EPA of s 257 would make it extremely difficult, if not impossible, for a defendant to avail himself or herself of the defences contained in s 257(1)(a)-(c) (or any common law defences), such as honest and reasonable mistake of fact: Judgment of the LEC at [65].
	
	
	Next, her Honour stated that it was no answer to say, as the EPA did, that because s 120 was a “result based offence”, it was sufficient merely to particularise that pollution occurred at the specified waters (“the result”) at or from Riverina’s premises where Riverina was the occupier of those premises. Her Honour observed at [66]:
	


“… to do so ignores the conduct upon which the consequence is founded – the conduct being an element of the offence that the EPA must prove beyond reasonable doubt – and about which sufficient particulars are necessary.”


	
	Her Honour held that Riverina was entitled to be apprised, as a matter of fairness, of the location and the method by which the pollutant is said to have entered the specified waters with respect to the manner of contravention alleged in paragraph 1(c)(i): Judgment of the LEC at [68].
	
	
	In relation to the particularisation of the “pollutant”, her Honour considered that evidence in the proceedings of EPA officers (Mr Cramb and Mr Greenback) provided some support for the fact that it was conceivable, if not likely, that pollution had arisen from more than one source and not merely that as alleged at the “Bund”. In that respect, her Honour stated the evidence rendered it conceivable, if not likely, that the manner of contravention envisaged by the EPA in paragraph 1(c)(i) of the Summons was a consequence of a separate act of pollution to that alleged to have occurred at the Bund, occurring at another location on the premises, and at a different time on or about 22 April 2013. Evidence of Mr Cramb and Mr Greenback is discussed at [88]‑[89] below.
	
	
	The EPA, her Honour noted, did not rely on any criminal enterprise allegation against Riverina. Additionally, the evidence demonstrated that some of the matters said to have comprised the “pollutant” were stored and used at different locations on Riverina’s premises: Judgment of the LEC at [70].
	
	
	Her Honour concluded that the Summons, as framed, did more than permissibly state alternative or cumulative allegations in respect of the result: EPA v Brazel (No 2) [2002] NSWLEC 26 at [7]; CSR Limited v Environmental Protection Authority [2000] NSWCCA 373; (2000) 110 LGERA 334 at [34]. Her Honour noted, to the contrary, that having regard to the particulars as confirmed in the letter of 2 June 2014, “… the summons alleges wholly separate and discrete acts in respect of the pollution of the specified waters”: Judgment of the LEC at [71].
	
	
	Her Honour noted that in Brazel (No 2), a single act of placing pesticide into holes drilled into a cement floor (which then fell into the street gutter and ultimately made its way to the creek) was alleged to have given rise to actual or likely pollution within the one count. In that case, there was one act of contravention of s 120 of the PoEO Act which had the occurrence of two consequences. That was not duplicitous. However, her Honour distinguished that from the present case, noting at [72]:
	


“… but in the present case, there are two acts of contravention particularised, with the occurrence of two certain consequences.”


	
	Her Honour observed that it was the “Manner of Contravention” issue which the debate on duplicity centred upon rather than the respondent’s allegation of duplicity in the particularisation of the “pollutant”: Judgment of the LEC at [42]. The manner in which the appellant had particularised the “pollutant”, in her Honour’s opinion, would not of itself give rise to duplicity in the summons, but was problematic in the context of the summons as a whole: Judgment of the LEC at [53].
	
	
	Her Honour accordingly concluded that the Summons was bad for duplicity, observing that it was either patently duplicitous insofar as it alleged two separate contraventions of s 120, or was latently ambiguous insofar as it failed to provide the essential matters of fact giving rise to the criminal liability with which Riverina had been charged, or it is both: Judgment of the LEC at [74].
	


Submissions

(a) Submissions of the Appellant/Prosecutor (EPA)


	
	It was submitted for the EPA that the construction of s 257 was integral to both questions 1 and 2 referred to this Court. However, a preliminary question in the proceedings concerned the nature of an offence pursuant to s 120: Appellant’s Written Submissions at [25].
	
	
	Riverina, it was submitted, had been charged by the Summons with one offence. As noted above, it was contended that the particulars set out “a number of alternatives”. These alternatives, it was contended, went to the matter of proof and not to the occurrence of the offence: Appellant’s Written Submissions at [27]. It was argued in this respect that the offence occurred on or about the date charged and was to be seen as one act or set of acts by which the water was polluted. The particulars did not constitute particulars of different charges: Appellant’s Written Submissions at [27].
	
	
	The particulars, it was further submitted, did not concern “separate and distinct failures”: Appellant’s Written Submissions at [28].
	
	
	The EPA observed that s 120 is a “result offence”: Brownlie v State Pollution Control Commission (1992) 27 NSWLR 78 and Environment Protection Authority v Bathurst City Council (1995) 89 LGERA 79. This, it was submitted, is a necessary element of the offence and is the focal point of the legislature’s concern with the conduct in question: Appellant’s Written Submissions at [37].
	
	
	The “result” of the offence alleged in this case was said to be the fact of pollution of waters, as extensively defined, including those matters prescribed by Schedule 5 of the Protection of the Environment Operations (General) Regulation 2009. That Regulation, for the purposes of paragraph (c) of the definition of water pollution in the Dictionary to the Act, defines “matter” in terms of paragraphs (a) to (w) therein set out. The fact that the definitions are extensive, it was argued, does not result in a separate offence. It was contended that as soon as one or other of the various defined terms is established, the offence is complete: Appellant’s Written Submissions at [38].
	
	
	It was submitted that there is no duplicity where the results that are proven all arise as a consequence of the same criminal activity, namely, water pollution within the meaning of the expanded definition: Appellant’s Written Submissions at [39].
	
	
	It was submitted that, as in Walsh v Tattersall (1996) 188 CLR 77, although a charge is evidenced by multiple acts, nonetheless these acts may be said to represent a single crime, in which case a single count is therefore permissible: Appellant’s Written Submissions at [32] and [36].
	
	
	It was argued that the EPA merely relied upon two different ways of proving one offence. The first included calling evidence as to Riverina placing the pollutant in a rainwater drain, and/or placing the pollutant in a position where it was likely to fall, descend or be washed into the waters (particulars 1(c)(ii) and/or (iii)). The second was reliance by the EPA on s 257, which required it to prove that pollution occurred at or from premises. Once that was established the statutory presumption applies: Appellant’s Written Submissions at [42].
	
	
	In the present proceedings then, the EPA, it was submitted, simply relied on s 257 as one of two ways of proving the s 120 offence: Appellant’s Written Submissions at [46].
	
	
	In relation to the allegation that the particularisation of the “pollutant” gave rise to duplicity of itself, the appellant had submitted below that:
	


“The offence crystallised upon the waters being polluted by the prescribed matter, however constituted. Riverina was not being charged with multiple acts of pollution by a myriad of different substances, and in any event, alternative or cumulative allegations in respect of the result do not, in the Court’s opinion, render the charge bad for uncertainty or duplicity (Environment Protection Authority v Brazel (No 2) [2002] NSWLEC 26 at [9] and Environment Protection Authority v Brazel [2002] NSWLEC 7 at [43])”: Judgment of Pepper J at [51].


	
	In this Court it was submitted that the fact that the definitions of “pollutant” are extensive does not result in a separate offence, with reliance placed upon dicta in EPA v Brazel (No 2), and, again, that there was no duplicity where the results proven all arise from the same criminal activity.
	
	
	As to Question 2, the proper construction of s 257, in its Written Submissions, the EPA challenged the primary judge’s construction of s 257 contending that her Honour’s construction was based on the following three conclusions:
	



	
	That s 257 was no more than a device attributing the liability of third parties to occupiers of premises, it being a provision directed at the identity of the offender and concerns vicarious liability: Judgment of the LEC at [57].
	
	
	Without details as to the purpose of Particular 1(c)(i) (that is, for the purpose of s 257) of when, from where, or how, the pollutant escaped Riverina’s premises, s 257 will “provide cold comfort to the EPA” and cannot cure the defects in the Summons. Her Honour noted that were it otherwise the word “from” in s 257, “… would be rendered otiose”: Judgment of the LEC at [64].
	
	
	If s 257 was construed as the EPA contended, it would be extremely difficult, if not impossible, for the defendant to avail itself of any statutory or common law defences: Judgment of the LEC at [65]. This was because the Summons alleges wholly separate and discrete acts of pollution of the specified waters: Judgment of the LEC at [71].
	



	
	In relation to the first point above, it was submitted by the appellant that there was nothing in the Act, in particular in the provisions of s 120 or s 257 which justified such a restrictive reading of s 257. The effect of s 257, it was argued, was that once pollution occurs either at or from premises, the occupier of the premises is taken to have caused the pollution. The occupier then has a legal onus. The section was not merely directed to the identity of the offender, but also was directed to criminal responsibility and the onus of proof.
	
	
	In respect of the second point, it was contended that her Honour’s reasoning was “infected by a misunderstanding of s 257”: Appellant’s Written Submissions at [62]. It was submitted that in order for the presumption to be enlivened, pollution must have occurred “at or from” premises. Pollution can occur either at or from premises and there was no basis on which the word “from” could be said to be otiose. It was submitted that there was no basis to complain that the Summons insufficiently particularised the timing of the offence, that is, “on or about 22 April 2013”.
	
	
	As to how the pollution escaped the premises, it was submitted that there was no defect in the Summons insofar as s 257 was relied upon. The provision simply requires that there be “an occurrence of pollution from the premises”. Once that is established the section is enlivened. Nothing in the words of s 257 that requires any detailing of how the pollution escaped the premises to be particularised. The section did not require the location of the pollution’s escape to be particularised: Appellant’s Written Submissions at [63].
	
	
	The EPA submitted that her Honour erred in concluding that the decision in Newcastle City Council v Pace Farm Egg Products Pty Ltd (No 2) [2005] NSWLEC 241; 141 LGERA 133 did not assist the EPA. Reference in that respect was made to parts of the decision in that case of Pain J at [151]-[152].
	
	
	Finally, in respect of the primary judge’s third reason (abovementioned) in relation to her construction of s 257, namely that it would be difficult if not impossible for the defendant to avail itself of available defences, that statement was said to be based upon a contention that the Summons alleged wholly separate and discrete acts of pollution in the specified waters. It was said that the reasoning in this respect was circular: Appellant’s Written Submissions at [67]. And in any event it was submitted the foundation for the reasoning was flawed. The difficulty or otherwise of proving the defence it was submitted, was not a valid basis on which to interpret the provisions of s 257.
	
	
	In relation to the proper construction of s 257, it was noted that the expression “is taken to have” creates a presumption that the occupier of premises caused the pollution, rebuttable if the statutory defence set out in s 257(1)(a)-(c) is established: Appellant’s Written Submissions at [49].
	
	
	It was further submitted that s 257 permitted the EPA to prove that Riverina, as the occupier of the premises, caused pollution provided that the EPA could separately prove that pollution occurred from those premises: Appellant’s Written Submissions at [51].
	
	
	It was observed that s 257 creates no new offence. It simply creates a new way in which s 120 can be made out. The section was concerned with how an offence charged is to be proved: Appellant’s Written Submissions at [30]-[41]. It was submitted that the primary judge erred in her conclusion that the EPA’s reliance on s 257 amounted to a separate manner of contravention of s 120: Appellant’s Written Submissions at [51].
	
	
	The purpose and effect of s 257 was its operation as an evidentiary provision which is only enlivened by attachment to a substantive offence provision. Once enlivened, it was said to impose a legal burden of proof on the accused rather than just an evidentiary burden. A purpose of s 257 was directed at overcoming difficulties of proof. In the present case the difficulty overcome by the provision was that of proving who had caused pollution where the pollution occurs at or from premises: Appellant’s Written Submissions at [53].
	


(b) Submissions for the Respondent (Riverina)


	
	Mr Ireland in his submissions, supporting the judgment of the primary judge, contended:
	



	
	That the judgment correctly applied the law on duplicity in particular, in accordance with relevant principles as enunciated in Environment Protection Authority v Truegain Pty Ltd [2013] NSWCCA 204; (2013) 85 NSWLR 125 and was unaffected by error;
	
	
	That the judgment applied the law requiring a defendant to be provided with the essential factual particulars of the act, matter or thing said to constitute the offence the subject of the charge: Respondent’s Written Submissions at [3].
	



	
	A primary matter argued in the Court below was said to be that the Summons, when read with the particulars provided in the letter of 2 June 2014, did not merely charge one offence and penalise one act which possessed one or more forbidden characteristics, but instead it (impermissibly) contained a number of different charges arising from different factual circumstances rolled up in the one count in the Summons: Respondent’s Written Submissions at [4].
	
	
	It was argued for Riverina that the duplicity of the Summons arises chiefly from the particulars given of the “manner of contravention” in the charge and is compounded by the particularisation of the “Pollutant” (although it was submitted to the primary judge and in this Court that the duplicity exists regardless of the latter additional factor): Respondent’s Written Submissions at [6].
	
	
	It was observed that the Letter of Particulars of 2 June 2014 provided further particulars in relation to paragraphs 1(c)(ii) and (iii) of the Summons, but no particulars were provided by the letter in relation to paragraph 1(c)(i) of the Summons. All that was said in relation to the latter was that that manner of contravention was relied on in the alternative to 1(c)(ii) and (iii), and that “in respect of paragraph (i), the Prosecutor relies on s 257 of the PoEO Act 1997 to establish that the pollution was caused by the Defendant, by virtue of the Defendant being the occupier of the Premises”.
	
	
	It was submitted that the inadequacy and duplicity of the charge was accordingly readily apparent. By the particulars in relation to 1c(ii) and (iii) the prosecutor was alleging that the defendant placed “the pollutant” into a specific drain, namely, “into the drain leading from the Liquid Raw Material Bund (LRMB) and the drain or drains into which that drain flowed”. It was observed that subparagraphs 1c(ii) and (iii) articulated a properly particularised alleged “manner of contravention” which alleged, when read with the definition of “Pollutant” and “Waters”, a particular “act of pollution” said to constitute the offence charged: Respondent’s Written Submissions at [9].
	
	
	The problem with the Summons, however, was said to arise from the prosecution’s stipulation that it relies on the alleged manner of contravention in 1(c)(i) in the alternative, with the prosecutor declining in its letter of particulars of 2 June 2014 and at the hearing in the LEC, to confine subparagraph 1(c)(i) to the same manner of contravention as particularised in 1(c)(ii) and (iii): at [10].
	
	
	The problem with paragraph 1(c)(i) was said to be that the paragraph in itself suggests various “manners of contravention” distinct from that particularised in 1(c)(ii) and (iii). In addition when 1(c)(i) is read with 1(c)(ii) and (iii), or alone, subparagraph 1(c)(i) must leave the defendant in “unresolved doubt” as to the alleged “manner of contravention” and as to the very act of pollution the subject of the charge: Respondent’s Written Submissions at [11].
	
	
	It was observed in the Respondent’s Written Submissions that if the prosecutor had been content to limit the act of pollution in relation to particular 1(c)(i) to that particularised in respect of 1(c)(ii) and (iii), namely placement in the LRMB then no issue would arise:
	


“…

But by refusing to do this in its letter of 2 June 2014, the Prosecutor is including in the charge a universe or class or other ‘acts of pollution’ occurring through various unspecified and unparticularised ‘manners of contravention’.: at [12].


	
	It was further submitted that the prosecutor had failed to particularise the act of pollution relied upon through the words “at and from which the pollution occurred” in 1(c)(i), and missed the point in its letter of particulars and argument below and to this Court by then invoking s 257: Respondent’s Written Submissions at [13].
	
	
	In relation to s 257, a primary submission made on behalf of Riverina was that the section does not permit a Prosecutor to refrain from giving adequate particulars or providing the essential factual particulars of the act, matter or thing said to constitute the offence. In relation to an offence against s 120 of the PoEO Act, an act of pollution must be relied on and established to make out that offence: Respondent’s Written Submissions at [14].
	
	
	The obligation upon the Prosecutor to provide particulars it was submitted exists and is not displaced or removed by s 257: Respondent’s Written Submissions at [15].
	
	
	The substance of the charge against s 120 was said to be an “act of pollution”. Particularisation of “waters” and “pollutant” accordingly was said to be insufficient to describe the act of pollution: Respondent’s Written Submissions at [18].
	
	
	Without further particulars the defendant it was submitted, was in the position of not knowing whether the charged act involves placing a prescribed matter in waters or placing any matter in a position where it is likely to fall or descend or be washed or blown or percolated into any waters: Respondent’s Written Submissions at [16].
	
	
	More specifically, in relation to Question 1, it was noted that the expression “water pollution” is defined in the Dictionary to the Act in terms of:
	


“(a)   placing in or on, otherwise introducing into or onto, waters (whether through act or omission) any matter …” (emphasis added)


	
	It was not merely the presence of pollutant in waters “but conduct being the act of placing it there (or introducing it into or onto or placing it in a position from where it was likely to get into the waters …”. Respondent’s Written Submissions at [22].
	
	
	The duplicity in the Summons as particularised, it was submitted, arises from the fact of charging multiple unlawful acts of pollution, each an alleged offence against s 120: Respondent’s Written Submissions at [24], referring to Walsh v Tattersall, supra.
	
	
	To merely allege an act of pollution “at and from” the Premises as stated in para 1(c)(i) was manifestly inadequate, there being many drains, plant where ingredients are used, a large hardstand area and multiple sheds on the premises: Respondent’s Written Submissions at [28].
	
	
	Additionally, “Pollution of waters” must involve movement of water from the Premises into “waters”. It was submitted that the prosecutor was simply relying upon pollution “at and from the Premises”: Respondent’s Written Submissions at [31].
	
	
	As in Johnson v Miller (1937) 59 CLR 467, s 120, it was argued, creates a separate offence for each particularised act of pollution. The Summons is defective for duplicity in setting out two offences (at least) based on alternative factual bases of liability, which could not be said to be merely alternative formulations based on substantially the same facts: Respondent’s Written Submissions at [40].
	
	
	As to Question 2, it was submitted by the respondent that s 257 obviates the need to prove the particular defendant caused or was the actor in the “act of pollution” at the Premises but does not purport to obviate the need to particularise and prove the act of pollution at the Premises: Respondent’s Written Submissions at [48].
	
	
	The principle as to the provision of particulars of a charge stand notwithstanding s 257. The section facilitates proof of causation but does not exonerate a prosecutor from proving anything more than “pollutant” in “the waters”. Further, s 257 does not alter the legal elements of the s 120 offence: Respondent’s Written Submissions at [54].
	
	
	In the respondent’s submission, there is an evident purpose behind s 257. It addresses the mischief of a defendant escaping liability where their personal involvement cannot be proved: Respondent’s Written Submissions at [50].
	
	
	In order for s 257 to have operation, a particular act of pollution of waters at and from the Premises must be charged, alleged and proved: Respondent’s Written Submissions at [59].
	
	
	It was submitted that whatever the act or acts of pollution polluting the waters may have been intended as the subject of particular 1(c)(i), that paragraph provides no particulars of any movement of the pollutant from the premises. In maintaining paragraph 1(c)(i) as a strict alternative to paragraph 1(c)(ii) and 1(c)(iii), the Summons in effect alleges another manner of contravention as contemplated by the prosecutor other than that the subject of the last two-mentioned subparagraphs: Respondent’s Written Submissions at [63].
	
	
	Reliance was placed upon the decision of Pain J at [87] in Newcastle City Council v Pace Farm Egg Products Pty Ltd (No 2) [2005] NSWLEC 241; (2005) 141 LGERA 133 for the proposition that s 257 does not overcome the necessity for the prosecutor to prove its case that the pollutant fell or descended into the relevant waters to the required standard of proof: Respondent’s Written Submissions at [64].
	
	
	It was submitted that the defence provisions in s 257 themselves suggest that a defendant must be informed of the act of pollution to be relied upon by the prosecutor: Respondent’s Written Submissions at [72].
	
	
	It was further submitted that paragraph 1(c)(i), when considered in the context of paragraph 1 of the Summons, asserts a potentially limitless class of separate acts (not identified) causing water pollution: Respondent’s Written Submissions at [78].
	
	
	In relation to what the respondent perceived as an implicit submission in the Appellant’s Written Submissions that the conduct alleged in subparagraphs 1(c)(i) and (ii)/(iii) may be viewed as part of the same transaction or criminal enterprise, it was submitted by the respondent that this was quite contrary to concessions recorded as made by counsel for the prosecutor in the court below, including the way in which the case was presented below and the absence of any such allegation in the Summons. It was submitted that the prosecutor ought not be permitted to depart from such concessions and change the case in its fundamentals on the appeal. Reference was made to the transcript (T 25.25-50, T 26.26-38, T 80.36-37 and T 88.29-36): Respondent’s Written Submissions at [79].
	
	
	It was submitted that, contrary to the prosecutor’s submissions, the decision of the High Court in Johnson v Miller was “on all fours with the present case”: Respondent’s Written Submissions at [81].
	
	
	In relation to the prosecutor’s reliance upon the decision in Brazel (No 1) and Brazel (No 2), it was noted that the water pollution arose in those cases from one factual situation or act or placement of an anti-termite chemical in holes drilled in a concrete slab as well as both actual and deemed pollution. The Court in that case found that the actual pollution was not proved by deemed pollution, though it arose from one act. The prosecutor’s difficulty, it was contended, in the present case was that reliance was placed on more than one act of pollution unlike in Brazel: Respondent’s Written Submissions at [83].
	
	
	It was further noted that in the decision of Brazel (No 2) the Court had rejected the defendant’s submission that a separate charge or summons was required for each factual consequence of the one act of placing the pollutant: Respondent’s Written Submissions at [84].
	


Factual Matters


	
	The question as to a requirement on the appellant/prosecutor to provide particulars is to be considered against the background of relevant factual matters concerning Riverina’s premises, being a stock feed manufacturing mill. As discussed below, the primary judge in her judgment, and the respondent in its submissions in this Court, pointed to the possibility, if not the likelihood, of pollution occurring in more than one location having regard to the nature of operations and processes carried on at the Riverina premises.
	
	
	In a Statement of Agreed Facts dated 28 November 2014 filed in the LEC, the following facts are stated:
	


“1.   Riverina (Australia) Pty Ltd (Riverina) operates a stock feed manufacturing mill (the Riverina Premises), sometimes referred to as ‘Riverina Stock Feeds’, near Casino. Riverina holds an environment protection licence in respect of the mill. The licence is for the scheduled activity of ‘agricultural processing’ and does not permit any pollution of waters. The mill is situated to the western side of Reynolds Road. On the eastern side of Reynolds Road, opposite the mill, are paddocks used for cattle grazing. This land is owned and used by the Northern Co-operative Meat Company (the NCMC Land) who is the holder of Environment Protection Licence 1461 allowing NCMC to irrigate effluent onto the NCMC Land.

2.   Reynolds Road runs in a roughly north/south direction. The Riverina Premises is located to the west of that road. A ‘dish drain’ runs beside the western side of Reynolds Road. At the relevant time, the dish drain was a vegetated, fairly shallow drainage line about 1 metre wide. At a point north of the Premises, there is a culvert under Reynolds Road. The dish drain leads into the culvert. On the eastern side of Reynolds Road, the culvert leads into a drainage line which runs through the NCMC Land.

3.   Liquid raw material used in the manufacture of the stock feed, being poultry oil, molasses, vegetable oil and a commercial product called ‘Alimet’, is stored in four tanks. Poultry oil is a fat obtained from chicken rendering and processing. Molasses is obtained from the juice of sugar cane. Alimet is a feed supplement. The tanks sit within a concrete bund, referred to as the liquid raw material bund. If liquid raw material leaks or spills from the tanks or is spilt during loading or unloading of the tanks, it is contained within that bund.

4.   The liquid and solid raw materials are blended and turned into small pellets, which are the finished stock feed product. The pellets are stored in a silo before being loaded into trucks and transported from the site.

5.   A boiler is used for heating and to power some of the operations at the mill. Potable water is fed into the boiler and water softener and scale inhibitor is added to it.

6.   The Riverina mill has no connection to the sewerage system. Liquid waste therefore must be collected and disposed of by liquid waste transporters. Riverina has a stormwater drainage system, which collects water and runoff only from the mill premises. The system drains to a number of outlets, including three along the eastern boundary of the Riverina Premises.”


	
	The primary judge observed at [45] that:
	


“… unless particular (1)(c)(i) of the summons is understood as alleging as the ‘manner of contravention’ of s 120 of the POEOA the placing of a pollutant into the drain leading from the bund, the charge is defective because, read on its own, it is capable of referring to a class of unparticularised and entirely different disparate acts that may have occurred at different places on Riverina's premises, involving unrelated equipment and practices. That is to say, the implicit reference to s 257 in particular 1(c)(i) (confirmed in the letter dated 2 June 2014) impermissibly leaves at large what act of pollution of waters is alleged. Thus, for example, it is unknown whether the charge relates to the actions of Riverina at the bund, at the main concrete hardstand area where pellets are sometimes spilled and cleaned up, or on the western side of Riverina's premises (the bund and the drains leading from it are located on the eastern side of its premises).”


	
	As discussed above, Pepper J referred to the affidavit evidence of Environmental Protection Officers, in particular, of Mr Cramb, affirmed 14 April 2014, at [40]-[41], [56], [66] and [72]-[81] and of Mr Greenbank sworn 25 June 2014. Mr Greenbank referred to overland flow and flow through drainage pipe 2 to the east, in addition to flow to the west at [35] and [36]. Her Honour then observed at [46]:
	


“… Hence, as presently framed, the summons contemplates an act of pollution arising at the bund, and some other unspecified act of pollution occurring from one or other parts of the Riverina premises. It is consequently duplicitous giving rise, as it does, to two distinct unlawful acts, and therefore, two separate offences charged within the one count.”


	
	In Mr Cramb’s affidavit, it was noted that Riverina’s premises was located to the west of Reynolds Road which ran in a roughly north/south direction. A “dish drain” runs along the western side of Reynolds Road, roughly parallel to it. Specific areas noted included:
	



	
	A concreted hard stand “outloading area” beneath the “50’s silos”. Five stormwater pits were seen in this area. Mr Cramb referred to information provided on inspection by employees of Riverina that washing down of the concreted hardstand “outloading area” had ceased since council notification on 23 April 2013: Affidavit of Geff Cramb at [56], [66].
	
	
	Drains and stormwater discharge pipes inside the premises western security fence including four stormwater discharge pipes and associated drainage which led from the Riverina concreted areas and discharged beneath the western security fence: Affidavit of Geff Cramb at [72]. The most northern of them, stormwater drain (1), was the largest and appeared to Mr Cramb to be contaminated: Affidavit of Geff Cramb at [73].
	



	
	In the submissions for the respondent at [29] questions were raised in relation to paragraph 1(c)(i), in particular, as to whether the act of pollution alleged involved one or other of the following:
	



	
	Spillage down the slope elevated from and fronting the “Waters’ adjoining Reynolds Road.
	
	
	Placement of pollutant in another stormwater drain unconnected to the LRMB and if so, at what point, there being many such drains.
	
	
	Washdown of spilled feed pellets and other ingredients into “Waters” from the extensive hardstand area underneath the loading hoppers at the Premises.
	
	
	Bags of feed stock ingredients or feedstock being directly introduced or accidently deposited in or near the “Waters” or some other aspect.
	


CONSIDERATION

QUESTION 1: Whether the Court erred in finding that the summons filed on 17 April 2014 was bad for duplicity because more than one offence had been charged in the one count of contravention of s 120(1) of the PoEO Act.

Principles


	
	The general principle in respect of what is known as the rule against duplicity is that an indictment (or Summons) should not, in one count, charge the defendant with having committed two or more separate offences: Archibold: Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice (2013) London, Sweet-Maxwell at [1-216].
	
	
	The objection in cases involving duplicity is that the accused does not know with any certainty the charge he/she has to meet: S v The Queen (1989) 168 CLR 266, 281 per Toohey J.
	
	
	In Johnson v Miller at 489-490, Dixon J observed:
	


“…the question is whether the prosecutor should not be required to identify one of a number of sets of facts, each amounting to the commission of the same offence as that on which the charge is based. In my opinion he clearly should be required to identify the transaction on which he relies and he should be so required as soon as it appears that his complaint, in spite of its apparent particularity, is equally capable of referring to a number of occurrences each of which constitutes the offence the legal nature of which is described in the complaint. For a defendant is entitled to be apprised not only of the legal nature of the offence with which he is charged but also of the particular act, matter or thing alleged as the foundation of the charge. The court hearing a complaint or information for an offence must have before it a means of identifying with the matter or transaction alleged in the document the matter or transaction appearing in evidence.”


	
	As soon as it appears that a count in an indictment (and equally in a summons charging an offence) is equally capable of referring to a number of occasions, each of which constitutes the offence the legal nature of which is described in the count, the prosecution should identify the occasion which is said to give rise to the offence charged: S v The Queen, supra, at p 282 per Toohey J. See also Rixon v Thompson [2009] VSCA 84; (2009) 22 VR 323, Maxwell P, Weinberg and Kyrou AJA at [46].
	
	
	The application of the doctrine of duplicity is relatively straightforward when the elements of the offence are discrete (as in Johnson v Miller – which concerned persons coming out of licensed premises on a Sunday morning). In other cases a number of acts that form part of a course of conduct or transaction, or a criminal enterprise may be charged in a single count, as, for example, an offence of defrauding the Commonwealth: R v Moussad [1999] NSWCCA 337; (1999) 152 FLR 373. See also discussion in Environmental Protection Authority v Truegain Pty Ltd (2013) 85 NSWLR 125 at [48] per Leeming JA.
	
	
	The general rule is that unless the allegation constitutes a continuing offence or offences which are closely related amounting to the one activity, they should be separately charged; Environment Protection Authority v Truegain Pty Ltd, supra, at [50] per Leeming JA; Walsh v Tattersall, supra, per Kirby J at 107.
	
	
	In the application of the rule a proper construction of the statutory provisions that create the relevant offence is essential for the purpose of identifying the elements of the offence and in determining the particular conduct (both acts or omissions) sufficient to constitute an offence. These are matters of substance, not form: Environment Protection Authority v Truegain, supra, per Leeming JA at [65].
	
	
	Acts or omissions, disparate in nature and content, involving different items of plant or different work systems, operations and procedures or different locations on particular premises in cases involving prosecutions for breach of statutory obligations to provide and maintain a safe working environment have been held to be duplicitous: Chugg v Pacific Dunlop Ltd [1988] VR 411; Boral Gas (NSW) Pty Ltd v Magill (1995) 37 NSWLR 150 at 179. The conduct particularised in a summons in such cases provides the basis for determining the discrete or separate offence charged.
	
	
	In Truegain, the respondent was charged with an offence against s 64(1) of the Protection of the Environment Operations Act 1997. Truegain was the holder of an Environment Protection Licence which authorised the carrying out of “Scheduled activities” at specified premises. The relevant scheduled activity was “waste processing non-thermal treatment”.
	
	
	The summons in that case alleged Truegain contravened a condition of the licence, being an alleged failure to carry out its licensed activities in a competent manner. The relevant particulars alleged a breach of the condition in respect of “treatment and/or storage”. Leeming JA, with whom RA Hulme and Button JJ agreed, observed:
	


[72]   Matters of fact and degree are apt to arise where duplicity is alleged. However, storage is different from treatment, and the storage alleged to have been performed incompetently took place on different days, and with different equipment, from the treatment which is alleged to have been performed incompetently. In the present case, the charge extends to failure to store and failure to treat. Let it be assumed, favourably to the EPA, that all of the machinery and facilities on Truegain’s premises formed a single ‘entity’. Nevertheless, it is plain on the face of the particulars that the conduct and omissions giving rise to the alleged incompetent storage is different (in time, in location, and in content) from the conduct and omissions giving rise to the alleged incompetent treatment.” (emphasis added)


	
	Section 120 of the PoEO Act by its use of the verb “pollute” (which is defined in s 120(2) as including “cause or permit any waters to be polluted”) identifies the essence or the elements of an offence charged under that section. The expressions “water pollution” and “pollution of waters” are defined in the Dictionary to the PoEO Act in terms that identify the type of conduct or action that constitutes an offence.
	
	
	A person prosecuted under s 120 is entitled to be provided with particulars of the alleged conduct – when, how and where – that is the time, manner and location of an alleged contravention: Johnson v Miller, supra, at 489; Kirk v Industrial Court of New South Wales (2010) 239 CLR 531 at [25]-[29]. As discussed below, the provisions of s 257 do not alter that position with respect to an occupier of premises. It is the act of pollution that gives rise to liability under s 120.
	
	
	The pleading of the charge in the Summons in paragraphs 1(c)(ii) and (iii) together with the Letter of Particulars in relation thereto, provides the respondent with notice of the factual substratum as to the manner of the alleged contravention. They in particular state the particular acts of pollution charged. Subparagraph 1(c)(i) on the other hand, as discussed below, pleads a general allegation of the respondent as “occupier” of the specified premises “at and from which pollution occurred”, words which reflect the statutory language appearing in s 257.
	
	
	Paragraph 1(c)(i) of the Summons does not specify how or where on the respondent’s premises the offence or offences charged occurred. The paragraph as pleaded is without limitation as to acts or conduct alleged to have caused the pollution of waters. Paragraph 1(c)(i) is not restricted or confined to or by the particulars relied upon in relation to 1(c)(ii) and/or (iii). It is relied upon as an independent and alternative basis or foundation upon which the appellant prosecutor seeks to establish liability in the respondent.
	
	
	The failure by the appellant to identify the act or manner of pollution referred to in paragraph 1(c)(i) means that the Summons is capable of encompassing any or all possible acts of pollution at or from the premises. As such it attracts the principles concerned with uncertainty in criminal pleading and duplicity.
	
	
	The EPA’s submission that the Summons charges only one offence, and that the particulars set out a number of alternatives to go “to the matter of proof, not to the occurrence of the offence” (Appellant’s Written Submissions at [27]) is a submission in the nature of an assertion. As observed above, the issue of duplicity involves questions of substance, not form. In relation to paragraph 1(c)(i), the letter of particulars dated 2 June 2014 states that the EPA relies upon s 257 of the PoEO Act “to establish that the pollution was caused by the Defendant, by virtue of the Defendant being the occupier of the Premises”.
	
	
	As the appellant relied upon Particular 1(c)(i) as an independent basis of liability, alternative to paragraphs 1(c)(ii) and (iii), the Summons is not one that relies upon a number of facts as constituting components of one activity. Paragraph 1(c)(i) in that sense stands or falls as a single count alleging a single contravention.
	
	
	The EPA’s submission that the offence is a “result offence” is not a submission that addresses the failure to identify the factual substratum upon which it seeks to have criminal liability imposed upon the respondent by paragraph 1(c)(i). The submission in [39] of the Appellant’s Written Submissions that “... the results that are proven all arise as a consequence of the same criminal activity, namely water pollution …” with respect begs the question as to what is the “activity” relied upon by the EPA in terms of a particular act, omission, operation, place, equipment or processes (ie, the manner of contravention).
	
	
	Insofar as paragraph 1(c)(i) applies to two or more acts of pollution – not involving the LRMB – any liability sought to be established at the hearing of the Summons would be based on a different factual foundation. The single count pleaded in the Summons accordingly alleges two or more offences under s 120. As such the Summons contravenes the rule against duplicity. The question as to whether the provisions of s 257 of the PoEO Act relied upon by the appellant/prosecutor in relation to paragraph 1(c)(i) operate to obviate the need for the EPA to comply with the principle enunciated by Dixon J in Johnson v Miller, supra, is a matter discussed below in relation to Question 2.
	


Question 2: Whether, upon its proper construction, s 257 of PoEO Act obviates the need for the prosecutor to provide the defendant (respondent in these proceedings) with the essential details of the particular acts, matter or thing alleged as the foundation of the manner of contravention of s 120(a) of the PoEO Act contained in the summons.


	
	Question 2 requires consideration of:
	



	
	The proper construction of s 257;
	
	
	The function and purpose of s 257; and
	
	
	The scope of its operation in a prosecution for an offence under s 120.
	



	
	In the discussion above concerning Question 1 I have expressed the conclusion that s 257 does not obviate the need for the prosecutor to provide the defendant with the essential details of the particular act, matter of thing alleged as the foundation of the manner of contravention of s 120(1) contained in paragraph 1(c)(i) of the Summons. The discussion that follows seeks to develop the reasons for the conclusion I have expressed.
	
	
	The commencement point is the fundamental requirement for a summons charging an offence to disclose essential elements of the offence. In this respect the principle is well-established.
	
	
	In Taylor v Environment Protection Authority (2000) 50 NSWLR 48 at [16]; 113 LGERA 116 at 125-6, Sperling J said:
	


“The word ‘information’ is most commonly used to mean the document by which criminal proceedings are instituted before a magistrate. The function of such an information is to provide sufficient information for the issue of a summons directing the defendant to appear to answer the charge.”


	
	In McConnell Dowell Constructors (Aust) Pty Ltd v Environment Protection Authority (2000) 50 NSWLR 127 at 134 (which approved the above dicta in Taylor) Spigelman CJ having considered the terms of the summons charging pollution of waters contrary to s 16(1) of the Clean Waters Act 1970, said at [47]-[48]:
	


“In my opinion, some reference to the conduct … said to constitute the act of polluting was required in the summons and in the s 41 order. Section 16 has been called a ‘result offence’, in the sense that the consequence, that is, the pollution, is an essential ingredient of the offence … However as Hunt CJ at CL said in EPA v Bathurst CC (1995) 89 LGERA 79 at 82 … ‘the prosecution is required to prove both the conduct of the defendant in placing the material in the waters and the pollution of the waters as a consequence of the defendant having done so’.”


	
	As stated in the discussion on Question 1, I am of the opinion that in the present case the EPA was required to prove:
	



	
	The relevant act (or omissions) causing the alleged water pollution; and
	
	
	That the pollution of the waters was a consequence of that act (or omission).
	



	
	In the Letter of Particulars of 2 June 2014, the EPA alleged that the defendant placed the pollutant into the drain leading from the LRMB and the drain or drains into which that drain flowed. No factual ingredient of the offence as particularised in paragraph 1(c)(i) was specified or stated.
	
	
	Accordingly, no facts as to or constituting the act of pollution were identified. In that circumstance the respondent was not informed as to whether the act of pollution related to a particular operation conducted by the respondent on its premises or to a particular part of the premises. No particulars were provided in respect of “the time, place and manner of [the respondent’s] acts or omissions”, save for the statement “on or about 22 April 2013” in paragraph 1 of the Summons.
	
	
	In Pace Farm Egg Products Pty Ltd v Newcastle City Council [2006] NSWCCA 403; (2006) 151 LGERA 260, the defendant appealed its conviction by the LEC of an offence contrary to s 120(1) of the Protection of the Environment Operations Act 1997 that it polluted specified waters on a specified date. It was noted that the definition of “water pollution” covered both direct and indirect pollution. The case involved allegations of indirect pollution which involved placing matter in a position where it falls, descends or is washed or likely to fall etc into waters or into a drain or channel designed to receive or pass rainwater, if the matter would, if placed in water, pollute or be likely to pollute the waters.
	
	
	There were two circumstances that arose that could have caused pollution. One was a leak in a tank adjacent to the defendant’s factory building. Another or additional circumstance was pollution resulting from the escape of diluted egg waste (referred to as the “Fitzpatrick incident”).
	
	
	On appeal, Handley JA (with whom Kirby J agreed, RS Hulme J dissenting) held that the summons was not duplicitous on its face – the only “defect was the failure to identify the act of the appellant which placed the pollutant in a position where it was likely to and did fall etc.”
	
	
	Whilst no specific reliance was placed upon the provisions of s 257, Handley JA referred to the fact that those provisions could have applied, in particular, in relation to the subcontractor in respect of the “Fitzpatrick incident”. Section 257, of course, was also available in the prosecution of the appellant in respect of the pollution resulting from its actions in placing egg waste in the tank. Handley JA, however, proceeded upon the basis that particulars as required by Johnson v Miller applied:
	


“[32]   In the present case the summons and order were not duplicitous on their face and the only defect was the failure to identify the act of the appellant which placed the pollutant in a position where it was likely to and did fall etc.

[33]   Section 16(2) of the Procedure Act or its equivalent preserves a summons under s 246(1) of that Act from the consequences that would otherwise flow from a failure to specify essential particulars of the offence: Stanton v Abernathy (above) at 667; Taylor v EPA (above) at 57; McConnell (No 2) (above) at 41–2.

[34]   Since the summons did not particularise ‘the particular act, matter or thing alleged as the foundation of the charge’: Johnson v Miller (1937) 59 CLR at 489, the appellant was entitled to further and better particulars: para [31]. However it neither challenged the validity of the summons nor sought such particulars.

[35]   There was a potential latent duplicity in the charge. Although evidence for the Council focussed on the appellant’s acts in placing egg waste in the tank it also led evidence without objection about the Fitzpatrick incident: paras [6] and [8]. An occupier of premises at or from which any pollution occurs is responsible for that pollution including any caused by a subcontractor: Act s 257.

[36]   However as the Judge said: para [8] ‘it was not part of the Prosecutor’s case that there was an escape of egg waste into SW6 due to Mr Fitzpatrick’s actions’.

[37]   If the appellant had objected to the form of the summons the Council would have been required to give particulars of the act or acts of the appellant relied on to establish its criminal responsibility. Its particulars would have indicated that it did not rely on the Fitzpatrick incident, and that there was no duplicity.”


	
	Whilst the judgment of Handley JA in Pace Farms was not one that considered whether the obligation on a prosecutor to identify the act of the appellant, an occupier of premises, as an element of the offence charged under s 120 was limited or affected by s 257 it was nonetheless a judgment that proceeded upon the basis that the obligation existed and that there had been a “failure to identify the act of the appellant which placed the pollutant in a position where it was likely to and did fall etc”: Pace Farms at [32].”
	
	
	Section 257, as the appellant’s submissions state, is not an offence‑creating provision. It does not make any express reference to s 120. It is in the nature of a deeming provision to proceedings in which a person is charged with a pollution offence under the Act. It is not limited to water pollution. Section 257 is a provision that facilitates proof of one matter, namely that the particular defendant (occupier) caused the alleged pollution.
	
	
	Section 120 by its terms facilitates proof of an offence, inter alia, of a contravention of s 120 by attributing pollution to the occupier of premises at and from which the pollution occurs.
	
	
	Section 257 however only operates upon proof of a particularised act of pollution which is an element of an offence charged under s 120. The terms of s 257 do not, in my opinion, exempt a prosecutor from an obligation to identify the factual substratum, namely, the specific act of pollution.
	
	
	Section 257 does not eliminate the need for admissible evidence to prove the element of the offence created by s 120, the act of pollution. Section 257 operates only after evidence adduced in a prosecution establishes the relevant act of pollution (or other conduct causing the pollution). Section 257 removes a requirement to prove that the occupier was the person who committed the act of pollution. Section 257 does not otherwise alter the legal elements of a s 120 offence.
	
	
	Whether s 257 applies in a given case or not does not, in my opinion, mean that a defendant must be left in a position of embarrassment or disadvantage in not being informed before trial as to the particular act alleged as the foundation of the charge. The lack of particularity necessarily in the present case gives rise to the potential for a miscarriage of justice.
	
	
	As Dixon J in Johnson v Miller observed:
	


“… a defendant is entitled to be apprised not only of the legal nature of the offence with which he is charged but also of the particular act, matter or thing alleged as the foundation of the charge …” (at 489)


	
	Section 257 does not, either by its terms or by necessary intendment, in my opinion, obviate the need for the prosecutor to provide the respondent with particulars of the facts alleged as the foundation of the charge made in particular 1(c)(i). That said, the position remains, namely, that the provisions of s 257 cannot, in my opinion, save or permit a duplicitous information or summons. The provisions of s 257 do not displace the basic rule of common law applicable to criminal pleading, namely, that no count in an indictment (or summons) should charge a defendant as having committed two or more separate offences – as in my opinion has occurred in this case by particulars 1(c)(i), (ii) and (iii).
	


Conclusion


	
	In relation to the questions that have been submitted for determination by this Court pursuant to s 5AE of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, I have determined, for reasons discussed, that the questions should be answered as follows:
	


Question 1:    Whether the Court erred in finding that the summons filed on 17 April 2014 was bad for duplicity because more than one offence had been charged in the one count of contravention of s 120(1) of the PoEO Act.

Answer:    “No”.

Question 2:   Whether, upon its proper construction, s 257 of the PoEO Act obviates the need for the Prosecutor to provide the defendant with the essential details of the particular act, matter or thing alleged as the foundation of the manner of contravention of s 120(1) of the PoEO Act contained in paragraph 1(c)(i) of the Summons.

Answer:   “No”.


	
	In relation to any ancillary or consequential matters, including costs, the parties are directed to file and serve written submissions within a period of 28 days from the date of this judgment in accordance with an agreed timetable.
	
	
	GARLING J: I agree with Hall J.

		25 June 2015",2015-06-24 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2703186,Dang v R; Tran v R [2015] NSWCCA 163,"Judgment


	
	R A HULME J: Dao Nguyen Dang and Binh Huy Tran were found guilty by a jury after a 14-day trial in 2013 of attempting to possess heroin, it being a border controlled drug in a marketable quantity that had been unlawfully imported.
	
	
	The offence is contrary to the provisions of ss 307.6(1) and 11.1(1) of the Criminal Code (Cth) and is punishable by imprisonment for 25 years and/or a fine of 5000 penalty units.
	
	
	They were sentenced on 14 October 2013 by his Honour Judge Arnott SC to imprisonment for 7 years 10 months with a non-parole period of 5 years 2 months (Dang) and 10 years with a non-parole period of 6 years 6 months (Tran). Both sentences were specified to have commenced on 24 June 2013.
	
	
	Mr Dang's appeal against conviction is based upon two grounds:
	


Ground 1: That in all the circumstances the verdict of the jury was `unreasonable and therefore there was occasioned to the appellant a miscarriage of justice within the meaning of s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW);

Ground 2: The trial judge erred in law by ruling as relevant and admissible in the prosecution case against the appellant Dang evidence of Tran’s visit to Hong Kong and evidence of cash money discovered by police at the home of Tran and further erred by declining to sever the appellant Dang from the indictment and grant him a separate trial.


	
	Mr Tran's appeal against conviction is based upon a sole ground:
	


The verdict of the jury with respect to Count 1 is unreasonable and cannot be supported by the evidence.


	
	Leave is required in relation to the grounds asserting that the verdicts are unreasonable. I am of the view that leave should be granted and so I will refer to Mr Dang and Mr Tran collectively as the appellants.
	
	
	Both appellants applied for leave to appeal against the sentences imposed. In respect of those applications I agree with the orders proposed by Bellew J for the reasons his Honour has provided.
	


Overview of the Crown case


	
	The Crown alleged that the appellants acted in concert in an attempt to possess a consignment of 1395 grams of powder containing 822.3 grams of heroin. The heroin had been unlawfully imported into Australia from Hong Kong concealed inside 10 table tennis bats. The consignment left Hong Kong on 12 May and arrived in Australia on 14 May 2012.
	
	
	Australian Customs officials detected a discrepancy in the package and passed it on to the Australian Federal Police (""AFP""). AFP officers substituted flour for the heroin, reconstructed the package and inserted a listening device.
	
	
	A co-offender, Shing Yuet Yeung, took delivery of the package at 138 The Boulevarde, Strathfield at about 1.50pm on 16 May 2012 from an AFP officer purporting to be a Federal Express (“FedEx”) courier. AFP officers were in the vicinity carrying out surveillance.
	
	
	The listening device recorded Yeung deconstructing the package and engaging in telephone conversations with a number of people including Tran. Yeung expressed concern that the weight and texture of the substance that had been secreted within the table tennis bats was not as it should be. (The police evidence was to the effect that the flour was only about half the weight of the substance containing the heroin.) About an hour after taking deliver, Yeung was joined by a co-offender, Ho Fung Lam. Lam was recorded voicing similar concern about the substance.
	
	
	The appellants were first seen in the vicinity of 138 The Boulevarde by the AFP officers not long after Lam had arrived. The officers moved in to make arrests shortly after 3.00pm. Yeung was arrested inside the house and Lam was arrested as he was leaving. The appellants were arrested on the footpath diagonally across the road. It was the Crown case that the appellants were there for the purpose of taking possession of the drugs.
	
	
	Tran was seen to throw an item away immediately before he was arrested. It was later identified as a Vodafone SIM card from a phone in his possession which, on the Crown case, had been used in telephone conversations with Yeung. Tran was also in possession of three other mobile phones. Dang was found to be in possession of two phones.
	
	
	Police also found drug paraphernalia and cash in the possession of each of Dang and Tran, including almost $150,000 in cash at Tran's home.
	
	
	Evidence based upon telephone records indicated that Dang and Tran were in frequent contact, calling each other multiple times on a daily basis in the weeks leading up to 16 May 2012. Likewise Yeung and Lam were in frequent contact with each other. The Crown contended that there had been contact between Tran and Yeung as well.
	
	
	Based upon telephone conversations involving Yeung, his end being recorded by the listening device, it was the Crown case that there was a meeting arranged for 3.00pm on 16 May 2012 for the appellants to collect the drugs. Tran was referred to by Yeung as ""Jimmy"".
	


The Crown's circumstantial case


	
	The Crown case was based upon circumstantial evidence that fell into a number of categories.
	


A Hong Kong connection


	
	The consignment containing the heroin was sent from Hong Kong on 12 May 2012 and arrived two days later.
	
	
	Immigration records showed that Lam arrived in Perth from Hong Kong on 10 March 2012 and Yeung arrived in Sydney from Hong Kong on 21 April 2012. Tran was a resident of Sydney but was in Hong Kong in the period 17 to 23 April 2012.
	


Contact between Dang and Tran


	
	In the period 4 to 15 May 2012, there was an average of 15 contacts per day between phones associated with Dang and Tran. Their phones were in contact 21 times on 16 May prior to the delivery of the consignment to 138 The Boulevarde. They described themselves as being friends but the Crown argued that this frequency of contact indicated they were more than that.
	


Contact between Yeung and Lam


	
	On 16 May 2012 there were 8 telephone contacts between Yeung and Lam prior to the delivery of the consignment and 4 between the delivery and the arrival of Lam and when he entered the home at 138 The Boulevarde at about 3.05pm.
	


Contact between Tran and Yeung prior to 16 May 2012


	
	Upon his arrest, Tran was found in possession of a phone with a number ending in 858 (""the 858 phone""). He contended that he was given this phone to hold only a short time before his arrest. The Crown case was that he had the 858 phone in his possession at all material times. If the Crown was correct in this assertion, the following is relevant to the case against Tran.
	
	
	There were about 10 contacts made between phones associated with Tran and Yeung on 11 May and 2 on the evening of 14 May 2012. One of the contacts made on 11 May was a text message sent to Tran (to the 858 phone): ""22 angel rd Strathfld"". (Exh A9 - AB 189) Yeung's home (a boarding house) was on the corner of The Boulevarde and Angel Road on the eastern side of The Boulevarde. 22 Angel Road was two doors down from the corner.
	
	
	The first call Yeung made after the delivery of the consignment on 16 May was to Tran (to the 858 phone). Then, there were seven contacts in both directions in a period of 50 seconds.
	


Delivery of the consignment


	
	Federal agent Dib (“FA Dib”), dressed as a FedEx courier, attempted to deliver the consignment at about 11.50am on 16 May 2012. No-one was home and he left a card under the door with contact details to organise a future time and date for delivery.
	
	
	At about 1.03pm he received a call from Yeung who said he was home and asked for the delivery to be made. FA Dib said he would be there in about an hour.
	
	
	The Crown pointed to this evidence as indicating that Yeung, and those with whom he was in contact, would have had no knowledge prior to about 1.00pm as to when the delivery was likely to be made.
	
	
	FA Dib made the delivery to Yeung at about 1.50pm.
	


Activity following delivery of the consignment


	
	It is important to bear in mind in what follows that only Yeung's side of any conversation was recorded by the listening device secreted within the consignment. He spoke in Cantonese which had been translated. The transcripts of the conversation, read in conjunction with the telephone records showing whose phone was in contact with whom provide a guide as to whom he was speaking with.
	
	
	Another matter to note is that it became common ground in this Court that a record of transmissions made by the AFP officers (Exhibit T4), and which formed the basis upon which the officers prepared their statements, recorded times of various events that were almost two minutes behind the actual time. Thus, in synchronising events appearing in this log with events recorded by the listening device and the telephone records, an adjustment was required to be made. I have done this in what follows.
	
	
	Police monitoring the listening device noted that the connection to it dropped out in between 1.52pm and 2.06pm.
	
	
	As indicated above, there was a series of contacts between Yeung and the phone said by the Crown to be in Tran's possession (the 858 phone); 7 within 50 seconds from 2.02.47. Given the connection to the listening device was inoperative at this time there was no recording of Yeung's side of any conversation.
	
	
	Tran then immediately rang Dang (at 2.03.53pm).
	
	
	Yeung spoke by phone to an unknown person in a call commencing at 2.06pm. He told the person that ""it"" had not been opened by anyone; ""it"" was definitely okay; the time ""here"" was 2 o'clock and that something had been set down for 3 o'clock. He would ring this person back after he had weighed ""them"".
	
	
	AFP officers monitoring the listening device noted that there were then sounds like someone was accessing the consignment.
	
	
	At 2.10pm, Yeung spoke by phone about how he was unpacking the consignment.
	
	
	A minute or two after this he was in contact with Lam, according to the telephone records. The coinciding listening device transcript at this time includes Yeung saying, “Already given, it’s set at three o’clock”. He also told Lam to “just come over here first”.
	
	
	Yeung had a number of phone conversations thereafter but it will only be necessary to refer to some of them.
	
	
	Tran rang Dang again at 2.23pm.
	
	
	At 2.28pm, Yeung spoke to ""Ah Gor"" in what was the first of a number of conversations in which he spoke of his concern that the consignment was of an appearance, weight and texture that was not what was expected. In further conversation with “Ah Gor” he referred to this consignment as being ""different from the previous ones"". (The translator explained that ""Ah Gor"" was a colloquialism which could have the equivalent in English of ""Mate"", ""Hey mate"", ""Brother"" or ""Hey bro"").
	
	
	At 2.38pm, Yeung said to an unidentified person that ""I am waiting for phone call from other people now"". He continued speaking of his concern about the consignment.
	
	
	At 2.45pm in conversation with an unknown person he made reference to his ""boss"" having told him that there should be more than ""1400"" but there was only about half that (which was consistent with the police evidence about the weight of the flour).
	
	
	Lam arrived in a taxi at 2.45pm and lingered in the vicinity outside 138 The Boulevarde for the next 20 minutes or so. He was in phone contact with Yeung on four occasions in this period.
	
	
	At 2.47pm, Yeung spoke with a person who was obviously not in the vicinity. He spoke of the appearance and weight of the consignment and offered to ""send you the photo so that you can have a look, to see if it is the original appearance"".
	
	
	At 2.48pm, Yeung spoke with a person who must have been Lam. He invited him to ""come over to here and have a look first"". They would ""talk after you have come here"". He also made reference to the ""Si Fu"", that is the ""Si Fu of the other side"". The translator explained that ""Si Fu"" was Cantonese for ""master"", ""maestro"" or ""expert"". It seems a reasonable inference, as counsel for the appellants contended, that this was a reference to a person who was higher up in the hierarchy who was overseas. In his closing address to the jury the Crown Prosecutor contended that it was a reference to ""the other side who is going to collect it"". That seems less likely.
	
	
	At 2.51pm, Yeung spoke with a person who appears to have been ""Si Fu"" and relayed a description of what he had seen after unpacking the consignment. He compared it with what they ""normally"" looked like.
	
	
	Yeung interrupted that conversation at 2.53pm to take a call on another phone. It was a call from the 858 phone found in Tran's possession upon his arrest. Yeung's side of the conversation was:
	


""Hi, brother Jimmy, what is the matter, brother Jimmy? [Pause] Hm, please wait, hm, I'll call you back later as I am having something to do now. I am sorry. [Pause] You just wait, should not be long. [Pause]""


	
	Yeung then returned to his conversation with the ""Si Fu"" about the problems with the consignment. He made a suggestion of adding something to it.
	
	
	At around 2.54pm, Tran was seen by FA Law walking west on Wonga Street and he turned right into The Boulevarde in the direction of No 138. (Wonga Street is the next street parallel to Angel Road.) A minute and a half, or two minutes, later a red, maroon or orange Nissan Navara was seen travelling down Wonga Street towards The Boulevarde, but it turned left. It was recorded in the surveillance log that FA Fitzpatrick passed on that ""they got out of like a dark maroon-ey Nissan Navara I think it was"". FA Law called in the registration number and somebody in the AFP Major Incident Room, where transmissions were being monitored, relayed that the registered owner ""had some two thousand and one supply drugs offences"".
	
	
	While this was going on, Lam was seen walking around the area of 138 The Boulevarde, sometimes with a phone to his ear. He entered the yard once but then walked away. Tran was seen to walk north along The Boulevarde and stopped near Lam outside No 138. There was no apparent interchange between them and a short time later Tran walked away, south, along The Boulevarde only to be seen a short time later walking back in a northerly direction crossing Angel Road. This would appear to have been just after the call to Yeung at 2.53pm.
	
	
	At 2.56pm, Yeung was continuing the conversation with the person he commenced speaking to at 2.53pm. The transcript records him saying:
	


""Oh, so, what should be done now … [Pause] Have already been checked. [Pause] Not yet, that is what I am saying, there, now we are talking about, hey, buddy, it's now short by almost half! [Pause] Just keep delaying with Jimmy first [Pause]

Is it … [Ind] has a head of long hair … Jimmy Gor [Cantonese means Elder Brother Jimmy]? [Pause] that is Jim Gor? [Pause] That's right, I previously, previously, I, I already told you, I told 'Andrew Lo' [Phonetic sound of words heard] on the twenty second (22nd) to wait for me at the end of the street.""


	
	At about 2.57pm, Tran was seen walking south along the opposite (western) side of The Boulevarde. He looked up a side street (Llandilo Avenue, directly opposite Angel Road) and kept walking.
	
	
	At about the same time, Yeung spoke to ""Ah Gor"". He said, in part:
	


""Has already rung me, but there, they said to me, hm, [Pause] him, I am now calculating, I am now working out the figures [Pause] Hm, … [Ind] He says, hm, he wants to check if the quantity of table-tennis bats is correct, and whether, when put together, whether the weight is enough, when he comes over to here. [Pause] [There was then further mention of the problems with the consignment and Yeung's suggestion of adding something to it] But although I have got enough now yet, as previously, before I came, I already asked Jimmy and now, Jimmy has arrived, the arrangement, and is already in the street next to me [Pause] That is, with that thing … [Ind] [Pause] He said to me that after the time was set, … [Ind] [Pause]”. (Italics indicate my note.)


	
	Lam entered No 138 at 3.00pm or thereabouts. The listening device recorded a conversation between Lam and Yeung about the consignment. Yeung told Lam of the weight of the substance, including references that were consistent with there being 700 grams instead of 1350 grams. He said he had just spoken to ""the boss ... the opposite side, the boss of the other side and quoted four gram, and a half … [Ind] and I said just to refer to the paper work and it's only four gram"". He then told Lam at 3.00.44pm, ""I am now waiting for phone call"".
	
	
	A very short time later, Yeung answered a call from a person he referred to as ""Ah Gor"". He told him what the outcome was after something he referred to as ""recycling""; perhaps a reference to adding something to the substance to make up the required weight. He continued:
	


""… but I still need him to call me later [Pause] You told me to do the recycle, so I do the recycling and after the sum is calculated as well as after I receive hers/his phone call [Pause] I'll then give him a call later, is that alright?""


	
	At around the same time, Tran was seen with Dang walking north on the western side of The Boulevarde. They looked up Llandilo Avenue and then proceeded out of sight.
	
	
	In the ensuing minutes there was a conversation between Yeung and Lam about the problem with the substance. This included reference to it not having the expected smell and the like. Yeung suggested, ""Well let what-you-call try then but might (Ind) not even be able to guess (Ind)"".
	
	
	At 3.06pm, Yeung answered a call from ""Ah Gor"". He further confirmed that the substance was not as it should be; not as it had been previously. He also referred to having spoken to ""the Si Fu on the other side"". This would indicate that “Ah Gor” was likely in this country somewhere, as opposed to ""Si Fu"" who was overseas.
	
	
	About a minute into this conversation Yeung interrupted to say that ""Jimmy Gor is now calling, what should I do, really, you tell me?"" The reply was obviously not recorded but Yeung acknowledged whatever it was and proceeded to answer the call from ""Jimmy Gor"".
	
	
	This call was made from the 858 phone found in Tran's possession a short time later when he was arrested. The phone records and listening device time stamp showed the call commenced at 3.07. The conversation, from Yeung's end, was as follows:
	


""Hey, brother Jimmy, hm, I am sorry, here, er I had already done … yeah, that's right, here, some small problems occur here. [Pause] You, would you mind waiting for another moment? [Pause] That is, hm, how about I will call you later for yum cha, is that okay? [Pause] After I have fixed everything first [Pause].""


	
	Yeung then returned to his conversation with “Ah Gor”:
	


""Well, so, now, what should we do? [Pause] yeah, oh, well, alright, I'll just call brother Jimmy then. [Pause] yeah [Pause] Yeah, alright, alright, alright.""


	
	That continuation of the conversation was, according to the listening device time stamp, from 3.07.51 to 3.08.10. The line to the listening device then dropped out. It was briefly reconnected and the sounds of ""yelling"" were heard. (It is safe to assume that police were making arrests at this point.) The recording ended.
	


Arrests


	
	The order for the police in the vicinity to move in and make arrests was communicated by radio by FA Stipnieks after he saw Lam walk out of 138 The Boulevarde. The precise time that arrests were made is controversial (and I shall return to it).
	
	
	The appellants were arrested on the opposite (western) side of The Boulevarde about 10 or 20 metres north of Llandilo Avenue. They were walking in a southerly direction approaching the police who emerged from Llandilo Avenue. FA Stipnieks saw Tran take a card out of a mobile phone he was carrying, bend it, and throw it away. FA Beckett simply saw him throw something away. The pair was arrested.
	


Conversation with Dang and items found


	
	FA Beckett searched Dang and what was found included:
	


$4120 in cash

A white Nokia mobile phone

A Blackberry mobile phone


	
	FA Beckett spoke to Dang at the scene. (Evidence of the conversation was only admitted in the case concerning Dang.) He denied he was involved in drugs and said he was there because ""Tran asked me to give him a lift to come here and that's all"". The money he had on him was ""to pay the builders for my sister's house because she gave it to me"".
	
	
	Notwithstanding Dang was released he agreed to remain and provide information. He told police that Tran phoned him and asked for a lift to Strathfield but did not specify any particular street. He did not know why Tran wanted to go to Strathfield. He picked Tran up from Tran's house in Fairfield East at about 2.00 or 2.15pm and they drove to Angel Road. Tran got out of the car and Dang went to find somewhere to park. Tran then asked Dang to get out of the car and walk with him and to bring his (Dang's) cigarettes with him. While they were walking together they talked about Tran's girlfriend and friend. Dang did not think it unusual that Tran wanted to walk around with him as Tran said he would go and meet a friend and just wait for a friend. Dang did not know the name of Tran's friend or why Tran was meeting the friend.
	
	
	Dang agreed to allow police to search his car (a blue Toyota RAV 4). The items found included:
	


$5000 in cash (all in $50 notes)

A black bag containing scales, a plastic spoon, a plastic bowl and three plastic bags containing a white powder


	
	(On subsequent analysis, the powder was found to be dimethylsulfone. FA Green gave evidence that, in his experience, this was a substance commonly used as a cutting agent for illicit drugs. The scales, spoon and bowl were swabbed and heroin, cocaine and caffeine were detected upon analysis.)
	
	
	Dang told police that the bag was not his; it was Tran's. When pressed for details he became unsure and he could not explain how it came to be in the boot of his car. But he remained certain that it was not his or his wife's. He said that Tran had a black bag when he got into the car earlier that day. He was not able to say whether he had it with him when he got out of the car. He denied ever having touched the bag the police found and did not know what was in it.
	
	
	On further questioning, Dang admitted that the bag was his. He was again placed under arrest for drug possession (he had earlier been released) and he replied, ""No drugs"". He admitted that he had lied when he earlier denied ownership of the bag. He told police the powder was ""to make the meat tender""; ""for marinating meat"". The scales were to weigh the powder accurately ""for the marinating of the meat"". He denied a proposition that it was a cutting agent in relation to drugs. He also denied that the money found on his person and in his car was the proceeds of drug sales. He maintained that it was ""to pay the workmen and to buy some stuff"".
	


Items found on arrest of Tran


	
	Tran was found to be in possession of four mobile phones, the SIM card for one of which was found nearby.
	


Search of Tran's home


	
	Tran's home at Fairfield Heights was searched by police the day after his arrest. Officers found various items including:
	


Two small bags containing powder and a piece of foil containing powder in a cupboard above the refrigerator

Electronic scales in the master bedroom

A total of $149,450 in cash in various locations in the master bedroom and under the kitchen sink


	
	The powder contained in the bags and foil were subsequently examined and found to weigh 0.1g, 1.1g and 0.1g respectively. The larger quantity was able to be analysed and the analysis revealed it contained heroin at 55.3% purity. The smaller quantities were determined to contain heroin as well. Tran's fingerprints were found on the piece of foil.
	


Betting evidence


	
	John Graham, the NSW investigations manager for Tabcorp Holdings Ltd was provided with copies of 19 TAB betting tickets by FA Santucci. (He had received them from Tran's solicitor as an explanation for the money found at Tran's home.) The barcodes on copies of two of the tickets were insufficiently clear but Mr Graham was able to establish that 17 were winning tickets where bets ranging from $200 to $4000 had been placed (a total of $19,070) which yielded winnings ranging from $1640 to $19,980 (a total of $103,254). The bets had all been in cash and they had been placed in suburbs near to Tran's home at Fairfield Heights. There was no record as to who had placed the bets or to whom the payout was made; Tran did not have an account.
	
	
	Seven of the payouts had been made after the finding of the cash at Tran's home; namely from 20 to 23 May 2012 with the payout total for these being $23,614.
	
	
	Lee Sienkiewicz, the licensee of the El Cortez Hotel gave evidence of gambling payouts to customers. He said that the first $2000 was paid in cash and anything in excess of that was paid by cheque. He provided evidence of there being payouts to Tran in the period 11 January to 27 April 2012 for a total of $76,937. There were no records of losses by patrons.
	


Telephone evidence


	
	Investigations were carried out in relation to the four mobile phones found in Tran's possession when he was arrested. There were no subscriber details for one of them but the other three were subscribed in names other than Tran's. The activation dates for those three were in late April-early May 2012. The 858 phone (which had only been used for contact with Yeung) had been activated on 24 April 2012, the day after Tran arrived home from his trip to Hong Kong.
	
	
	Of the two mobile phones found upon Dang, there were subscriber details available in respect of one of them and it was in a name other than his. That phone had been activated on 3 May 2012.
	
	
	Three mobile phones found within 138 The Boulevarde, Strathfield had all been activated in early May 2012 in names other than Yeung or Lam.
	
	
	A mobile phone found upon Lam had been activated on 2 May 2012, and not in his name.
	
	
	The Crown suggested that there was significance in the fact that all of the phones for which subscriber details were available had been activated after Yeung, Lam and Tran had travelled from Hong Kong to Australia. Further, a phone in the possession of Dang and a phone in the possession of Tran were both with Optus and were registered on the same day: 3 May 2012.
	
	
	FA Santucci confirmed in cross-examination that it was possible to purchase prepaid SIM cards in a name other than that of the purchaser.
	


The case for Tran


	
	Tran gave evidence in the trial. He said he was born in Vietnam and had lived in Australia since he was 14. He could not speak any Chinese language. He owned a small business with two employees. It had an annual turnover of $100,000 to $120,000.
	
	
	He was smoking heroin once or twice a month at the time. He had bought heroin from Andrew at the El Cortez Hotel, never elsewhere.
	
	
	The six day trip to Hong Kong in April 2012 was with his wife and the purpose was to get him away from his drug use. (His wife gave evidence confirming she went with him on this trip. One of the purposes was to reduce his drug use; she said that he was using drugs a couple of times a week.) He admitted that the drugs found when his house was searched were his and they were for his own use. He was in the practice of buying a ""half a ball"" of heroin (1.75g) at a time. Sometimes he and Dang shared heroin.
	
	
	Tran said that he had known Dang for about five years and described Dang as a friend. They were often in contact with each other.
	
	
	On 16 May 2012 Tran was in the vicinity of 138 The Boulevarde Strathfield because he had a date with his long-term girlfriend, Katherine Wang. They had planned four or five days earlier to meet at a restaurant in Strathfield for dinner. He had asked Dang to come with him to the dinner. Dang was going to see ""his friend to pick up his personal smoke"". Tran said later in his evidence that Dang picked him up at about 2.00pm. His plan was to meet his girlfriend at a place that served coffee and light food. He had arranged this when he bumped into her at a pub near her workplace at Parramatta. They were to meet at about 4.30, 5 o'clock. He had asked Dang to go with him to the dinner so he would not be alone with his girlfriend; ""it looks too funny if one of my wife's see her"".
	
	
	Katherine Wang gave evidence in which she confirmed that a few days before 16 May Tran had bumped into her at a pub and they arranged to meet at the restaurant in Strathfield in a few days' time at about 4.00 to 5.00pm. The arrangement was that he was to ring her when he was there and she would leave work and meet up with him. But he failed to call on the day in question. Ms Wang said that she did not know Dang at all; he had never been to any previous meetings she had with Tran.
	
	
	Tran gave evidence that Dang had been told by his friend, ""Andrew"" to go to Wonga Street (the next street parallel to Angel Road). It was the first time Dang had been to that area and he missed the turn and had to turn into the next street (Angel Street). He then turned right (into Emu Street which leads to Wonga Street). At this point Dang saw Andrew sitting in a red four-wheel drive. There was no parking at that point and so, because Andrew ""looks like he was dying to leave – like to drive off"", Dang asked Tran to ""just quickly jump out and come to the car, to that guy in the car, Andrew"".
	
	
	Tran alighted and approached the red four-wheel drive and asked Andrew ""if he got the half ball that Dang wants"". Tran said he knew Andrew because he had purchased drugs from him before. Andrew told him to get into the car. He then gave a phone to Tran, telling him to hold on to it while Andrew went away to get the drugs and he would then return. (He said that the phone was one of those found by police when he was later arrested (the 858 phone).) Tran got out of the car after Andrew had driven around into Wonga Street. Dang then called to find out where Tran was. (There is no call at this time from Dang to Tran in the telephone records.) They then met up on The Boulevarde between Wonga and Angel Streets.
	
	
	Tran said that after Andrew left, and he had to wait for him to call, he realised that he did not have any cigarettes so he asked Dang to go for a walk with him so he could buy some. They walked for a while but then he realised the shop was too far away so he said not to worry about it and they proceeded to walk back. They were then arrested.
	
	
	He was asked if he did something with the (858) phone that Andrew had given him and he replied:
	


""I had it in my hand, and then as soon as they approached me, like, I was scared, nervous, when they had the guns out, so I try to just quickly open the phone out, and then had the SIM into my mouth.

…

(A)few minutes later, they pulled me up and put me against the wall, to – for a search. And then I was a bit nervous. And then I just decide – just to spit the SIM out. ""


	
	Tran denied having used the 858 phone. He said that his Blackberry was used for messaging; one of the other phones was used for friends; and the other phone was used for work. The SIM cards in his phones were prepaid and pre-activated; that is they already had subscriber details in other names when he bought them. Phone shops did this as a service to customers so as not to delay a purchase by a need to set up an activation.
	
	
	Tran explained the large amount of money found at his home by claiming that it represented proceeds of gambling. Every time he won money he gave some to his wife to put aside and they had been saving in this fashion for over two years. He preferred to keep the cash at home in case he needed to access it for gambling because there was a $1000 withdrawal limit at a bank. In cross-examination he maintained that he won more money on poker machines than he lost; he won most of the time. He had a technique: ""Remembering the gamble, the suits. I don't wait for free games, I just wait for a pay, and then I will work out the colour suits. … I always win a lot of money … most of the times.""
	
	
	Tran's wife gave evidence confirming that the money was the proceeds of gambling but she claimed that she hid the money away because she was afraid he would take it and use more drugs.
	
	
	Tran explained that the scales that were found at his home were used to weigh drugs that he purchased to check whether he had been ""ripped off"". He said he had purchased heroin from Andrew a few times; usually at a pub, the El Cortez, where he (Tran) gambled on poker machines.
	
	
	Tran had never met either Yeung or Lam. He had never been to 138 The Boulevarde Strathfield.
	
	
	As to the man ""Andrew"", Tran said that he was of Asian appearance with short black hair. He had heard Andrew's friends refer to him as ""Jimmy"".
	


The case for Dang


	
	Mr Dang told the jury that he was born in Vietnam and came to Australia 19 years earlier. His English speaking skills were limited and he could not speak any Chinese language. He lived at Canley Heights. He received Centrelink benefits.
	
	
	On 16 May 2012 he rang Tran in the morning and they made a plan that evening to see Tran's girlfriend. He picked Tran up at 2.00 or 2.15pm. It was only on the way that he told Tran that he needed to stop to see Andrew to buy a half a ball, 1.7g of heroin. (He and Tran had discussed the proposed meeting with Tran's girlfriend two or three days before but he had not previously told Tran about needing to see Andrew.)
	
	
	Dang said he had met Andrew at the El Cortez hotel. He had bought heroin from him before, at the El Cortez. He had heard Andrew's friends refer to him as ""Jimmy"".
	
	
	Dang said he had never been to Hong Kong himself and was unaware of Tran having been there in April 2012. Although they spoke often, Tran had not told him about it.
	
	
	In relation to the phones found upon his arrest, Dang said that he had bought the Blackberry for playing games on the internet and the other had a prepaid pre-activated SIM.
	
	
	Dang gave a similar account to Tran's about missing the turn into Wonga Street; seeing Andrew; Tran alighting and going to speak with him; and Dang finding a place to park. Once he found a parking place he called Tran, or vice versa, and they met up on The Boulevarde. Tran wanted to buy cigarettes so they walked up the street a bit but found it was a long way so started to return and were then arrested.
	
	
	Dang denied knowing Yeung or Lam.
	
	
	The money he had in his pocket and in his car was to pay the builder who was to do work on his sister's house. The powder that the police found was for mixing with food to make it more nutritious for his mother. He had it in the car because of a weekend he would take his mother to either a brother's house or her friend's house and he would not be sure whether they have that kind of powder at their house. The scales were required in relation to this powder because a piece of meat a little bit bigger than a tennis ball required 1 gram for tenderisation. The money he was going to use to purchase heroin from Andrew was in an ashtray in the back of his car which the police did not find.
	
	
	Dang said that he had the scales because Andrew had a habit of selling him ""underweight stuff"".
	
	
	Dang said in cross-examination that the arrangement to meet Andrew in Wonga Street on 16 May to purchase a ""half a ball"" was made two or three days earlier at the El Cortez Hotel. Although he usually met Andrew at that hotel (which is in Canley Vale), Andrew told him that they would meet at Wonga Street, Strathfield at 3.00 or 3.05pm and “maybe he would have half a ball and he would sell it at $700”.
	
	
	Dang was cross-examined about the frequent telephone contact he had with Tran in the period leading up to 16 May. He could not recall what they spoke about except to suggest it was “just friends talking”.
	
	
	He was asked about what he had been proposing to do between meeting Andrew and going with Tran to meet Tran’s girlfriend and he said he was going to Fairfield to pay the people who were to do some work at his sister’s place and then go to Mt Pritchard to pick up his children from school (and presumably take them home to Canley Heights).
	
	
	Dang called Mr Anh David Tran to give evidence. Mr Tran described himself as a handyman. He said that he was a friend of Dang's and learned that his sister wanted some work done at her house while he was having a beer with Dang one day. The work involved repairing and renovating the garage. He gave a quotation, but not in writing, of $9500 for the job. The work included installation of a toilet. In cross-examination, he said that he would have had to look in the paper to find a plumber to do that part of the job and he would ""share my money with them"".
	
	
	It also emerged in cross-examination that Mr Tran was a cousin to Dang’s sister. He said that he usually received money in advance in order to pay for materials. In this case, Dang's sister wanted to pay him the entire amount in advance, in cash, because she didn’t like to keep money in the house. She told him that Dang would bring him the money. Dang was supposed to come to Mr Tran’s home on 16 May 2012 but he did not arrive. He heard a couple of days later that Dang had some trouble with the police so Mr Tran proceeded to work on another job.
	


Unreasonable verdict principles


	
	A sufficient and succinct summary of well-known principles to be applied when determining a ground of appeal asserting that a verdict of guilty is unreasonable or cannot be supported in the context of a circumstantial evidence case was provided in Gilham v R [2012] NSWCCA 131:
	


“[465] Section 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 provides that a verdict may be set aside if it is unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence. As the High Court recently confirmed in SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; (2011) 243 CLR 400 at [14], when considering whether or not the verdict of a jury was unreasonable the appellate court is to make its own independent assessment of the evidence both as to sufficiency and quality. The question that an appeal court is required to determine is whether, notwithstanding that there is evidence upon which a jury might convict, ‘nonetheless it would be dangerous in all the circumstances to allow the verdict of guilty to stand’: M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; (1994) 181 CLR 487 at 492-493. Only in circumstances where a doubt experienced by a court of criminal appeal can be resolved by the jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence can the court conclude that no miscarriage of justice has occurred: M at 494 quoted with approval in SKA at [13].

[466] The case against the applicant is a circumstantial one. As McClellan CJ at CL discussed in Wood v R [2012] NSWCCA 21 at [50]-[53], where a case is circumstantial ‘the jury cannot return a verdict of guilty unless the circumstances are such as to be inconsistent with any reasonable hypothesis other than the guilt of the accused’: quoting Barca v The Queen [1975] HCA 42; (1975) 133 CLR 82 at 104 (Gibbs, Stephen and Mason JJ), citing Peacock v The King [1911] HCA 66; (1911) 13 CLR 619 at 634; see also Plomp v The Queen [1963] HCA 44; (1963) 110 CLR 234 at 252. However, a circumstantial case must be considered holistically. The court must weigh and consider the totality of the admissible evidence before reaching a conclusion, on the whole of the evidence, that it was open to the jury to be persuaded beyond reasonable doubt of guilt or, in the alternative, that a doubt persists such that it would be dangerous to allow the verdict of guilty to stand: R v Hillier [2007] HCA 13; (2007) 228 CLR 618 at [48]-[49] (Gummow, Hayne and Crennan JJ). Tortuous reasoning in order to explain away every individual circumstance as being consistent with innocence should not be engaged in: R v Micallef [2002] NSWCCA 480; (2002) 136 A Crim R 127 at [42] (Dunford J); Burrell v R [2009] NSWCCA 193 at [55] (Giles JA).”

Facts established


	
	I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the 858 phone was, at all material times, in the possession of Tran. I am also satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Tran was ""Jimmy"".
	
	
	The 858 phone was found in Tran's possession upon his arrest. He tried to destroy and/or discard the SIM card. There is no reasonable explanation for this other than that he knew it would link him to Yeung and the consignment. (This evidence was only admitted in the case against Tran.)
	
	
	Given Tran's possession of the phone at the time of the call at 3.07pm, there is no reasonable possibility other than that he was involved in the second “Jimmy” conversation with Yeung at that time. It follows that he was involved in the first “Jimmy” conversation with Yeung at 2.53pm.
	
	
	The substantial point made in the submissions for the applicant in an endeavour to avoid these conclusions was that the times indicated in the surveillance log indicated that Tran would have already been arrested, or was in the process of being arrested, at 3.07pm. I accept the Crown’s submissions on this point. That argument calls for too much precision in the recording of times in that log, aside from the error that is conceded. FA Stipnieks' evidence was that he saw the appellants at the place where they were arrested at ""about 3.06pm"" (AB 565.35). His times were based on the log but it was conceded that such times were out by almost two minutes. If this is correct, the arrests were effected at about 3.08pm. That is consistent with the sounds of yelling within 138 The Boulevarde as recorded by the listening device commencing at 3.08.44.
	
	
	Regardless of the foregoing, what is incontrovertible is that (a) Tran had the 858 phone when he was arrested; (b) a short time earlier (at 2.53pm), Yeung had spoken with “Jimmy” at the same time as a phone available to Yeung had been in contact with the 858 phone; and (c) a phone available to Yeung was again in contact with the 858 phone at 3.07pm and he referred to the other party once more as “Jimmy”. No other reasonable possibility arises than that Tran was the other party to the conversation with Yeung.
	
	
	I am also satisfied that Tran had the 858 phone when it was involved in earlier contact with Yeung on 11 and 14 May 2012. Tran's claim that he only came into possession of the phone at about 2.50pm on 16 May is not credible. He explained to the jury that Andrew was in Wonga Street, Strathfield (an unusual location compared to prior dealings at the El Cortez Hotel) to sell 1.75g of heroin to Dang but Andrew did not have heroin and had to go away to get it. In these circumstances, he asked Tran to hold on to his phone while he was gone.
	
	
	The whole story that there was a person by the name of Andrew Lo in Wonga Street is incredible. The defence case was that it was sheer coincidence that Yeung was arranging to meet someone at 3.00pm in relation to a large quantity of imported heroin and a small time drug dealer, who in the past only sold minor quantities of heroin to Dang at a hotel in Canley Vale, decided days before to conduct a transaction with him around the corner at the very same time.
	
	
	The translator who prepared the transcript of the listening device material included ""Andrew Lo"" as the phonetic sound of English words in one of the recorded conversations. It is entirely feasible, as the Crown suggested in this Court, that the sound, in Yeung's undoubtedly accented voice, would be similar to ""Angel Road"". That makes sense of the reference in the same sentence to ""the twenty second"" which is consistent with the address of 22 Angel Road sent by text by Yeung to the 858 phone on 11 May 2012. Senior counsel for Tran conceded the latter but not the former (27.3.15 at T7.14).
	
	
	It was suggested as a reasonable possibility that “Andrew Lo” might have been the anticipated recipient of the heroin. But no reasonably possible explanation was advanced for why he would have known days in advance of a need to be in the area at 3.00pm on 16 May when the delivery of the consignment only materialised that afternoon.
	
	
	Once it is accepted that the 858 phone was Tran's, or even at least that it was in his possession from 2.53pm on 16 May 2012, discrete aspects of the defence cases are rendered incapable of acceptance. One such aspect was that Tran could not speak Cantonese. Another was that he was not known as “Jimmy” by anyone who gave evidence (he was at least known by that name to Yeung).
	
	
	Another submission concerned the fact that there was no evidence of anyone, such as Dang, contacting the 858 phone other than Yeung. That is true. Tran was found with four phones. It is entirely conceivable that he had a purpose in having each of them and that, in relation to the 858 phone, the purpose was for contacting the person with whom he was dealing in relation to the consignment. If it had not been found in his personal possession, it would not have been traced to him, given the subscription details did not identify him.
	
	
	It was submitted that the evidence of Tran concerning his reasons for being in the vicinity of 138 The Boulevarde (so that Dang could meet “Andrew Lo”) found support in other evidence. I have dealt with most of those reasons except for the one that referred to the observation of “they” getting out of a Nissan Navara and the registered owner of that vehicle “had some 2001 supply drugs offences”. There is no clear explanation for this in the evidence. There is no evidence that the registered owner was an “Andrew Lo”. Sometimes in a case such as this there are matters that are mysterious. But I do not accept that this is a matter that detracts from what the evidence otherwise establishes.
	


The narrative established


	
	With an acceptance of the proposition that Tran was ""Jimmy"", it was well open to the jury to accept that the evidence established the following narrative.
	
	
	Yeung and Lam came to Australia from Hong Kong and Tran had visited Hong Kong a short time (a month or two) before 16 May 2012.
	
	
	Each of the known participants, Dang, Tran, Yeung and Lam acquired mobile phones a short time (a few weeks) before 16 May 2012. None of the subscriber details were in their names.
	
	
	The consignment containing heroin was sent from Hong Kong on 12 May and arrived in Sydney on 14 May 2012.
	
	
	Yeung was in phone contact with Tran on 11 May 2012 (including via a text message which contained an address two doors down the street from 138 The Boulevarde). He was in further contact with Tran on the evening of 14 May.
	
	
	FA Dib attempted to deliver the consignment to the house across the road from 138 The Boulevarde, Strathfield, at about 11.50am on 16 May 2012. No-one was home and he left a note. At 1.03pm he received a call from Yeung asking him to deliver it to No 138 and he said he would do so in about an hour. This provided the first expected time that the consignment would be received by Yeung.
	
	
	FA Dib delivered the consignment to Yeung at about 1.50pm. The first person Yeung called after receiving the consignment was Tran who he rang almost immediately (at 2.02pm). A meeting was arranged for 3.00pm. Tran immediately (at 2.03pm) rang Dang. Yeung contacted Lam, telling him about the 3.00pm meeting. Thereafter he spoke to other people (including his superior overseas) as he set about unpacking and recovering the heroin that was expected to be within the table-tennis bats. He soon became concerned that the substance was not the same as what it usually was.
	
	
	Tran rang Dang again at 2.23pm. Dang picked him up and they travelled together to Strathfield. By about 2.50pm, Yeung was well and truly concerned that the substance he had recovered from the bats was half the weight it should have been and may not have been heroin. His telephone conversations with others include discussion of the possibility of ""recycling"" (which I infer meant adding something to increase the bulk of the substance). When Tran rang Yeung at 2.53pm, it was sufficiently important for Yeung to interrupt a conversation with his overseas superior to answer; he referred to Tran by the name ""Jimmy"" and told him to wait.
	
	
	The appellants were in the vicinity of 138 The Boulevarde by this time. They walked around the area, sometimes apart but mostly together. It is apparent they were looking out for any possible police surveillance. (The record of the police observations included that they were engaging in “counter surveillance""). Tran walked past 138 The Boulevarde, on either side of the road, five times.
	
	
	At 2.56pm, Yeung reminded his overseas superior that he had previously said that ""Jimmy"" had been told to wait at the end of the street. He made reference a short time later to ""Ah Gor"" that Jimmy had arrived and was waiting nearby. When “Jimmy” (i.e. Tran) rang at about 3.07pm, Yeung again put him off by explaining that there were problems and asking if he would not mind waiting.
	
	
	Yeung received further advice or instructions from ""Ah Gor"" and then said ""alright, I'll just call brother Jimmy then"". He did not get the opportunity as the police by this stage had determined to move in and affect arrests.
	
	
	As Tran saw the approaching officers, with guns drawn, he quickly removed the SIM card from the 858 phone and threw it away. (This evidence was admitted only against Tran.) It is significant that he did this in relation to the phone that had been in contact with Yeung as opposed to any of the three other phones in his possession.
	
	
	Tran was found to have some $150,000 in cash at his home. This indicated that he was financially able to engage in the acquisition and supply of large quantities of prohibited drugs. His claim of gambling as an alternative source for this money lacked credibility. He provided evidence of his successful betting endeavours but nothing in relation to his losing bets. His claim that he was invariably successful was implausible.
	
	
	Tran's possession of four mobile phones also supported the proposition that he was involved in significant drug supply activity. His alternative explanation that he used one for messaging, one for work, another for friends and that he had received the fourth from ""Andrew"" did not command acceptance.
	
	
	Dang was found to be in possession at the scene of his arrest, namely on his person and in his car, of some $9000. This tended to support the proposition that he was involved in drug supply activity. His alternative explanation of having been given that money by his sister in order to pay her builders was implausible. He was also found to be in possession of a substance capable of being used as a cutting agent. His alternative explanation that this was a marinade and meat tenderiser for his mother's food was incredible on its own; but more so when considering it was found in a bag that also contained scales that had been used in the past to weigh heroin and cocaine.
	
	
	There was an argument that the amounts of money found in the possession of the appellants were inconsistent with the wholesale value of the heroin, said to be between $822,300 and $959,350. However, the Crown did not submit that this money was intended to be used to pay for the consignment. There was no evidence as to how the drugs had been or would be paid for, or how such transactions are typically carried out. The significance of these sums of money was more to show that large sums of money were available to the appellants, consistent with involvement in drug supply activity. For example, Tran owned a small business with a turnover of between $100,000 and $120,000 per year and, the Crown argued, his possession of almost $150,000 in cash secreted around his house was not credibly explained. Dang was on Centrelink benefits.
	
	
	The coincidence that the three phones found in Tran's possession, one of the two found in Dang's possession, the three phones found in Yeung's possession, and the one phone found in Lam's possession had all been activated in the three weeks or so prior to 16 May, none of them in their own names, was another circumstance linking the three to the consignment delivered on that day. (Something was sought to be made of the fact that it is possible to buy a pre-paid SIM card already activated in another name; but that does not detract from the fact that the applicants had phones that were not in their own names.)
	


The defence cases did not give rise to a reasonable doubt


	
	The overall version of events provided by the appellants was implausible. It was to the effect that Tran was to meet his girlfriend at a restaurant in Strathfield at about 4.30 or 5.00pm. Mr Dang was to accompany him. For this purpose, Dang, who lived at Canley Heights, picked Tran up from Tran's home in Fairfield Heights at about 2.00pm. So far as Tran was concerned, they were going to meet his girlfriend some 2½ to 3 hours later at a Strathfield café. But after Dang picked him up, he told Tran that he had to meet his drug dealer in Wonga Street, Strathfield. Dang was then going to drive back out west to Fairfield to pay his sister’s builders and then go to Mt Pritchard to pick up his children. After all of that, they would then return to Strathfield to meet with Tran’s girlfriend.
	
	
	Another aspect of implausibility was that Dang had previously purchased heroin from “Andrew” at the El Cortez Hotel at Canley Vale; but for some reason that was not explained, a few days before 16 May 2012 Andrew told Dang that he “may” be able to supply him with some heroin on the 16th in Wonga Street, Strathfield at 3.00 or 3.05pm which, coincidentally, was the time that Yeung had arranged to meet a person which he could only have arranged after the consignment was delivered at 1.50pm that day.
	
	
	Further rendering this implausible is that neither Dang nor Tran were daily users of heroin and they were in the habit of sharing between themselves. There was no need for them to buy heroin from “Andrew” on 16 May; Tran already had some at home.
	
	
	The claim by Dang that the $9120 in his possession was to pay his sister's builders was lacking in credibility too. The evidence of Mr Anh David Tran about the arrangement to do the work was far from compelling.
	
	
	Dang's credibility suffered as well from his claim that the dimethylsulfone found in his car was used for entirely innocent purposes and not as a cutting agent for drugs (aside from the implausibility of the innocent purposes he claimed). He said in re-examination that it was not a substance that could be mixed with heroin that was smoked. However, the appellants were in the habit of sharing their heroin; they both smoked it; and the heroin found in Tran's possession was mixed with dimethylsulfone.
	
	
	The jury would have been forgiven for regarding any credibility Tran and Dang had as evaporating when they heard them each claim that ""Andrew"" was also known as ""Jimmy"". This was obviously an attempt to suggest that the ""Jimmy"" to whom Yeung spoke was ""Andrew Lo"". Acceptance of what I regard as incontrovertible evidence that ""Jimmy"" was Tran, the jury would have seen this as a blatant attempt to manufacture a defence that fitted in with the Crown evidence, taking advantage of the phonetic spelling of ""Andrew Lo"" in the transcript of Yeung's 2.56pm conversation but clumsily failing to recognise that if Yeung actually mentioned that name, in the same conversation he also referred to ""Jimmy"".
	


Conclusion


	
	Having made an independent assessment of the evidence I am satisfied that it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of both appellants.
	


Dang Ground 2


	
	This ground is concerned with the admission in the case concerning Dang of evidence that Tran had travelled to Hong Kong in April 2012 and that he was found to have a large sum of cash at his home. It was contended by counsel for Dang that there was no evidence that his client was aware of either fact and so allowing such evidence to be admitted in his case was ""severely prejudicial"".
	
	
	The ""no evidence"" point is correct in terms of direct evidence. But it was well open to the jury to infer knowledge by Dang of both matters, having regard to the fact that the pair were in contact with each other by telephone an average of 15 times a day. Counsel's response when this suggestion was made at the hearing was to submit that such an inference was ""weak"". The fact remains that it was only one of a number of circumstances that need to be viewed as a whole and not in a piecemeal fashion: Gilham v R [2012] NSWCCA 131 at [466].
	
	
	The evidence was admissible and there was no legitimate basis for Dang to be tried separately.
	


Conclusion


	
	I propose the following orders in each case:
	


Leave to appeal against conviction granted.

Appeal against conviction dismissed.


	
	DAVIES J: I have had the opportunity of reading in draft the judgment of R A Hulme J. I agree with his Honour's analysis of the evidence and his reasons for the orders that his Honour proposes.
	
	
	In relation to the grounds raised by each of the appellants that the verdict was unreasonable and could not be supported by the evidence I only wish to make brief additional observations.
	
	
	The most significant matter was that the telephone ending in 858 was undoubtedly in the possession of Tran when he was arrested. The SIM card from that phone was retrieved, having been discarded by Tran at the time of his arrest. Possession of that phone inevitably leads to the conclusion that Tran must have been the person referred to as ""Jimmy"" with the further corollary that Tran was, contrary to his evidence, able to speak Cantonese.
	
	
	Those matters significantly dented Tran's credibility and undermined the innocent explanation for his presence in The Boulevarde at the relevant time. It had the effect of impairing Dang's credibility also because by the time of the trial he and Tran asserted that the reason for their presence at that location was for the dinner engagement with Tran's girlfriend. That explanation was to be contrasted, in any event, with Dang's initial explanation for being there when spoken to by the police on the day he was arrested.
	
	
	Further, whatever may have been the meaning of the Cantonese words translated as ""Andrew Lo"", assuming in the appellants’ favour that there was such a person rather than it being a reference to a street address, such a person could not have been Jimmy (as both Tran and Dang asserted) by virtue of the telephone conversation recorded at 2:56pm on 16 May where both Jimmy and Andrew Lo were identified as distinct persons.
	
	
	R A Hulme J has drawn attention to the other unlikely aspects of the explanations put forward by both Tran and Dang in the face of the persuasive evidentiary material led by the Crown to demonstrate their involvement in the attempted possession.
	
	
	My own reading of the evidence satisfies me that it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of both appellants.
	
	
	I have read also the judgment of Bellew J regarding the sentence appeals. I agree with his Honour’s reasons and the orders he proposes.
	
	
	BELLEW J: I have had the advantage of reading, in draft, the judgment of R A Hulme J in relation to the appeals of the respective appellants against their convictions. I agree with his Honour’s conclusions and with the orders that he proposes.
	


THE APPLICATIONS FOR LEAVE TO APPEAL AGAINST SENTENCE


	
	Each appellant seeks leave to appeal against the sentences set out in the judgment of R A Hulme J at [3].
	


THE APPELLANT TRAN – THE GROUND OF APPEAL

His Honour erred in finding that the appellant intended to acquire the entire consignment of narcotics available at 138 The Boulevard

The findings of the sentencing judge


	
	The relevant findings of the sentencing judge were in the following terms (commencing at ROS 6):
	


“Mr Wendler on behalf of Mr Tran submitted that I should find that he intended to purchase and hence possess a quantity of the heroin but not the entire consignment. He submitted that this was supported by:

The lack of money found by the police to purchase all of the $327,000 wholesale value of the heroin. At best there was a total of $150,000 plus the money found on Dang or in his car;

Content of the phone call referrable to third parties (for example, the condition of the heroin) reference to Andrew Lo just after 3pm;

The fact that Mr Tran was a heroin user. Not only did Mr Tran give evidence during the trial that he was a heroin user but what was found at his home.

Mr Kumarasinhe for Mr Dang adopted the submission that I should find he did not intend to take possession of the entire heroin.

I find, however, beyond reasonable doubt that both were there to takepossession of the whole consignment for the following reasons:

Both Mr Tran and Mr Dang were drug dealers making use of multiple mobile phones with SIM cards in false names, having access to large amounts of cash and equipped with scales and a cutting agent;

Both offenders were outside number 138 The Boulevard just over an hour after the consignment had been delivered and Mr Tran was virtually the first, if not the first person Mr Yeung telephoned when it arrived;

Mr Yeung was concerned about the weight of the powder and that it wasabout half what it should have been against the background of the impending meeting with ""Jimmy"", who was Mr Tran, at 3pm.

Seriousness of the offence

As far as Mr Tran is concerned whether he was to be actively involved in the distribution or dissemination of the drug cannot be determined, but I am satisfied that he was more than a mere courier engaged to pick up the consignment and pass them on to others. This emerges from matters to which I have referred to earlier. I find he was to receive the drugs and deal with them prior to their next step along the path to their commercial distribution. This was an essential link in the chain of a sophisticated international enterprise.

The total pure weight of heroin was 822.3 grams, which is over 400 times the marketable quantity of heroin (which is two grams). It is slightly more than half the commercial quantity, (which is 1.5 kilograms). The wholesale value of the heroin was $327,825 and the street value between $822,000 and $959,000. As the Crown submits I find both Tran and Dang knew exactly what drug they were dealing with and the approximate quantity they were attempting to possess. Although each had a comparatively low level heroin addiction, I find the reasonable inference is that each was motivated by profit to undertake this dangerous exercise of obtaining the heroin.”

Submissions of the appellant


	
	Senior counsel for the appellant Tran drew attention to the fact that the Crown had submitted at the trial that providing the jury were satisfied that the appellants had attempted to possess more than two grams of the drug, the offence would be established. Senior counsel described this as a “telling submission”, and argued that it reflected the Crown’s awareness that the evidence fell short of establishing that the appellants intended to take possession of the entirety of the consignment.
	
	
	Senior counsel submitted that for a number of reasons, the evidence did not support the finding of the trial judge. It was submitted, in particular, that the purchase of the entirety of the consignment, even at its wholesale value, was well beyond the demonstrated financial capacity of either or both of the appellants. In this regard, and accepting that the drug would have been sold at its wholesale value of $327,000.00, senior counsel relied on the fact that:
	



	
	the appellant had no cash on his person at the time of his arrest;
	
	
	Dang had slightly in excess of $10,000.00 in cash on his person at the time of his arrest;
	
	
	although the appellant was found to have $146,000.00 in cash at his home, this remained short of the amount required to purchase the entire consignment;
	
	
	it was unlikely, in the extreme, that a consignment such as this would be given to someone who was not able to hand over the necessary amount of cash at the same time.
	



	
	It was further submitted that the appellant’s possession of mobile phones and SIM cards in false names, and his possession of scales and a cutting agent, said nothing about his capacity to purchase the entire consignment. It was submitted that such factors were equally consistent with drug dealing at a lower level.
	
	
	Ultimately, senior counsel submitted that the evidence supported a conclusion that the appellant intended to purchase some smaller amount from the consignment, commensurate with the amount of money found in Dang’s possession at the time of his arrest. In the alternative, it was submitted that even when combined, the demonstrated financial capacity of the appellants was limited to being able to purchase less than half of the total consignment.
	


Submissions of the Crown


	
	The Crown emphasised that the finding of the sentencing judge was that the appellants were at the premises to take possession of - as opposed to purchase - the whole consignment. The Crown submitted that in circumstances where both appellants were found to be drug dealers, an amount sufficient to pay for the consignment was able to be derived from its sale. In these circumstances, it was submitted that the fact that neither appellant had access to an amount of cash sufficient to pay for the entire consignment was of no significance.
	
	
	The Crown also pointed to the evidence that the appellants, in their capacity as drug dealers, made use of multiple mobile phones and SIM cards in false names, had access to large amounts of cash, and were equipped with scales and a cutting agent. It was submitted that these circumstances were consistent with drug dealing on a large scale, and thus consistent with the acquisition of a correspondingly large quantity of heroin.
	
	
	The Crown also relied upon a number of other circumstances in support of the finding of the sentencing judge. These circumstances included:
	



	
	the presence of the appellants at the Strathfield address within a short time of the consignment being delivered;
	
	
	the fact that the appellant Tran was one of the first (if not the first) person telephoned by Yeung when the consignment arrived;
	
	
	the references in the listening device material to the fact that there was no need to unpack the bags.
	


Consideration


	
	The finding that both of the appellants were drug dealers was not challenged. The various items found in the possession of the appellants, and at the home of the appellant Tran, admit of no other conclusion.
	
	
	As the Crown pointed out, it is important to bear in mind that the sentencing judge did not find that the appellants were present at the Strathfield address to purchase the entirety of the heroin. He found that they were there to acquire it. That is an important distinction. Although there was no direct evidence of the precise nature and extent of the relationship between the appellants and those others involved in the arrival of the consignment, it is clear that all of them were, as one might expect, acquainted. The presence of the appellants at the Strathfield address did not come about by chance. It was obviously pre-arranged and directly connected to the arrival of the consignment.
	
	
	In all of these circumstances, the inference that the appellants were at the Strathfield premises to obtain the drug for the purposes of selling it was overwhelming. The cost of the acquisition of the consignment could obviously be generated from its subsequent sale by the appellants in their drug dealing activities. Given this, the fact that neither of them was in possession of, or had immediate access to, an amount of cash equivalent to its wholesale value is of little or no significance. In my view, the evidence amply supported the finding of the sentencing judge.
	
	
	Finally, it was not incumbent upon the Crown, at trial, to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the appellants intended to obtain possession of the whole of the consignment. It was open to the Crown to put to the jury that the offence was made out if it was established that the appellants attempted to take possession of 2 grams. Whether, for the purposes of sentence, the evidence established an intention to obtain possession of a greater amount was a separate question entirely.
	
	
	For all of these reasons this ground is not made out.
	


THE APPELLANT DANG

THE GROUNDS OF APPEAL

Ground 1 – The sentencing judge erred in finding that in descending order, the appellant Tran was the most culpable, the appellant Dang the next culpable and the co-offender Yeung to be the least culpable

Ground 4 - The appellant has a justifiable sense of grievance having regard to the sentence imposed upon the offender Shing Yuet Yeung


	
	These grounds overlap to some extent and it is appropriate that they be dealt with together.
	


The findings of the sentencing judge


	
	The sentencing judge said (at ROS 8):
	


“As far as Mr Dang is concerned the Crown submits, and I accept, that his role was subordinate to that of Mr Tran; but it is not possible to be any more specific than that other than to say that his role was not menial or limited role (sic). What he actually did was to drive and accompany Tran to the proposed meeting and had with him cash, a cutting agent and scales. He was to assist Mr Tran as his willing subordinate.

The seriousness of the offence committed by Mr Dang is also high, although not as high as that of Mr Tran. When the following factors are taken into account it can be seen that this is the case. His subordinate role to Mr Tran, which was not a menial one; the amount and value of the drug; his financial motive and knowing what the drug was and it's (sic) approximate quantity.”


	
	His Honour then said (commencing at ROS 14):
	


“Considerations of parity apply. In March this year Judge Bennettsentenced 25 year old Mr Yeung to imprisonment for 6 years and 9 (scil. 10) months with a non-parole of 4 years and 10 months. This followed what he described as a discount for his plea of guilty in the Local Court of ""not quite 25% but near enough to it"". This means his starting head sentence was close enough to 9 years. There was no evidence before the Judge of Yeung having any prior criminal history. Yeung lived in Hong Kong and was granted a visa to enter Australia some months prior to the present offence. He represented to the authorities that he would be attending university here. Various rooms of thehouse at number 138 The Boulevard were in fact sub-leased to differentpeople and Mr Yeung sub-leased one of these rooms for the purposes of thiscriminal venture. He can be heard on the listening device tape, unpacking the

consignment when it arrived at the house. His Honour found his role to be a ""mignon"" of two other offenders - Mr Lam and another man - having managerial roles but nonetheless a role greater than that of a courier. His Honour found he was motivated by ""youthful recklessness with a failure to truly appreciate the significance of the wrongdoing and what he was engaged upon"" and found him to be contrite and insightful into his offending. He also took into account his sentence would be harder because he had limited English and no family in Australia. However a complicating factor is that other uncharged similar offences were taken into account so that the present offence was not an isolated offence.

The Crown submitted Mr Tran and Mr Dang were more culpable than Mr Yeung because of the more serious role they played. On the other hand Mr Wendler submitted, as did Mr Kumarasinhe submit, that Mr Yeung's criminality was greater than they because, amongst other things, of his involvement in other uncharged importations on other occasions and the fact that his very purpose in coming to Australia in the first place was to be involved in his criminal activity.

When considering these submissions it is important to bear in mind theseriousness of a present offence committed by all these offenders and the appropriate ultimate sentence to be imposed after taking into account all objective and subjective circumstances. The extent to which uncharged offences may be taken into account on sentencing was considered at length by Spigelman CJ in R v JCW [2000] NSWCCA 209. It is appropriate to take into account such offences to reject any claim to mitigation and attendant reduction of an otherwise appropriate sentence, and not as a circumstance of aggravation.

As to the seriousness of the present offence that was committed in descending order I consider Mr Tran to have been the most culpable, Mr Dang to have been the next culpable and Mr Yeung the least culpable. Although Mr Yeung was sentenced on the basis that the present offence was not an isolated one this was balanced to a certain extent by Judge Bennett's finding that Yeung was motivated by ""youthful recklessness"" with limited appreciation of his wrongdoing. However I consider Mr Dang is not very sharp and despite his age somewhat immature.

Mr Yeung also has the most favourable subjective case. He had a finding of being contrite, whereas the others have not and like Mr Dang, had no prior criminal history.

Significant features distinguishing Mr Tran from Mr Dang are his greater role, his previous conviction for drug supply and his less favourable rehabilitative prospects.

When all his factors are balanced out I do not consider Mr Yeung, for example, could have a justifiable sense of grievance about the sentence I intend to impose upon Mr Dang and Mr Tran notwithstanding the discount Mr Yeung received for his early plea of guilty. Particularly in the case of Mr Tran it needs to be borne in mind as Malcolm CJ said in R v Clinch (1994) A Crim R 301 at 306: ""...the severity of a sentence increases at a rate greater than any increase in the length of a sentence.""

The sentencing of the co-offender Yeung


	
	Yeung pleaded guilty to one charge of attempting to possess a marketable quantity of a border controlled drug, namely heroin. He was sentenced by his Honour Judge Bennett to imprisonment for 6 years and 10 months, with a non-parole period of 4 years and 10 months. In the course of Yeung’s sentence proceedings, the Crown sought to argue that the evidence supported a conclusion that he had been involved in the importation of two other consignments of heroin. The Crown submitted that those consignments formed part of the course of conduct in which Yeung committed the offence to which he had pleaded guilty.
	
	
	Having considered the evidence, Judge Bennett rejected the Crown’s submission and concluded (at ROS 31) that he could not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Yeung was a participant in the first of the other importations relied upon by the Crown. Although satisfied that Yeung was a participant in the second, his Honour was not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that such venture involved an importation of heroin.
	
	
	The nature and extent of the involvement of Yeung in the present importation is set out in the judgment of R A Hulme J. His Honour’s observations of such involvement are consistent with those made by Judge Bennett when sentencing Yeung. In particular, in terms of the role played by Yeung in the offending, Judge Bennett concluded (at ROS 36):
	


“The facts and circumstances relevant to the charge to which he has pleaded guilty, of themselves provide compelling evidence of the role he engaged upon. I note the Crown’s submissions that within less than twenty minutes of accepting delivery of the table tennis bats he was recorded as speaking on the phone complaining of their condition and the quantity of the powder, which was half of what he was expecting.”


	
	Judge Bennett dealt comprehensively with Yeung’s subjective case. At the time of sentence, Yeung was 24 years of age. He had been born in Hong Kong and was the youngest of 4 children. He had lived with his family until he travelled to Australia in early 2012 which culminated in his arrest. His Honour found that his parents were supportive of him in his formative years to adulthood although they were not aware of the offending.
	
	
	His Honour concluded (at ROS 34):
	


“According to what is reported he did not in any true sense, in my judgment, seek to justify his crime or explain it against any circumstance of depravation (sic) or mistreatment. He acknowledged his family’s economic circumstances which were modest and which left him with little or no opportunity for material gain comparable to that of his associates.

His misconduct from which his opportunity for education was disrupted and his disregard for his parents who had sacrificed for him and his siblings according to their means, in consequence of which he associated with social peers until his desire for material things led him into criminality with negative associates and his commission of the offence charged for financial gain, is all acknowledged by him.

It could hardly be said that through selfserving representations he has sought to blame his decision upon extraneous forces over which he had no control. I accept the representations attributed to him as expressions of remorse and contrition faced with a recognition that he has done wrong and must now pay the price that his misconduct has earned”.


	
	His Honour accepted (at ROS 37) that Yeung had demonstrated contrition by his plea of guilty. He was also satisfied that such contrition was demonstrated by statements made by Yeung to a psychologist. His Honour concluded (at ROS 2) that in light of Yeung’s plea of guilty, a discount of “not quite twenty five per cent but near enough to it” would be applied. He subsequently acknowledged (at ROS 40) that the discount he in fact applied was marginally in excess of that. His Honour also had regard (at ROS 37) to the necessity for any sentence to reflect considerations of general deterrence, and he concluded that Yeung had “some prospects” of rehabilitation.
	


Submissions of the appellant


	
	Counsel for the appellant Dang submitted that Yeung had been “involved with additional consignments of imported narcotics” and was “part of a wider narcotics importation syndicate”. It was further submitted that on any objective assessment, the role played by Yeung was objectively higher than that of the appellant.
	
	
	It was further submitted that even allowing for the plea of guilty entered by Yeung, (which, it was argued, was “inevitable” given the strength of the case against him) it was submitted that his involvement was of a demonstrably higher order than that of the appellant. It was submitted that in circumstances where Yeung had received a lesser “practical term of imprisonment” the appellant had a justifiable sense of grievance, and that a lesser sentence was warranted.
	


Submissions of the Crown


	
	As to ground 1, the Crown submitted that there was no demonstrated error in the sentencing judge’s finding as to the roles played by those involved. It was submitted that the evidence supported the conclusion that Yeung’s role was essentially limited to receiving the consignment before passing it on to some other person(s) and that in these circumstances, the sentencing judge had correctly concluded that Yeung was the least culpable.
	
	
	As to ground 4, the Crown submitted that it was necessary for the appellant to point to a marked and unjustified disparity. It was submitted that application of the relevant principles demonstrated that no such disparity was established. The Crown also pointed to the fact that Yeung had entered a plea of guilty before the Local Court, and had received the benefit of a significant discount which had not been available to the appellant, who had chosen to go to trial.
	


Consideration and conclusion


	
	The submissions advanced by counsel for the appellant in support of these grounds were based, to a large extent, on the proposition that Yeung had been involved in additional importations of narcotics, and was thus part of a wider “narcotics importation syndicate”. Whilst that was certainly the Crown’s position in Yeung’s sentence proceedings, Judge Bennett was not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that this was the case. The submissions of counsel for the appellant in this regard tended to ignore Judge Bennett’s conclusions.
	
	
	Moreover in my view, there was no error on the part of the sentencing judge in concluding that Yeung was the least culpable out of himself and the two appellants. On the evidence, Yeung’s role was essentially a practical one. It was to receive the consignment and pass it on to somebody else who occupied a more senior position in the hierarchy.
	
	
	The sentencing judge found that Yeung had the most favourable subjective case. He also found that the appellant had not displayed remorse or contrition. Counsel for the appellant did not take issue with either finding. In contrast, Yeung was found by Judge Bennett to be contrite.
	
	
	Yeung also had the benefit of a discount to reflect the utilitarian value of his plea of guilty. Counsel for the appellant submitted that such a plea was inevitable. Whether this was so is not to the point. The fact is that the plea entitled Yeung to a substantial discount to which the appellant was not similarly entitled. That explains, at least in part, the different sentences which were imposed.
	
	
	The doctrine of parity in sentencing is a norm of equal justice and is an essential element of the rule of law. The principle of equal justice requires, as far as the law permits, that like be treated alike and that differential treatment be meted out in order to reflect differences between those that are relevantly different: Green v R; Quinn v R [2011] HCA 49; (2011) 244 CLR 462 at [28].
	
	
	In Sinkovich v R [2011] NSWCCA 90 Hoeben J (as his Honour then was) said (at [70]):
	


“[70] It should be kept in mind that a ground of appeal asserting disparity is concerned with markedly and unjustifiably different sentences imposed on different offenders. In England v R; Phanith v R [2009] NSWCCA 274 Howie J (McClellan CJ at CL and Fullerton J agreeing) said at [61] - [63]:

""[61] ... A ground asserting disparity is concerned with such markedly and unjustifiably different sentences imposed on co-offenders that they give rise to a genuine feeling on the part of an impartial observer that justice has not been achieved because one offender has been unfairly treated having regard to the sentence passed upon the co-offender. Yet frequently, as in this case, the Court is asked to trawl through the sentencing remarks and the facts and circumstances of the two offenders in detail in order to dissect and weigh every aspect of their competing objective and subjective facts to see whether some variation, however minor, should be made to the sentence of the person who, it is asserted, has a grievance.

[62] It should be borne in mind that the High Court's decisions on this area of appellate intervention speak of ""gross"", ""marked"", ""glaring"" or ""manifest"" disparity. These terms are used throughout the judgments in Lowe v The Queen [1984] HCA 46; 154 CLR 606. Another way of considering the issue is to ask whether the two sentences give rise to an appearance that justice has not been done: per Gibbs CJ at 610 and Dawson J at 623. It should be recalled that the sentences being compared in that case were, on the one hand, a sentence of 6 years imprisonment and, on the other, a non-custodial sentence.

[63] No different approach was taken in Postiglione v The Queen [1997] HCA 26; 189 CLR 295. Dawson and Gaudron JJ in their joint judgment stated at 301:

""However, the parity principle, as identified and expounded in Lowe v The Queen recognises that equal justice requires that, as between co-offenders, there should not be a marked disparity which gives rise to ""a justifiable sense of grievance"". If there is, the sentence in issue should be reduced, notwithstanding that it is otherwise appropriate ""and within the permissible range of sentencing options.""

Gummow J stated at 323:

""The principle for which Lowe is authority appears to be that the Court of Criminal Appeal intervenes where the difference between the two sentences is manifestly excessive and such as to engender a justifiable sense of grievance by giving the appearance, in the mind of an objective observer, that justice has not been done.""

His Honour then quoted with approval from a decision of Callaway JA in R v Taudevin [1996] 2 VR 402 in which it was pointed out that the important words in considering the issue of disparity were ""manifestly"" ""justifiable"" and ""objective"" and emphasising that the difference between the sentences must be ""clearly excessive"".""


	
	There was no error in the finding of the sentencing Judge as to the relative criminality of those involved and there is no unjustified disparity between the sentence imposed upon the appellant on the one hand, and that imposed upon Yeung on the other.
	
	
	For all of these reasons, these grounds are not made out.
	


Ground 2 – The sentencing judge erred by finding that the appellant and the offender Tran intended to acquire the entire consignment of narcotic available at 138 The Boulevard


	
	This ground mirrored the ground of appeal advanced by the appellant Tran which I have previously discussed. The submissions of the appellant Dang in support of this ground were generally consistent with those advanced on behalf of Tran. However, counsel for Dang relied upon the following additional factors:
	



	
	the telephone intercepts suggested the involvement of others interested in the arrival of the narcotics at Strathfield;
	
	
	the appellant and Tran did not enter the premises at Strathfield;
	
	
	the appellant was a user of narcotics and was found with quantities suggesting personal use rather than commercial dealing;
	



	
	None of these matters affects the conclusion I previously reached. For the reasons previously stated this ground is not made out.
	


GROUND 3 - In all the circumstances the sentence imposed upon the appellant was manifestly excessive, alternatively the head sentence was manifestly excessive

The findings of the sentencing judge


	
	I have previously set out (at [165] above) the findings of the sentencing judge regarding the circumstances of the offending and, in particular, his Honour’s conclusion that both appellants were at the Strathfield premises to take possession of the whole of the consignment. I have also set out (again at [165] above) his Honour’s observations as to the seriousness of the offending.
	
	
	Having dealt with those matters, his Honour said (at ROS 8):
	


“Well know (sic) authorities demonstrate the very substantial role of general deterrence in sentencing offenders for commercially motivated but thankfully thwarted attempts to inject seriously bad drugs into the community. There must be a signal to would-be traffickers that the potential financial gains from doing this will be neutralised by the risk of severe punishment.”


	
	In terms of the appellant’s subjective case his Honour (commencing at ROS 12) noted that the appellant was 35 years of age at the time of the offence, that he was 37 years of age at the date of sentencing, and that he had no relevant criminal history. His Honour concluded that the offending “bespeaks of a flawed character” before dealing with other aspects of his subjective case (commencing at ROS 12):
	


“Mr Dang was born in Vietnam and immigrated to Australia when he was aged 19 years. His schooling in Vietnam took him to midway through high school. However, his command of English is poor as is that of his family.

Prior to going into custody following being convicted by the jury he lived with his mother, wife and three daughters aged 5 years, 3 years and 5 months. His wife currently cares for his 78-year-old mother and children alone. His mother has a heart problem, impaired memory and needs assistance showering and going to the toilet. Since he has gone into custody they have all moved in to reside with his wife's sister.

In Australia he worked as a machine operator in a furniture factory for six to seven years until he lost his right little finger at work. Since then he has had casual jobs, but has mainly looked after his mother. At the time when the jury convicted him of this offence he was receiving a carer's pension.

He told Ms Cullen he commenced smoking heroin at the age of 34 to 35years. He said he would smoke half a gram over a two week period and didnot see it as a problem at the time. He says that since his arrest he hasstopped using heroin and does not want to take it up again. His mother andstepfather brought him up. He told Ms Cullen that his stepfather consumed alcohol and used ""opium every day"". Based on this information Ms Cullen states that his ""exposure to opium and alcohol used by his stepfather is likely to have normalised this behaviour and therefore predisposed him to seeking opiates as a maladaptive coping mechanism"".

Mr Dang also reported a history to Ms Cullen of unresolved abandonmentby his biological father. Although Ms Cullen did not have Mr Dang completeany intelligent test, possibly due to his limited English, my impressions ofMr Dang was that he was not very sharp, far from mature and somewhatimmature. My assessment of his demeanour and observations of him when he gave evidence during the trial, his limited education and the emotional issue with his biological father he has he still wrestles with, cause me to make these findings.

Although Mr Dang has not displayed remorse or contrition I find his prospects of rehabilitation to be reasonable. The fact that he has no prior relevant criminal history, his claim to be drug-abstinent which I accept, his commitment to his family and their support referred to in the report from Ms Cullen cause me to make this finding.

Whilst each offender had a comparatively low level heroin addiction and in Mr Tran's case a gambling problem, resulting no doubt in financial pressures and motive for the crime, each offender's involvement was very much more than simply funding a drug dependency and does not explain it. Nonetheless I have regard to this as part of each subjective case.”

Submissions of the appellant


	
	Counsel for the appellant pointed to a number of factors in support of this ground, including:
	



	
	the fact that the appellant had no criminal history;
	
	
	the appellant ’s age;
	
	
	his background, which included having immigrated to Australia from Vietnam; and
	
	
	the fact that he had the care of his elderly mother as well as three young daughters.
	



	
	Counsel also relied on the observations of Ms Cullen (to which his Honour expressly referred) regarding the appellant’s predisposition to the use of opiates as a result of such use by his stepfather. Counsel for the appellant also relied on the appellant’s lack of maturity as found by the sentencing judge, as well as the fact that he was found to have reasonable prospects of rehabilitation.
	
	
	Whilst acknowledging that the quantity of the drug was a relevant factor, counsel submitted that the quantity in the present case was “well below quantities regularly encountered by investigative authorities and the court”.
	


Submissions of the Crown


	
	The Crown submitted that the appellant had failed to demonstrate any specific error on the part of the sentencing judge. It was submitted that the sentence imposed was within the legitimate exercise of the sentencing discretion, and that the sentencing remarks demonstrated that the sentencing judge had addressed all relevant conclusions.
	


Consideration


	
	In order to succeed on this ground, the appellant must demonstrate that the sentence imposed was unreasonable or plainly unjust: Dinsdale v R [2000] HCA 54; (2000) 202 CLR 321.
	
	
	The submissions advanced on behalf of the appellant tended to focus upon various aspects of his subjective case. The sentencing remarks demonstrate that all of the factors relied upon by counsel for the appellant were taken into account by the sentencing judge. His Honour also had proper regard to the fact that any sentence was required to reflect considerations of general deterrence.
	
	
	His Honour took into account (at ROS 7) the amount of the drug involved. That was a relevant consideration on sentence: Wong v R [2001] HCA 64; (2001) 207 CLR 584 at 609. The consignment contained 822 grams of pure heroin, more than 400 times the marketable quantity. That was, on any view, substantial. The proposition advanced by counsel for the appellant that such quantity was “well below the quantities regularly encountered by investigative authorities and the Court” is so general as to be meaningless. The significance of the quantity is rendered even greater in light of the conclusion that the appellants intended to take possession of the entirety of it.
	
	
	Moreover, his Honour found (at ROS 7) that in committing the offence, both of the appellants were motivated by the profit which would be derived from the sale of the consignment. No challenge was made to that finding. In light of the evidence of the wholesale and street values of the drug (set out at [165] above) the likely profit was substantial.
	
	
	The maximum penalty for the offending was imprisonment for 25 years. In all of the circumstances the sentence imposed was well within the range of proper sentencing discretion. This ground is not made out.
	
	
	ORDERS
	
	
	In respect of the applicant’s leave to appeal against sentence, I propose the following orders in each case:
	


Leave to appeal granted.

Appeal dismissed.

		25 June 2015",2015-06-24 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2703196,R v Weismantel (No 4) [2015] NSWDC 389,"Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: This is an application for leave pursuant to s 132A(1) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. The accused makes an application out of time for trial by Judge alone. Such an application must be made 28 days before the day fixed for the trial in this Court unless the Court otherwise grants leave. If that application be successful, there will follow an application under s 132(4) of the same Act for leave to have the matter tried by a Judge alone as the prosecutor does not consent to the making of an order for trial by Judge alone. It is convenient to deal with both applications at the one time.
	
	
	On 23 September 2014, the accused was committed for trial by the Downing Centre Local Court on a number of charges. Six of those charges arose out of events which occurred on 23 September 2013. The current matter arose out of an event which occurred on 31 December 2013. I shall refer to the current matter as the second trial. The first trial is clearly a reference to the matters alleged against the accused as occurring on 23 September 2013. As far as the first trial is concerned the accused was to be tried with a co-offender, Amanda Faith Ridden.
	
	
	The accused was arraigned in respect of the first trial and in respect of the second trial on 24 October 2014. Two indictments were presented, one applicable to the first trial and one applicable to the second trial. The indictment concerning the first trial contained one count against Amanda Faith Ridden, and it contained six counts against both Ridden and the current accused. The first count was that on 23 September 2013 at Lane Cove the accused whilst in company took for the purposes of driving a motor vehicle, a Nissan Pulsar motor vehicle registered number YTG582, without consent of the owner, Phillip Brighton, whilst Phillip Brighton was in the vehicle. The second count was a count in the alternative to that count. The third and fourth counts allege armed robberies at the Roseville Cinema. The sixth count was of armed robbery at the Revesby Pacific Hotel on 23 September 2013. The final count was a count that whilst in company the accused did intentionally destroy the Nissan Pulsar motor vehicle registered number YTG582, the property of Phillip Brighton.
	
	
	After the arraignment the list judge, Acting Judge Delaney, fixed a six week trial commencing on 15 June 2015. There was a direction that the trial on the current charge, that is the second trial, follow immediately after the conclusion of the first trial. The matter came before the Chief Judge, Price J, on 16 June 2015. I am told and have been told earlier that on that day Ridden pleaded guilty to a number of charges after plea bargaining. The Chief Judge stood the current accused’s trial over to 17 June and on 17 June the matter was stood over for trial on 18 June. The matter was supposed to come before me on that day but I was engaged in a civil hearing until 6pm that day. The matter was due to be before me on Friday 19 June but it was convenient for all concerned that the matter commence on Monday 22 June. On that day, the accused was arraigned on a fresh indictment containing six counts against the accused alone, in respect of the events of 23 September 2013. That day was spent on the hearing of an application for the adducing of coincidence evidence. I ruled that the coincidence evidence be admitted. The matter was then adjourned until 23 June 2015 when I was asked to grant the parties time. Eventually, at 2pm a fresh indictment was presented and the accused was arraigned on four counts and pleaded guilty to each of those four counts. There was one count of taking Mr Brighton’s motor vehicle without his consent, he being in the car and three counts of armed robbery. I was asked to stand the back-up trial, namely, this second trial, until Wednesday 24 June at 10am. At the request of the parties I directed that the accused might be excused on Wednesday 24 June 2015. Mr Schaudin, who appears for the accused, told me that he wished to attend upon the accused at Long Bay Gaol to obtain certain instructions from him. Unfortunately, he could not do so because the accused was brought to court when it was unnecessary that that be done.
	
	
	On 24 June, I was told by the Crown that the present trial could not start until today and that it was then that I was told that Mr Schaudin was attending upon the accused at Long Bay Gaol to obtain instructions. I then stood the matter over for mention today. Mr Schaudin was able to obtain the instructions which he sought from the accused yesterday, Thursday 25 June, and hence the applications made to me today.
	
	
	The present indictment contains one count. That count is this:
	


“On 31 December 2013 at Pennant Hills...while armed with an offensive weapon, namely, a knife did assault Sathaporn Wongsamak with intent to rob him and at the time of the assault he, the said Blake Weismantel, did inflict grievous bodily harm upon him.”


	
	The facts relied upon by the Crown are these, gleaned from exhibit T5. There is situated at 1A Hillcrest Road, Pennant Hills a Thai restaurant. That restaurant is owned by Sathaporn Wongsamak, who is also the chef. There are nine employees including Mr Wongsamak’s wife, Laynookar Wongsamak, to whom I shall refer merely as Mrs Wongsamak. All nine members of the kitchen staff as well as Mr and Mrs Wongsamak were working on New Year’s Eve 2013. At around 10.30 pm, Mr Wongsamak was working in the kitchen and Mrs Wongsamak was working at the counter which is located to the right of the front entrance of the restaurant. Four customers were standing on the footpath outside the restaurant waiting for one of their friends who was still inside the restaurant using the bathroom. The four customers on the footpath had finished their meal and were waiting to be joined by their female friend. At about the same time, Mrs Wongsamak and her sister were sitting behind the front counter where the cash register was located.
	
	
	The accused walked in through the front door of the restaurant and approached the counter. He was holding a knife, 28 centimetres long, in his right hand. He was wearing a black coloured long sleeve woollen jacket with the hood covering his face. He was holding the hood down with his left hand. He was also wearing red, white and blue striped shorts. The accused reached over the counter and pointed the knife towards Mrs Wongsamak waving it around. The blade came very close to Mrs Wongsamak, almost touching her chest and abdomen. At that time the accused said nothing. He walked around the counter near to Mrs Wongsamak and her sister and started hitting the cash register with the knife yelling out, “Empty, empty!” As the accused was yelling he was looking at Mrs Wongsamak. She was shocked, scared and shaking. Mrs Wongsamak called out to her husband for aid. Mr Wongsamak and one of their daughters, and their nephew, and two staff members, ran from the kitchen of the restaurant.
	
	
	Mr Wongsamak yelled out at the accused. He grabbed a wooden chair and held it towards the accused shouting, “Get out”. The accused turned around and walked towards Mr Wongsamak. He pointed the knife towards Mr Wongsamak again making stabbing motions. Mr Wongsamak used the chair to block the accused’s knife. The accused let go of his hood and grabbed another chair, pushing the chair and Mr Wongsamak back about a metre and a half, causing Mr Wongsamak to trip over and fall. He fell onto his left hand side, but in so doing twisted his right leg. Another staff member, Mr Borom, came out of the kitchen, picked up another chair and threw it at the accused. He then picked up a further chair and threw that at the accused. The accused then walked out of the restaurant, turning left, crossed the road, and started walking up Hillcrest Road towards Yarrara Road. A witness used his mobile telephone to take a photograph of the accused as he left. The accused’s red, white and blue striped board shorts can be seen in the photograph.
	
	
	Meanwhile Mr Wongsamak tried to stand up but could not do so because of pain in his right ankle. He remained laying on the floor. One of the customers who was outside the restaurant witnessed the event and called the emergency number. Police and ambulance officers arrived a short time later. A description of the accused was then broadcast. Unsuccessful attempts were made by a police dog to follow the accused. At approximately 10.35pm the accused was seen walking in a southerly direction along Pennant Hills Road, approximately 600 metres from the restaurant. The accused was asked to sit down, which he did. He was searched and police located a mobile phone, a black handled kitchen knife which was removed from the rear waistband of his shorts. The accused was trying to swing his arms around, and was behaving in what is alleged to have been an aggressive manner. At one point he became unconscious. The police called an ambulance. Whilst waiting for the ambulance to arrive the accused regained consciousness and over the next 40 minutes made rude comments to several police officers. On several occasions he moved around and two officers were required to restrain him.
	
	
	According to the police facts the accused remained moderately aggressive and was threatening, and did not respond to attempts to calm him down. At times he was incoherent. While Constable Brylynsky tried to hold the accused, the accused attempted to grab his hands on several occasions. The accused was alleged to yell words to the effect of, “Fuck you, you fucking dog, you like it when I grab you.” The accused was then placed under arrest. He was taken to Hornsby Hospital by ambulance under police escort. The accused also behaved aggressively to hospital staff. He was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit where he was intubated and sedated to manage his aggressive behaviour. On New Year’s Day 2014 he was weaned from the sedation and he became more alert. He remained calm and was reviewed by the psychiatric team at the hospital, and he was re commenced on anti-psychotic medication. On 2 January 2014 he was medically stable, alert, oriented and calm. He was discharged by the hospital into police custody. He was taken to Hornsby police station and charged. He was offered an opportunity to participate in an electronically recorded interview but declined to do so.
	
	
	Mr Wongsamak was conveyed to Hornsby Hospital by ambulance. He presented to the Emergency Department at 11.53pm. The history given by Mr Wongsamak to hospital staff was that whilst he was at work a man with a knife attempted to rob the business, and in the process of that occurring he twisted his ankle in the course of trying to evade the assault. On examination, the right ankle was swollen over the lateral malleolus and the patient was unable to the weight bear. X-rays demonstrated a spiral fracture of the fibula in the ankle. Mr Wongsamak was admitted to the hospital under the care of Dr Ben Gooden, an orthopaedic surgeon.
	
	
	There is before me, as well as a report from the doctor in the Emergency Department, a report from Dr Ben Gooden. He points out that the X-ray not only showed an oblique fracture of the distal fibula, but that oblique fracture extended to the level of the syndesmosis. The X-ray was said to show widening of the ankle mortise in keeping with instability of the ankle joint. Dr Gooden’s report continues thus:
	


“Mr Wongsamak was taken to theatre on 1 January 2014 and underwent an open reduction and internal fixation of the fibula [sic] fracture with a seven hole one third tubular plate and screws. The syndesmosis was found to be unstable on stressing and he therefore had two diastasis screws inserted through the plate. He was kept non-weight bearing for a period of eight weeks post-operatively, and was then mobilised, weight bearing, following this. On 7 March 2014 he returned to the operating theatre to have the diastasis screws removed. This is a standard part of treating this type of fracture.

With regard to the questions that were asked of me from Senior Constable Steven Ireland on 7 July, this particular fracture is a reasonably common one. It does require significant force to lead to fracture of the fibula in association with disruption to the syndesmosis. The metal plate and screws were required to reduce the fracture into an anatomical position and this is standard treatment for this kind of displaced fracture. The patient underwent two procedures, the first being on 1 January 2014 to have the plate and screws inserted, and the second being on 7 March 2014 to have the two diastasis screws removed. It is usual to leave the remaining fibula metalwork in place, this is not routinely removed unless there are overt problems with the metalwork.

The prognosis for this gentleman is good. Most people who suffer these fractures will return to full activities as tolerated over the ensuing three-six months post-operatively. There is an incidence of patients who suffer from ongoing pain and swelling in their ankle after this and there is an incidence of the development of post traumatic arthritis in the long term. Post-operatively, patients require three-six months of physiotherapy to help regain their range of motion and full function of their ankle.”


	
	A statement taken from Mr Wongsamak on 14 September 2015 tells me that he still experiences constant numbness on the lateral malleolus. Prior to the fracture of his right ankle Mr Wongsamak exercised “quite a bit”, including walking on treadmills two or three times weekly. Since the fracture of his ankle Mr Wongsamak is unable to do that and develops pain and soreness in the ankle very quickly when he tries to walk for any long period of time. These ongoing symptoms have affected Mr Wongsamak’s ability to work. He is required, as a chef, to stand and he develops soreness and pain when he stands for long periods of time, which he never experienced before he fractured his ankle. He also notices symptoms when at rest. His ankle might start to ache when he is sitting down, which had never happened before the fracture of his ankle.
	
	
	That there might be post-traumatic arthritis indicates that there was damage to an intra-articular surface and as the ankle is a weight bearing joint it would appear that the onset of post-traumatic arthritis at some time in the future is inevitable. In any event, it appears that Mr Wongsamak has not made a complete recovery from this injury and it appears to me to be unlikely that he will do so, bearing in mind that symptoms have now persisted for some 17 months at least.
	
	
	The accused, by his counsel, tells me that there is no issue as to the identification of the accused at the crime scene. No alibi is raised. No positive defence is raised. In essence, the accused is putting the Crown to proof. That is understandable since the offence alleged against the accused carries a maximum term of imprisonment of 25 years. The accused wants a trial by judge alone. Although the original proceedings were listed for trial for six weeks, the first trial shortened after a week and two days. The Crown was unable to immediately start the second trial which is due to start next Monday.
	
	
	The personal circumstances of the accused must be carefully considered. There is before me a report of a psychiatrist, Dr Richard Furst, who examined the accused, in connection with other proceedings, on 1 December 2012. At that time the accused was 19 years old. He is now 24 years old. He is of Aboriginal descent who was exposed to domestic violence in his early childhood. His father was an alcoholic and his mother was addicted to heroin. His parents were separated when he was about eight years old. He remained in the care of his mother. He came to the attention of the Department of Community Services, as it was then called, about the age of seven. He was deemed to be at risk of physical harm, including sexual harm, because he was not adequately supervised by his parents. It was noted at that time that the accused was behaviourally disturbed. He commenced abusing alcohol at the age of 12 because he mixed with “the wrong crowd”. He was diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder in early childhood but was never treated with stimulant medication for that condition. In his childhood he suffered from mood swings and periods of anger. He also gave a history of depression and of psychotic symptoms that included hearing voices. When received into the Juvenile Justice System he was assessed as being psychotic. He was treated for both with antipsychotic medication and antidepressant medication. He was considered a risk to himself. He has been experiencing for some considerable time now hallucinations, auditory as well as visual. He also suffers from paranoia and as at 1 February 2012 had been having paranoid delusions for three years. He started abusing the sedative drug Valium at the age of 14 years and cannabis at the same time. He soonstarted using amphetamines and crystal methylamphetamine, or “ice”. By the age of 15 or 16 he was injecting heroin once or twice every fortnight. He also used Ecstasy at times, LSD and “Magic Mushrooms”.
	
	
	He was diagnosed by Dr Furst as suffering from paranoid schizophrenia and substance abuse. Dr Furst also found evidence of personality dysfunction. Dr Furst said this about schizophrenia:
	


“Schizophrenia is a chronic psychotic illness often characterised by delusional beliefs, auditory hallucinations, disorder of thought form, difficulty processing information, nerve instability and bizarre behaviour as a consequence of the illness. There is often a prodromal period in which individuals with the illness feel lethargic, depressed and unable to cope, resulting in disruption to family relationships and poor social functioning. Frequent symptoms include paranoid beliefs, self-referential thinking, grandiose delusions and thought disorder.

Schizophrenia is thought to be biologically driven because of abnormalities in dopamine transmission, differences seen in brain volume and genetic transmission. It usually runs a chronic course requiring hospitalisation during acute episodes and the need for longer-term treatment with antipsychotic medications (tablets or injections), as have been required for Mr Weismantel in the past.”

As to the prognosis Dr Furst expressed the view that the accused was likely to continue to display psychotic symptoms of a residual type which was typical of the type of the illness from which he was suffering.


	
	An ambulance officer requested an assessment of the accused at the time that the accused was with the police immediately after his arrest on Pennant Hills Road. The ambulance officer who was authorised to exercise functions under the Mental Health Act 2007 informed an authorised medical officer of the Hornsby Hospital that the accused was mentally ill or mentally disturbed. He provided these details:
	


“Patient demonstrating psychotic behaviour. Patient unclear of situation. Patient making sexual advances to officers in response to assessment. Patient threatening violence towards officers and officers’ families. Patient agitated and fighting restraint. Patient not responding to questions or communicating appropriately.”

Hence the accused was conveyed to the Hornsby Hospital and admitted under the provisions of the Mental Health Act 2007 prior to his being discharged from that institution and taken into police custody. It is clear that immediately after the offence now alleged the accused was suffering from psychotic symptoms. I have been told from the Bar table, without objection, that the accused remains on antipsychotic medication to the current time.


	
	If the matter be tried with a jury I am told that the Crown will need to call between 10 and 15 witnesses to give oral evidence, as well, no doubt, as Dr Gooden to give evidence to the jury about the extent of the injury sustained by Mr Wongsamak. I am told by Mr Schaudin from the Bar table, again without objection, that should the matter be tried by judge alone the trial can be conducted with most of the statements of witnesses, with suitable redaction, being tendered into evidence without any of those witnesses having to give sworn evidence from the witness box. In other words, there does not appear to be any issue of credit which might best be left to a jury. There is no factual issue that requires the application of objective community standards including any issue of reasonableness, any issue of negligence or any issue, for example, of indecency, obscenity or dangerousness. There is not, as here, any issue relating to intention that might best be determined by a jury as arose in R v King [2013] NSWSC 448 or any issue that raises any substantive issue of the credibility or reliability of any witness as arose in R v Dean [2013] NSWSC 661.
	
	
	However, there is the issue of the accused’s mental state and his ability to give attention to a lengthy trial. I sought some assurances from learned counsel for the accused and was given them. When I asked the learned Crown Prosecutor whether it was necessary for Mr Schaudin to call his solicitor to give oral evidence about those matters from the witness box, I was told that was not necessary.
	
	
	The early part of the first trial was taken up, as far as the accused was concerned, with concentrating on the issues raised in the first trial and giving attention to the six counts which he then faced. In essence, a count in the alternative was dropped by the Crown and the Crown did not proceed with the final count, the count of intentionally destroying Mr Brighton’s Nissan Pulsar motor car by means of a fire. The accused was prepared to plead guilty to charges carrying 25 years’ imprisonment, but was not prepared to plead guilty to a charge which carried a maximum term of 11 years’ imprisonment. Mr Schaudin assures me that because of the accused’s mental condition, he concentrated only on the issues relating to the first trial and did not raise with the accused any issues relating to the second trial until, in essence, the first trial was disposed of. It was then that the accused gave his counsel instructions to apply for trial by Judge alone.
	
	
	I have now seen Mr Weismantel in the dock for the whole of Monday, 22 June, and the afternoon of 23 June. I have seen him again in the dock this morning. At about 11.30 he asked to be excused from being in the dock, he preferred to be downstairs in a cell. He could not be taken from the Courthouse prior to the usual closing hour of 4pm in any event. Today he appears not attired for a trial, but in prison greens and he looked somewhat dishevelled, although he had not looked dishevelled last Monday. From what I was told from the Bar table, he appeared to be somewhat fatalistic about what might happen to him and oblivious to how he ought to be dressed when appearing before the Court. I am confident that a lengthy trial involving the calling of 10 to 15 witnesses would be very taxing on Mr Weismantel’s ability to concentrate, and I am concerned that he might not present towards a jury favourably after a number of days of hearing.
	
	
	One can understand the accused putting the Crown to proof of the matters contained in the second indictment because one might readily accept that, bearing in mind what was observed by police and ambulance officers immediately after the crime alleged in the current indictment, that he might not have any independent recollection of what he had done and therefore he puts the Crown to proof.
	
	
	When I enquired of the learned Crown prosecutor what would be achieved by a trial by jury, as distinct from a trial by Judge alone, the learned Crown prosecutor told me that the question of whether the harm inflicted upon the victim, Mr Wongsamak, was grievous bodily harm, distinct from actual bodily harm, was quintessentially a matter for a jury. I have only had in 11 years, one jury trial where such an issue was left to a jury as the sole issue in the case. There was a fracture of a bone, but no residual symptomatology. Quite frankly, I have been dealing with medico-legal issues as a Judge now for 21 years next month and am acutely aware of what might constitute grievous bodily harm as distinct from actual bodily harm and I have no hesitation in believing that a judge with some experience in the field can adequately determine that matter as well as any jury can or ought or would.
	
	
	The purpose of s 132A is to prevent the practice known as “forum shopping”. Not only is it to prevent that practice, it is to prevent the appearance of that practice. When I asked the learned Crown prosecutor whether it would be appropriate, to avoid the appearance of forum shopping, if I made the decision that the matter be tried by Judge alone, that it be heard by another Judge, the learned Crown prosecutor told me that if I made such an order there would be no application by the Crown that someone other than me should hear the Judge alone trial. In other words, the Crown accepts that this is not an actual exercise in “forum shopping”. The only ruling I have made thus far was against the accused, when I determined that coincidence evidence should be admitted in the first trial.
	
	
	Bearing in mind the difficulties which I accept that the defence has had in obtaining instructions from the accused, I accept that it was imprudent to seek instructions from the accused to have a trial by judge alone in the second trial, whilst the issues concerning the first trial were still extant. In the circumstances, I believe that I should exercise my discretion under s 132A(1) and grant leave to the accused to make an application for an order under s 132 less than 28 days before the date fixed for hearing.
	
	
	That issue raised a nice point as to whether the time for making the application ran from the date when the first trial was set to commence or ran backwards from the date when the second trial should have commenced had the first trial proceeded. However, that I need not decide.
	
	
	The issue then becomes whether it be in the interests of justice that the current matter be heard by a Judge sitting alone. I have carefully read what fell from the McClellan CJ at CL in R v Belghar [2012] NSWCCA 86 and also what fell from Hidden J, particularly at [118] and also the decision of Bellew J in R v King and the decision of Latham J in R v Dean. It is clear that the fact that an accused has made an application for trial by judge alone is relevant, but not determinative. It is also clear on the case law that there is no presumption that trial should be with a jury, thereby casting a burden of proof on the accused. The accused carries an evidentiary onus but the Court does not need to determine where the interests of justice lie by requiring the evidence to rise to a level by which a “presumption” of trial by jury is displaced. Each mode of trial has its particular characteristics and accordingly, depending on all the circumstances relating to a particular case, the Court may conclude that the interests of justice are best served by a trial by judge alone.
	
	
	There is no compelling reason in the current matter for trial by jury. There is a compelling reason, based on the accused’s mental health, that the trial be short. Accordingly, I believe it is in the interests of justice, not merely because of the interests of the accused personally, but because it is in the interest of our community that persons with a mental illness have a form of trial that meets the requirements of their medical condition, that meets the requirements of their ability to concentrate, and for a person such as the present accused, who may not recollect why or in what circumstances or how the offence was committed, that there be a reasoned explanation of why he might be guilty of the criminal offence, or, indeed, why he might not be guilty of the offence alleged against him. I have formed the view that it certainly is in the interests of justice that there be trial by Judge alone. I so order.

2703206,R v Prendergast [2015] NSWDC 216,"Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: Fitu Prendergast stands for sentence as a consequence of criminal activity in which he was involved on Friday 23 March 2013. As a consequence of the offender’s involvement in that activity he was arrested on 19 August 2013 and has been in custody ever since.
	
	
	The facts of the matter are gravely disturbing. The offender was born on 22 April 1988. At the time he was 24 years old. He is a well-built man of Samoan origin. The victims of the offences in which the offender was involved are Mr Michael Boumelhem, who at the time was 67 years old, and his wife, Elaine, was then 59 years old. Mr and Mrs Boumelhem have seven children. At the time the offences now in question, two of those children were living at home: a son, Chris, who was then 26, and a daughter, Mary, who was then 24. At the time of the offences now in question, Mary was out, I assume, on a social occasion.
	
	
	Mr and Mrs Boumelhem and their two children were living at Ada Street Concord. Their house is a double storey brick residence located on the corner of Ada Street and Melbourne Street. The house is a large one. Upstairs there are five separate bedrooms and on the ground floor there are three lounges, a bathroom, kitchen and laundry. There are two entrances, one from Ada Street and another from Melbourne Street.
	
	
	On the evening of Friday 22 March 2013 both Mr and Mrs Boumelhem were downstairs watching television. Chris was upstairs in his bedroom, either watching television or sleeping, and certainly at a later time, sleeping. At 10pm Mr and Mrs Boumelhem retired to their rooms for the evening.
	
	
	At 12.20am on Saturday 23 March Mrs Boumelhem arose from her bed and walked downstairs in order to use the bathroom and to obtain a drink of water. When she got out of bed she noticed that the house was extremely dark: the usual hallway lights were not turned on. She attempted to switch a light on in the hallway but it would not turn on. It appears that she had thought the globe had blown.
	
	
	At the time that Mrs Boumelhem was attempting to leave her room and go downstairs to the lower bathroom the offender and four other unknown persons were walking towards the front door which is that facing Melbourne Street. As Mrs Boumelhem walked to the bottom of the staircase she noticed some shadows through the glass panels of the front door. She thought it was her daughter, Mary, returning home after her night out. Mrs Boumelhem proceed to the bathroom. She attempted to turn on the light but it did not work. She appears to have thought that there may have been a blackout.
	
	
	One of the offenders smashed the front glass panel of the front door. Mrs Boumelhem heard the sound of the glass smashing. She, again, thought it was her daughter who may have dropped something. Mrs Boumelhem yelled out to her daughter asking her daughter whether she was all right but there was no reply. After smashing the glass panel of the front door the offender and four other unknown persons entered the premises. By that time Mrs Boumelhem had finished in the bathroom and looked out into the foyer. She saw five unknown persons running inside the house. They were dressed in black clothing and all wore black balaclavas. Mrs Boumelhem saw three of the intruders run directly upstairs whilst the other two ran towards the ground floor hallway.
	
	
	Mrs Boumelhem feared for her safety. She locked herself in the bathroom and began to scream. She cried out for her husband and her son and her daughter. She continued screaming. She heard her husband call out her name but did not hear anything after that. Within seconds of her locking herself in her bathroom Mrs Boumelhem heard loud banging noises on the bathroom door. The bathroom door was broken open and she was pushed back into the bathroom with her side striking the washbasin. She was grabbed around the neck by a person unknown to her, a man, and held in a position akin to a headlock. Her mouth was covered by one of the hands of this intruder. The intruder was wearing thin gloves. Thin gloves were found by police when they established a crime scene on the ground near the front entrance door of the house. DNA evidence tells me that on one of the swabs taken from the glove contains the DNA of both the offender and Mrs Boumelhem. The only inference to be drawn is that it was this offender who confronted Mrs Boumelhem and put her into a headlock.
	
	
	Mrs Boumelhem was then dragged out to the hallway where she continued to be held in a headlock and was repeatedly told to shut up. Her mouth continued to be covered by the offender’s hand. A short time later Mrs Boumelhem saw the three offenders who had gone upstairs running back down the stairs. Again she noticed they were wearing black balaclavas. The offender removed his hand from Mrs Boumelhem’s mouth and pushed her against the wall in the hallway causing her to hit the back of her head and her right shoulder against the wall. All the offenders then ran out of the house and away down the street.
	
	
	In the meantime Mr Boumelhem was awoken by his wife’s cries for help, by her screams. He got up and proceeded to walk towards the staircase. About two metres from the top of the staircase Mr Boumelhem was violently assaulted by one or more intruders, causing him to lose consciousness for some time. He had been struck over the head and sustained very severe injuries. It is unknown whether any weapon was involved in the attack on him. When he recovered consciousness, Mr Boumelhem went down the stairs to his wife. She was sitting on the floor of the hallway with her back against the wall, still screaming. Mr Boumelhem obviously did not know what had happened, either to his wife or to him. He said to his wife, “Why are you screaming? There is nothing wrong. All the neighbours will wake up.”
	
	
	It is clear that Mrs Boumelhem must have been hysterical by this stage. She insisted that the police be called. By this stage Chris Boumelhem had been awoken by his mother’s screams for help. He walked down the stairs to the ground floor. His attempt to turn on the lights was also unsuccessful. His mother told him that she thought the power had been cut off. Mr Boumelhem Junior observed that the front door was open and his mother told him that someone had broken in. Mr Boumelhem Junior used his mobile phone to contact the emergency number and request the assistance of the police.
	
	
	A short time after that Mr Boumelhem junior saw that his father’s white singlet was covered in blood. He had blood on one of his arms. He used the light on his mobile phone to illuminate his father. He could see blood coming from his head and down his face. He then used his mobile phone again to request an ambulance. Police and ambulance arrived shortly afterwards.
	
	
	Mr and Mrs Boumelhem were treated ambulance officers and taken by the ambulance to Concord Hospital. Mr Boumelhem’s injuries were so serious that he needed to be transferred to the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital where he was placed in intensive care.
	
	
	At the victims’ home police observed the fuse box had been entered and all the fuses turned off. The police also observed blood drops on the internal side of the timber front door below the smashed glass panel as well as drops of blood on the stairs leading out to the front entrance door and on the outside porch, as well as observing a glove to which I have already referred. The DNA matched that of the offender and hence his arrest.
	
	
	As a result of being pushed against the wall by the offender Elaine Boumelhem suffered bruising and in particular a fracture of her right scapula. She needed to wear her right arm in a sling until she recovered from that fracture. She was placed on pain killing medication. Mr Boumelhem was diagnosed with a fractured skull and bleeding on the brain. He also had multiple fractures including two fractured orbital bones, a fracture of his nasal bone and a fracture of his coccyx. He suffered a ten centimetre laceration to the left forehead which required repair during surgery: 25 stitches were inserted to close the laceration.
	
	
	This is a home invasion by a group of five men dressed in black, disguised in balaclavas, obviously intent on theft.
	
	
	The offender was interviewed by Ms Erin Kirkwood of Community Corrections on 18 June 2015. Under the heading “Attitude to Offending” the following is recorded:
	


“The Court is advised that Mr Prendergast was somewhat vague in his recollection of the events and required prompting on a number of occasions. Mr Prendergast confirmed that there was a level of premeditation to the offences, advising that the victims’ residence had been targeted. He advised that the residence appeared to be one which was likely to contain a significant amount of money or goods, due to its external appearance. He denied any personal knowledge of the victims and portrayed the offence and selection of residence as ‘random’. The offender advised that he entered the premises after the electricity had been turned off, advising that this occurred as a result of the belief that there was an alarm system installed at the premises. He recalled that he and his co-offenders entered the premises and claimed he was unaware that the victims were home.

He alleged that upon learning that the victims were at home, he attempted to leave the premises. He further claimed that he was not involved in the assault upon either victim at the location.

Despite prompting, the offender experienced difficulty in terms of verbalising the impact of the offences upon the victims. Mr Prendergast failed to express empathy for the victims, aside from stating that he thought they were not home. The offender also failed to verbalise or relate to the likely impact upon the victims and the long lasting effects of his offending upon them. The offender also advised that he is unaware of the severity of the injuries that the victims incurred, until arrested for the offences.”


	
	Despite the offender’s assertion that he was not involved in an assault of either victim I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he was the offender who assaulted Mrs Boumelhem. I am also not persuaded that he did not know that they were not at home. It is clear from the agreed facts that lights had been left on in the hallway. It is also clear that there was a belief that an alarm system was installed and that is confirmed by Mr Boumelhem’s victim impact statement. There were lights on that would indicate to anybody that someone was at home. Furthermore, this happened shortly after midnight on a Saturday morning when most residences in this city and in this nation are occupied. I cannot accept the offender did not know there was no one at home. However I do accept there was no personal malice involved in selecting the Boumelhem’s house for this home invasion. Their house was selected because it looked opulent and his victims were thought to be wealthy.
	
	
	What I have just quoted also indicates that the offender at the time he was interviewed by Community Corrections had little insight into his offending behaviour. The victims’ daughter, Mary, read the victim impact statements in open court. I observed closely the offender, who hung his head in shame when they were being read. I hope that he now realises the effect of what he was involved in and the effect it has had on the victims. Mr and Mrs Boumelhem had seven children together and have 14 grandchildren. They were senior citizens in a private residence in a tranquil suburb.
	
	
	The inference to be drawn from this criminal behaviour and similar behaviour which this Court commonly sees is that the other offenders were also probably male and also probably known to each other. They were out to get goods and/or money to sell the goods to obtain further money, perhaps, like Mr Prendergast, to support their illegal drug habits.
	
	
	This case is clearly in the midrange of objective seriousness for an offence contrary to s112(2) of the Crimes Act 1900. The offence carries a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment. There is a standard non-parole period of five years. The offender has pleaded guilty to two offences contrary to s112(2) because there were two victims of this home invasion, Mr Michael Boumelhem and his wife Elaine Boumelhem.
	
	
	There are a number of aggravating factors. For the purposes of s112(2) the circumstances of aggravation are set out in s105A(1). They are these:
	


(a)   the alleged offender is armed with an offensive weapon, or instrument;

(b)   the alleged offender is in the company of another person or persons;

(c)   the alleged offender uses corporal violence on any person;

(d)   the alleged offender intentionally or recklessly inflicts actual bodily harm on any person;

(e)   the alleged offender deprives any person of his or her liberty;

(f)   the alleged offender knows that there is a person, or that there are persons, in the place where the offence is alleged to be committed.

Under subs (3) of the same provision the definitions contained in subs (1) are not mutually exclusive. The circumstance of aggravation pleaded in the indictment is that the offender was in company. I can take other circumstances of aggravation into account as aggravating factors.


	
	The first aggravating factor provided by s21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1990 is the offender has a previous record for offences of violence. I shall refer to that record later.
	
	
	The next aggravating factor is the fact that not only was the offender in company which is an element of the offence but also because he is in the company not of one other but four others. The nature of this factor was considered in R v Way (2013) 60 NSWLR 168. It was said that the nature and extent of the company and the behaviour of the persons in company with the offender can be taken to account in assessing the objective seriousness of the offence (at [107]). Similarly in Ngati v R [2008] NSWCCA 3 the sentencing judge found it was an aggravating factor that the offender was in company with three other persons as distinct from one. It was an element of this offence that it was committed in company. An aggravating feature was constituted by the number of offenders which exceeded the number necessary to constitute the element of “in company”.
	
	
	Here there was the aggravating factor that the offence was committed in the home of the victims. In Palijan v R [2010] NSWCCA it was held that an offence under s112(2) of the Crimes Act does not require that the premises broken into be the dwelling house of the victim. Here the offender with others broke into the dwelling house of Mr and Mrs Boumelhem. That is an aggravating factor.
	
	
	Another aggravating factor is that provided by par (g) of the subsection which allows me to consider that the injury, emotional harm, loss or damage caused by the offence was substantial. Here the injuries suffered by each of the victims was not only actual bodily harm which need not be anything greater than a scratch or a bruise or an abrasion but was much greater. Mrs Boumelhem suffered a fracture of her scapula, her shoulder blade, and the injuries to Mr Boumelhem were not only extremely serious but life-threatening. It is important to bear in mind what fell from Sully J in R v Bolter [2002] NSWCCA 435. At [11] his Honour said:
	


“Many people, and especially people who are of comparatively senior years, are affected, and badly affected, by break, enter and steal offences in ways which are not quantifiable in dollars and cents. What ought to be the sanctity and sanctuary of their homes is violated. Their own sense of security, a right it might be noted and not a privilege, is traduced; any sense of confidence that they can be peacefully, going about their lawful affairs without the gratuitous interference of other people is dealt a very severe blow.”

The victim impact statements which have been read certainly speak of not only physical injuries but the emotional harm to which Sully J referred.


	
	Pursuant to par (m) of the subsection it is an aggravating factor that the offences were planned. Clearly it was necessary to round up a band of five men, to have them all dress in black, to wear balaclavas, to decide which house to attempt to break into and steal from, to realise that there might be an alarm system and to turn off the electricity in order to commit the offence. These to suggest that this was a pre-planned criminal activity.
	
	
	I also must take into account the non-charged aggravating factors. Corporal violence was used on Mrs Boumelhem and on Mr Boumelhem. It has been submitted that the offender knew that there was a person or persons present in that house and that constituted an aggravating factor. Whilst I do not accept that the offender did not know that there were persons in the house I cannot find beyond reasonable doubt that he did actually know that there were persons in the house although it appears to me to be more probable than not. However the aggravating factors must be proved beyond reasonable doubt.
	
	
	The offender has a poor criminal history. He committed a number of offences on 1 March 2005. He was then almost 15 years old. He committed the offence of affray and two offences of assaulting a police officer in the execution of the officer’s duty. The Children’s Court imposed bonds to be of good behaviour. On 19 August 2009 the offender was sentenced by this Court sitting at Campbelltown for an offence of aggravated robbery with wounding. This Court imposed a three year prison term and fixed a non-parole period of 15 months. On 26 December 2012 the offender assaulted his sister occasioning actual bodily harm to her. He was sentenced on 30 July 2013 by the Local Court at Campbelltown to an intensive correction order for a period of 12 months. The offender has a number of other offences, relatively minor: destroying or damaging property, obtaining money by deception and driving whilst suspended. For those offences he was fined. The offender clearly has a history of criminal violence. Indeed he has committed acts of violence whilst in custody. During his second period of imprisonment he committed offences of intimidation and fighting. During his most recent period of incarceration he committed a fight or other combat offence on 31 May 2014 and assaults on 23 September 2014.
	
	
	I turn to the other matters which I must consider, the personal circumstances of the offender. Mr Prendergast is Samoan. He cannot remember his last contact with his father. He came to Australia with his mother and siblings when he was nine years old. He and his family obtained Australian citizenship in about 2006. He completed year 12 and attempted a number of TAFE courses. He did obtain a certificate in construction. Such work as he had done is essentially general labouring work but he has not been consistently employed.
	
	
	The offender appears to have a problem with alcohol and he was under the influence of alcohol at the time he assaulted his sister. He has been using methylamphetamine since 2012 and had been using at the time of this offence. It is clear that the offender was motivated to commit crimes because of a need to obtain money or goods to support his drug habit and, because of unemployment at various times, to obtain money. Community Corrections tell me that the offender needs referral for drug and alcohol related interventions, anger management, violence management and needs to improve his educational skills and his ability to obtain employment.
	
	
	The offender told Ms Kirkwood that he also had a number of pre-existing injuries to his shoulder, wrist and knees as a result of his recreational sporting activities. Being Samoan it could be well be rugby or rugby league.
	
	
	These are very serious offences. Parliament has prescribed a 20 year maximum penalty. I note with some trepidation that it appears from statistics kept by the Judicial Commission since October 2007 that the highest sentence imposed for an offence contrary to s 112(2) is six years imprisonment. However here there are two offences. They cannot be dealt with wholly concurrently because there are two different victims. The injuries sustained by Mr Boumelhem are particularly severe. The psychie damage to both Mr and Mrs Boumelhem is well within the range of what one would expect of crimes of this nature for which our community cries out for protection from the Courts, as it does from the police.
	
	
	This is a matter which in my view warrants the imposition of an aggregate sentence. I have come to the view that I should start the sentencing exercise with a sentence of eight years imprisonment. That is to be reduced by 10% because of the accused’s plea of guilty on the morning of his trial. The discount for the plea of guilty is for its utilitarian value. The evidence against the offender was strong, but at least he saved Mr and Mrs Boumelhem the trauma of having to relive their experiences by giving evidence from the witness box in front of a jury.
	
	
	It also has the utilitarian value of, for example, repeated trials should it be necessary for one reason or another to discharge a jury and start the trial again.I round 9.6 months off to 10 months. That leaves me with 86 months or seven years and two months.
	
	
	The non-parole period prescribed by Parliament would result in a non-parole period of 64 and a half months, which I round off to be 64 months, which is five years and four months. There are a few reasons but not particularly cogent ones to warrant the breaking of the statutory ratio between the head sentence and the non-parole period. I have come to the view that I should impose a non-parole period of five years. The special circumstances are that the offender, who is now 27 years, will not be eligible for release for parole until 19 August 2018 which is a further period of incarceration of three years. By that time he will have gained greater maturity and perhaps got out the habit of stimulant use. He has to have something in order to encourage him to re-enter the community as a law abiding man, prepared to work to support himself and to look, for example, for a girlfriend or wife, to settle down and have a family if that is what he is motivated to do. That is it might help towards his rehabilitation: whilst things do not look good at this stage in that regard, time may cause the picture to change.
	
	
	I should indicate and do indicate that had I dealt with each offence separately, I would have imposed a head sentence of five years and ten months in each case, starting with a head sentence of six years and six months and reducing that by 10% which I would round up to eight months, reducing it to five years and ten months.
	
	
	Everything all right with you Mr Harrison?
	


HARRISON: Yes thank you your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: The term commencing on 19 August 13, the non-parole period, will expire on 18 August 2018, is that right?

HIGGINS: Correct your Honour.

HARRISON: Yes your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: The balance of the term is two years and two months. When does that finish, 18 October 2020?

HIGGINS: Yes your Honour.

HARRISON: Yes.


	
	Fitu Prendergast, on the charge that on 23 March 2013 at Concord in this State you did break and enter into the dwelling house of Michael and Elaine Boumelhem situated at 11 Ada Street and commit a serious indictable offence, therein namely occasion actual bodily harm to Michael Boumelhem in circumstances of aggravation, namely that you were in company with persons unknown, you are convicted.
	
	
	On the charge that on 23 March 2013 at Concord in this State you did break and enter into the dwelling house of Michael and Elaine Boumelhem situated at 11 Ada Street and commit a serious indictable offence, therein namely occasion actual bodily harm to Elaine Boumelhem in circumstances of aggravation, namely that you were in company of persons unknown, you are convicted.
	
	
	I sentence you to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of five years commencing on 19 August 2013 and expiring on 18 August 2018. I impose a further period of imprisonment of two years and two months to commence upon the expiration of the non-parole period and expiring on 18 October 2020. The total sentence is therefore seven years and two months comprising the non-parole period, the balance of the sentence. I have found special circumstances. You are eligible to be considered for release to parole at the expiration of the non-parole period.
	
	
	Any other orders sought?
	


HIGGINS: No your Honour.

	LEEMING JA: I agree with Hamill J.
	
	
	SIMPSON JA: I agree with Hamill J.
	
	
	HAMILL J: The applicants seek leave to appeal against sentences imposed upon them by his Honour Judge King SC DCJ in the District Court sitting in Parkes on Friday, 16 May 2014.
	
	
	Each applicant was charged with two offences that can generally be described as arson although they were charged under different provisions of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). Ms Ruge was charged under s 197(1)(b) of the Crimes Act, an offence carrying a maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment. The elements of that offence include that the act was done “dishonestly, with a view to making a gain”. Mr Cormack was charged under s 195(1A)(b) carrying a maximum penalty of 11 years. That offence does not involve an allegation that he was motivated to obtain a gain. The difference between the charges is of some significance in view of his submissions on this application.
	
	
	In general terms, the allegation was that Ms Ruge was the owner of a car, and certain chattels located inside a residential property that she was renting. Both the car and the property within the premises were insured with the NRMA. She arranged for another man (Jack Buckman) to set fire to the property and her car with a view to making claims on her insurance policy. Ms Ruge was not present when the fires were set. However, Mr Cormack was present when Mr Buckman set both of the fires. Mr Cormack played no part in the setting of the fires and his criminal liability arose from the application of principles of joint criminal enterprise. He was present, with knowledge that the crimes were being committed, ready, willing and able to assist. However, the evidence showed that he did nothing himself to advance the enterprise.
	
	
	The sentence proceedings took place on Wednesday, 14 May 2014. The proceedings initially involved all three offenders. At the conclusion of the evidence and submissions on 15 May 2014, Mr Buckman sought an adjournment to enable further evidence to be obtained. The proceedings were then separated and the present applicants were sentenced the following day, Friday, 16 May 2014.
	
	
	King DCJ imposed aggregate sentences pursuant to s 53 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) (“Sentencing Act”). No complaint is made in relation to the manner in which his Honour dealt with that provision. In accordance with the section, King DCJ indicated the individual sentences he would have imposed for each count and then imposed the following aggregate sentences:
	


Ruge - a non-parole period of two years and six months to commence on 15 May 2014 and to expire on 14 November 2016 with a balance of term of one year. The total aggregate sentence was one of three years and six months.

Cormack - a non-parole period of one year and ten months to commence on 21 April 2014 and to expire on 20 February 2016. There was a balance of term of nine months. The total sentence was two years and seven months and, in accordance with s 50 of the Sentencing Act, he is to be released on 20 February 2016.


	
	Ms Ruge relies on the following grounds of appeal:
	



	
	The sentencing Judge erred in taking into account irrelevant considerations regarding the potential for a fire to spread and the risk to others.
	
	
	The sentencing Judge erred in failing to make a finding of the existence of special circumstances and adjusting the ratio of the non-parole period to the head sentence to a greater extent than he did.
	
	
	The aggregate sentence imposed was manifestly excessive.
	



	
	Mr Cormack notified four grounds of appeal but was given leave to rely on a similar ground to Ms Ruge’s first ground. In the result his grounds of appeal are as follows:
	



	
	The learned sentencing Judge contravened the principle in R v De Simoni (1981) 147 CLR 383 by sentencing the applicant on the basis of that he believed his co-offenders would financially benefit from their crimes by way of a fraudulent insurance claim.
	
	
	The learned sentencing Judge erred in finding that the applicant’s role was “substantial”.
	
	
	The sentence imposed on the applicant was manifestly excessive.
	
	
	The applicant has a justifiable sense of grievance arising out of the disparity between the sentence he received and those imposed on his co-offenders.
	
	
	The sentencing Judge erred in taking into account irrelevant considerations regarding the potential for a fire to spread and the risk to others.
	



	
	Each of the applicants referred to the sentence imposed on Mr Buckman on 10 October 2014 in support of aspects of their appeal grounds. King DCJ sentenced Mr Buckman on 10 October 2014 in relation to two offences under s 197 (that is, the same offences in relation to which Ms Ruge was sentenced). A total sentence of three years and six months was imposed. His Honour made a finding of special circumstances under s 44 of the Sentencing Act and imposed a non-parole period of two years.
	


FACTS OF THE OFFENCES


	
	The facts found by King DCJ, based on an agreed statement of facts tendered in each case, were as follows:
	


“1.   The premises located at 143 York Street, Forbes, was a single storey detached house owned by Mr Michael James of Tamworth. The house was rented through Ray White Real Estate Agency at Forbes to Rebecca Ruge. At the time of the fire, Ruge lived alone at the house as her partner and son had moved out sometime before. Ruge was also the owner of motor vehicle registered number BL98QF, which was a 2005 blue Holden Commodore sedan. Both the vehicle and the contents of the house were insured at the time by NRMA Insurance.

2.   Around the time of the offences, Ruge was spending her time partying with a social group in Forbes who drank and took drugs together.

3.   Between Christmas and New Year 2012, Ruge had a conversation with Jack Buckman, a member of her social group, in which they agreed that Buckman would burn out her house and her car, and that she would make insurance claims after that had occurred.

4.   Ruge agreed to pay Buckman not less than $6,000 of the insurance money in return for him lighting the fires.

5.   Ruge later removed a number of valuables (laptop, camera, video camera) and personal items (papers, photos, resume, achievement certificates etcetera) from her house.

6.   On 3 January 2013, Buckman was at a house in Cedar Crescent at Forbes. During the afternoon, Ruge came to the house and gave Buckman the keys to the house and car and said to him ""Do it tonight, I'm going to Orange"".

7.   Later that evening, Buckman, in company with two friends named Alex Cormack and Walter Dalton, walked to Ruge's premises in York Street, Forbes. Using the keys, Buckman got into Ruge's vehicle, which was then parked outside the house. Cormack and Dalton also got into the vehicle. Buckman then drove the vehicle to his mother's house and borrowed $10 from his mother, intending to purchase fuel. He then drove to a BP service station in Darling Street, Forbes. CCTV footage shows Buckman entering the service station at about 10.52pm and purchasing a Repco brand 5-litre tin petrol container. He then went to a petrol bowser and filled the container with $5 (3.44 litres) of unleaded petrol. While he did that, the other two males remained in the vehicle.

8.   Buckman then drove back to Ruge's premises where he got out of the vehicle carrying the container of fuel. Cormack and Dalton remained in the vehicle. Using the keys, Buckman entered the house. He then splashed petrol about the house, including in a bedroom, the hallway and the kitchen. He then set the house alight using a lighter. In the process, the petrol container caught fire and Buckman suffered some minor burns. He then ran out of the house and re-entered the vehicle, sat in the driver's seat and then drove off with Cormack and Dalton still in the car.

9.   Buckman, still in the company of Cormack and Dalton, then drove to Parkes. He stopped the vehicle at one point and stole a length of garden hose. He then drove the vehicle to a bushland area about twenty metres west of Back Yamma Road. He put one end of the hose into the vehicle's petrol tank and the other end into the backseat area of the vehicle. He then syphoned petrol from the tank to the backseat and set the vehicle alight using a cigarette lighter. The three men then left the area together on foot.

10.   Shortly after 11 pm that night, a neighbour contacted Triple-0 to report a fire at 143 York Street, Forbes. New South Wales Fire Brigade units from both Parkes and Forbes attended with police at 11.12pm. The fire was extinguished by 12.04am. The house was vacant and no one was injured by the fire. Police were told that Ruge had left the house about 6.30pm that day to travel to Orange with her former partner and their child. The structure remained standing, although the interior of the house and the roof cavity were extensively damaged along with the furniture inside the house. It is not included in the facts but I have been informed from the bar table without disagreement that the house was subsequently demolished.

11.   An inspection was conducted by New South Wales Fire Brigade personnel. It was immediately obvious to them that the fire was suspicious, as there were several ignition points inside the premises, and accelerant pour patterns were obvious in one of the bedrooms. The metal fuel tin was located in the hallway.

12.   The vehicle owned by Ruge had been taken from where it would normally be parked on the front lawn of the house.

13.   While police were still attending at the house fire, Parkes police responded to a motor vehicle fire in scrub just off Back Yamma Road, Parkes. The fire was reported at 12.01am and extinguished by the Parkes Fire Brigade at about 12.40am. The vehicle was identified as that owned by Ruge and had been totally destroyed by fire.

14.   When attending the scene of the house fire, police were given the names of three suspects by onlookers. They received information that three persons Cormack, Buckman and Dalton, were driving around in Ruge's vehicle shortly before the fire started, and that Buckman had apparently borrowed money from his mother to purchase fuel in order to light the fire at the house.

15.   The offender Ruge made a statement at 2.15am, denying any involvement in the offences.

16.   A crime scene having been established at the York Street premises, Bathurst Crime Scene police attended at about 4.10am on 4 January 2013 to conduct an examination. At least four separate ignition points were identified in the house, a clear and obvious pour pattern was identified in the front child's bedroom, the hallway and dining room were extensively damaged with the fire burning through the timber flooring, suggesting the use of an accelerant poured down the hallway and into the dining room. Numerous samples of carpet and wooden floorboards were collected and sent for analysis. The metal fuel tin was collected as an exhibit and identified as a five-litre Repco brand metal fuel container. There were no signs of forced entry to the premises although at least two windows appeared as if they had been left open.

17.   On Friday 4 January 2013, detectives attended the home of Kerry Buckman. She confirmed that she had given her son $10 to buy fuel the night before. Police then attended the BP service station in Darling Street, Forbes, and obtained the CCTV footage of Buckman purchasing the fuel shortly before the fire was lit.

18.   On Monday 7 January 2013, police arrested the offenders Buckman and Cormack at a house in Parkes. Buckman was interviewed and denied buying fuel at the BP or lighting the fires.

19.   The offender Cormack was also interviewed and made partial admissions. He admitted to being present with Buckman and Dalton when they picked up Ruge's car. He admitted to being present inside the vehicle when Buckman collected the $10 from his mother, bought the fuel from the BP service station, and entered and set fire to the house. He admitted to being present when the vehicle was driven into bushland and set alight by Buckman. He said that he had had a conversation with Ruge a few days before the offences where Ruge had spoken of doing an ""insurance job"". When asked about his foreknowledge of the offences, Cormack said that he ""knew something was going on but didn't want to ask questions"".

20.   On 7 January 2013, Buckman and Cormack were charged in relation to this matter.

21.   On 19 April 2013, detectives attended Wellington Gaol and spoke to the offender Buckman at his request. During the interview he made full admissions of lighting the fire at the premises in York Street on the night of 3 January 2013 and later setting fire to the vehicle. He said that he had committed the offences pursuant to an agreement with Ruge, that she would pay him $14,000 when she received the insurance payout. He also said that on the afternoon of 3 January 2013, the day of the offences, Ruge had given him $1,000 in cash as well as a small amount of cannabis as part payment for the offence he was about to commit. He said that he received this payment at the same time that Ruge gave him the keys to her house and car.

22.   About 3.30pm on Friday 19 April 2013, Ruge was placed under arrest and conveyed to Forbes Police Station. She declined to speak to a solicitor and was interviewed, at which time she again denied any involvement. She said that all the people who had made statements were lying, and that the allegations were crazy. She was then charged.

23.   The offender Ruge had contents insurance with the NRMA for $50,000 and a full comprehensive motor vehicle policy on her car in the amount of $15,000. On 4 January 2013, she lodged claims with the NRMA for both the home contents and the motor vehicle.

24.   The NRMA did not pay the claims (apart from an emergency payment of $1,000), however suffered a total loss of $19,007.49 for expenses incurred in investigating the matter, in respect of which the NRMA seeks compensation. 25. The offender Cormack was not aware of the agreement that had been C reached between Buckman and Ruge as to the payment of money to Buckman in exchange for committing the offences. By his plea of guilty, the offender Cormack accepts that he was part of a joint criminal enterprise with Buckman to commit the offences to which he has pleaded guilty. Cormack provided encouragement to Buckman to commit the offences by being present and ready to assist if required.

26.   For the purposes of these agreed facts, Ruge has not conceded the accuracy of Buckman's assertions in his police interview to the effect that Ruge had given him $1,000 and some cannabis on the day the offences were committed. Nor does Ruge concede that the agreement with Buckman was for the payment of $14,000. Ruge concedes that the agreement was for the payment of no less than $6,000. Although the Agreed Facts indicate that Cormack was not aware of the agreement reached between Buckman and Ruge as to the payment of money, as set out at para 19 of the Facts, the circumstances in which he had had a conversation a few days before the offence with Ruge where she had spoken of doing an insurance job and his acknowledgement that he knew that something was going on but did not want to ask questions, as well as his evidence that he at least anticipated benefiting by Buckman providing drugs to him because Buckman would be getting money, indicates as a matter of common sense that without any express communication, he must have anticipated that Buckman was not committing the offences because of some delight in setting fires, but in order to obtain a benefit for himself as well as a benefit for Ms Ruge by way of the insurance claims.

Exhibit 4 and Exhibit 5 are letters tendered by the Crown. Exhibit 4 is a letter from NRMA Insurance dated 22 April 2014, which inter-alia indicates that they had paid $1,000 directly to Ms Ruge, and had incurred $15,7094.92 in assessment and investigation costs for the claim relating to Ms Ruge's vehicle and contents claims, giving a total, according to the letter, of $16,794.92. I note that at para 24 of the Agreed Facts are, however, that the NRMA suffered a total loss of $19,007.49.

Exhibit 5 is a letter from Commlnsure, which indicates that the premises at 143 York Street, Forbes, had been insured by Michael James, and that as a result of the offending conduct on 3 January, the insurer had experienced a loss of $281,683.98. The letter is dated 25 February 2014, and is addressed to Detective Andrew McGrath. Commlnsure indicates that it is seeking restitution in respect of that sum and a further sum to be paid to Mr Michael James of $200, being the insured's excess. The total potential losses to the insurers were: $281,683.98 for the building and contents insured by Michael James, $50,000 for the personal contents of Ms Ruge, and $15,000, being the agreed value of the motor vehicle, being almost $350,000 in total had the claims been successful, that is, had not simply the claim by Mr James been successful, as it was, but also the claims made by Ms Ruge.”


	
	His Honour made similar findings of fact when he came to sentence Mr Buckman. In accordance with her duty of fairness and candour, and somewhat against her interests in resisting the grounds based on parity, the learned Crown Advocate directed the Court’s attention to the primary Judge’s finding that “the role and moral culpability of the offender Mr Buckman must be seen as being equal to that of Ms Ruge.”
	


MITIGATING FEATURES AND PERSONAL CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE APPLICANTS


	
	Both applicants pleaded guilty in the Local Court and King DCJ reduced their sentences by 25% for the utilitarian value of their pleas. His Honour summarised the material tendered on their behalf and the following brief outline is a condensed version of the relevant part of his Honour’s judgment on sentence.
	
	
	Ms Ruge was born in November 1989. She was 23 years old at the time of the offences and 24 when she stood to be sentenced. She had a child (a four year old son) but had broken up with the father of that child and was living with her parents by the time of sentence. She had no criminal convictions but developed a drug and alcohol dependency in her early twenties. His Honour noted that was then a “significant period of engagement with the criminal milieu”. She undertook rehabilitation programmes during the period of remand. She had been in a residential programme but had not spent time in custody. The primary Judge treated this as “quasi custody” and gave her credit for two (of four) months spent in residential rehabilitation. Ms Ruge presented with excellent references and had a reasonable record of employment since leaving school. However, her drug problem caused her to leave her job. Her efforts at overcoming her drug problem were impressive. She spent time in Bloomfield Psychiatric Hospital as well as the residential rehabilitation facility. The primary Judge questioned whether “she fully realised the significance of her offending behaviour” but accepted that she had “demonstrated genuine remorse and contrition”. According to the sentencing Judge, she “could readily be described as a person of general good character”, prior to developing her drug habit and leaving her job.
	
	
	Mr Cormack was born on 12 June 1992. He was 20 years old at the time of the offences and almost 22 at the time of sentence. He had a criminal history commencing in the Children’s Court. This included some serious offences including demanding property with menaces (2012), armed with intent (2013) and a common assault resulting in a full time gaol sentence (2013). King DCJ referred to the criminal record as “appalling”. Because of a “family breakdown”, the applicant was raised by an older sister. She died in a car accident when the applicant was 12 years of age and he entered a “downhill spiral”. He had not had a job since he left school. King DCJ was not satisfied that he was genuinely remorseful but noted that he had made some “partial admissions” on arrest and considered this to be “some evidence of remorse and contrition.” His Honour was not satisfied that there were good prospects of rehabilitation and found that Mr Cormack had a “high risk of re-offending”. King DCJ said the only thing in his favour was that he was still a relatively young man and would benefit from supervision.
	


Ruge Ground 1; Cormack Ground 5:The sentencing Judge erred in taking into account irrelevant considerations regarding the potential for a fire to spread and the risk to others.


	
	After setting out the agreed statement of facts, King DCJ made a number of observations concerning the seriousness of the offence. The applicants contend that some of these remarks disclose error. His Honour said:
	


“The potential for a fire to spread to other buildings, whether commercial or domestic, is always a substantial risk with a house fire. Not only does it create a risk to the property of others but also the lives of others who may be potentially resident or present in other premises or building in the vicinity.”


	
	Later he said:
	


“There is also always a significant risk to emergency personnel and police who attend that they may suffer individual harm as a result of their attendance to deal with the incident.”


	
	The applicants contend that, on the evidence led in this case, these findings were not open or available to inform a proper assessment of the objective criminality of the individual offences. It was submitted that there was no evidence to support the finding that there was a “substantial” or “significant” risk of the additional damage contemplated. The applicant says that the only relevant evidence pointed in the opposite direction. That evidence was the part of the statement of facts where it was said that “the premises located at 143 York Street, Forbes was a single detached house”.
	
	
	The applicants pointed to the observations in Porter v R [2008] NSWCCA 145 where Johnson J referred to the variety of circumstances in which arson could occur and some of the factors that were relevant to an assessment of the objective seriousness of any individual offence. The factors included:
	


“(i) The potential risk of injury to others.

(ii) The possible spread of the fire.”


	
	The applicants submitted that the evidence did not permit an adverse finding in relation to those two factors.
	
	
	The respondent submitted that the comments were unremarkable and that there is, in almost every case of arson, a risk of the fire spreading and a risk of harm to fire fighters. Those factors are the reason that a higher maximum penalty is prescribed where damage is by means of fire or explosion. The respondent pointed to the structure of the provisions creating the offences and made reference to the second reading speech in which the Attorney General explained that where property is damaged by fire or explosion there is an increased maximum penalty because of the kinds of risks to which his Honour referred.
	
	
	Section 195(1) creates an offence of destroying or damaging property. Such an offence carries a maximum penalty of five years’ imprisonment. If the damage is caused by means of a fire or explosion that maximum penalty is increased to 10 years. Subsection (1A) contains the same distinction for the offence when committed in company. The basic maximum penalty for deliberately damaging property while in company is six years. If the damage is caused by means of a fire or explosion the maximum penalty is increased to 11 years. Section 197 has the additional element of the offence being motivated “dishonestly, with a view to making a gain” and maintains the same structure. An offence of damaging property with the dishonest intention carries a maximum penalty of seven years while the same offence committed by means of a fire or explosion carries a maximum penalty of 14 years.
	
	
	When the sections were introduced the Attorney General told Parliament that:
	


“a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment is provided as the potential harm is increased by the use of fire or explosion. For this offence it is not necessary that the deed and intent to defraud or injure as it is the present requirement for certain arson offences it is sufficient that the damage was caused by the use of fire or explosives.”


	
	In R v Glover [2002] NSWCCA 376 Dunford J (with whom Ipp AJA and Studdert J agreed) referred at [56] to the second reading speech and said that “the use of the words ‘potential harm’ as opposed to ‘damage’ strongly suggest that the Attorney was referring to potential risk to other persons”.
	
	
	It can be accepted that the use of fire and explosion carries with it a risk that the fire may spread and may endanger the lives of other people (including fire fighters etc) indirectly. An observation that the offence generically is a serious one for that reason is not objectionable. The question is whether the remarks in the present case were of such a nature or whether they were remarks directed to an assessment of the objective criminality in the present case. That question must be answered by reference to a consideration of the judgment on sentence read as a whole and the impugned comments read in context.
	
	
	The context in which the comments appear in the remarks on sentence creates an ambiguity. The passage commences with the words “the offences brought against each of the offenders … must be regarded as very serious offences”. There is then a reference to the specific property particularised in the charges (“a motor vehicle and the residential premises and its contents as to use Mr Cormack’s words ‘an insurance job’”). His Honour then described the “sum potentially at risk” and then made the remarks to which exception is taken. That context would suggest that his Honour was assessing the objective criminality of this particular case, rather than referring to the seriousness of offences of arson in a general or generic sense. I accept that if his Honour was making a finding that increased the relative objective criminality of the particular offence within the genus created by the ss 195 and 197, there needed to be something more than the evidence presented in the District Court.
	
	
	On the other hand, each of the impugned comments commences with the words “is always” and “also always”. The use of the word “always” suggests that his Honour was making a more general reference to offences of arson.
	
	
	Resolution of this ground is difficult. On a reading of the whole of remarks (and putting aside the sentencing outcome), I am not satisfied that King DCJ fell into the error contended for by the applicants. Standing alone, I would not be satisfied that this ground justifies intervention. However, it does not stand alone.
	


Ruge Ground 2-3:The sentencing Judge erred in failing to make a finding of the existence of special circumstances and adjusting the ratio of the non-parole period to the head sentence to a greater extent than he did.The sentence is manifestly excessive


	
	On its face, the second ground argued on behalf of Ms Ruge is an assertion that the learned sentencing Judge erred in failing to find special circumstances under s 44 of the Sentencing Act. However, the way in which the matter was argued involved the submission that that failure gave rise to a justifiable sense of grievance when comparison is made with the non-parole component of the sentence later imposed on Mr Buckman. It is in this regard that the finding made as to their equal criminality is significant.
	
	
	Mr Buckman was a person with a number of previous offences on his record albeit that those offences were dealt with in the Children’s Court. On the other hand, he was younger than Ms Ruge. However both offenders were quite young and both presented evidence as to efforts that they had made towards rehabilitation. While Ms Ruge presented to the Court with no previous convictions on her record, there was evidence that she had a significant drug problem at the time of the offences, had fallen in with a bad crowd (the “criminal milieu” as the primary Judge put it) and that she had taken steps to overcome those problems.
	
	
	The same kind of material that led his Honour to find special circumstances in Mr Buckman’s case would rationally lead to a similar finding in Ms Ruge’s case. On an entirely superficial analysis, it is a surprising result that a person with no prior offences on their record should receive a more severe sentence than an offender who comes to Court with a significant record of previous offending. I accept that in some circumstances the result will be that the person with the record may obtain the benefit of a finding of special circumstances because of their need for a longer period of supervision upon their release from prison. Further, it has been said “disparity is unlikely to be found in relation to a finding of special circumstances in relation to one co-offender and not another”: Lau v R [2010] NSWCCA 43 at [15] (McClellan CJ at CL). However, his Honour went on to say:
	


“However, Howie J accepted [in R v Do], as do I that there may be cases where all relevant facts and circumstances being equal, a finding of special circumstances in the case of one offender and not in the other may give rise to a justifiable sense of grievance.”


	
	The issue has been contemplated in a variety of factual circumstances: see, for example R v Wahabzadah [2001] NSWCCA 253, Tatana v R [2006] NSWCCA 398, R v Do [2005] NSWCCA 209.
	
	
	Even if it is accepted (as was put by the respondent) that Mr Buckman was at a “crossroads” in his life, the circumstance of the present case did not suggest that Mr Buckman had a greater need for an extended period of supervision upon his release than did Ms Ruge.
	
	
	The application of principles of equal justice and parity are not to be applied with technicality but by reference to the substance of the case. In Green and Quinn v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; 244 CLR 462 it was said at [30]:
	


“30.   The foundation of the parity principle in the norm of equality before the law requires that its application be governed by consideration of substance rather than form.”


	
	As Dawson and Gaudron JJ said in Postiglione v The Queen [1997] HCA 26; 189 CLR 295 at 301-302:
	


“The parity principle upon which the argument in this Court was mainly based is an aspect of equal justice. Equal justice requires that like should be treated alike but that, if there are relevant differences, due allowance should be made for them. In the case of co-offenders, different sentences may reflect different degrees of culpability or their different circumstances. If so, the notion of equal justice is not violated. On some occasions, different sentences may indicate that one or other of them is infected with error. Ordinarily, correction of the error will result in there being a due proportion between the sentences and there will then be equal justice. However, the parity principle, as identified and expounded in Lowe v The Queen, recognises that equal justice requires that, as between co-offenders, there should not be a marked disparity which gives rise to ""a justifiable sense of grievance"". If there is, the sentence in issue should be reduced, notwithstanding that it is otherwise appropriate and within the permissible range of sentencing options.

Discrepancy or disparity is not simply a question of the imposition of different sentences for the same offence. Rather, it is a question of due proportion between those sentences, that being a matter to be determined having regard to the different circumstances of the co-offenders in question and their different degrees of criminality. The different circumstances involved in this case, namely, the fact that Savvas was the principal organiser in both conspiracies and that Postiglione rendered significant assistance to police and prosecuting authorities, clearly require that Postiglione receive a markedly lesser sentence than that imposed on Savvas.

If regard is had solely to the head sentences – 25 years in the case of Savvas, 18 years in Postiglione's case - the difference may fairly be regarded as reflecting their different roles in the conspiracies in respect of which they were convicted and Postiglione's subsequent co-operation with police and prosecuting authorities. However, the head sentence is but one component of the sentences. A proper comparison involves a consideration of all components.

One component of each of the sentences involved in this case and one which is susceptible of easy comparison is the non-parole period.”


	
	I am satisfied that there was an error, in the sense of an unjustified inconsistency, in the approach to special circumstances taken in the two cases. Although the ground was not formulated as a parity ground per se, I am satisfied that Ms Ruge is entitled to a “justifiable sense of grievance” as a consequence of the disparity between the respective non-parole periods imposed on her and Mr Buckman.
	
	
	In those circumstances, it is perhaps unnecessary to deal with the contention in Ground 3 that the sentence is manifestly excessive. However, in my assessment, the aggregate sentence imposed on Ms Ruge can properly be described as manifestly excessive in the sense that it was “unreasonable” or “plainly unjust”. Even though the offence was a very serious one and the loss to the insurance companies of some magnitude, it was an offence with very little planning and was carried out in a most amateur way. The subjective features of Ms Ruge were such that the objective seriousness had to be balanced against the individual circumstances of her case. As Mr Averre pointed out, the starting point was in excess of four and a half years and his Honour also said that he gave her (two months) credit for four months that she spent in a residential rehabilitation programme. That means that the starting point was approaching five years. That is excessive for a first offender of 24 years of age who had taken great strides towards rehabilitation.
	


Cormack Ground 1: The learned sentencing Judge contravened the principle in R v De Simoni (1981) 147 CLR 383 by sentencing the applicant on the basis that he believed his co-offenders would financially benefit from their crimes by way of a fraudulent insurance claim.


	
	Mr Cormack contends under Ground 1 that comments made by the sentencing Judge infringed the principles in R v De Simoni [1981] HCA 21; 147 CLR 383. His Honour referred to the fact that the applicant was aware that it was an “insurance job” and that he knew that Ms Ruge “was to gain substantially”. His Honour said that the applicant must have believed that it was not simply a matter of gaining the value of the car and her property present in the premises but also the value of the house. The full text of the impugned remark is as follows:
	


“Mr Cormack was aware of the ‘insurance job’ at least from some days before, and took part in the joint criminal enterprise to commit the offences and was present, intending by his presence to provide encouragement for the offender Buckman to set fire to the vehicle and the house, and being ready to assist him in doing so if required. He must have appreciated that the intention in performing ""an insurance job"" was that at least Ms Ruge, with whom he had been in a sexual relationship for approximately two weeks, was to gain substantially, indeed on his evidence, believing that Ms Ruge was in fact the owner of the house, he must have believed that it was not simply a matter of her gaining the value of the car and her property present in the premises, but also the value of the house.”


	
	As has been seen, s 197 creates an offence carrying a maximum penalty of 14 years whereas s 195 creates an offence carrying 10 years or (when committed in company) 11 years. The element of “dishonestly, with a view to making a gain for that person or another” is a factual circumstance that aggravates the criminality of a particular case and exposes an offender to a higher penalty. In R v De Simoni, Gibbs CJ (with whom Mason and Murphy JJ agreed) said at 392:
	


“It is not only in cases in which the offence has been accompanied by circumstances of aggravation that a trial judge may be required, in sentencing, to take an artificially restricted view of the facts. This will be so also in cases where the jury's verdict is inconsistent with the view of the facts that the judge himself has formed, for the judge cannot act on a view of the facts which conflicts with the jury's verdict. However, where the Crown has charged the offender with, or has accepted a plea of guilty to, an offence less serious than the facts warrant, it cannot rely, or ask the judge to rely, on the facts that would have rendered the offender liable to a more serious penalty.”


	
	As acknowledged by Gibbs CJ, the application of these principles may result in an artificial fact finding exercise. The present case provides an example. The agreed facts referred to the applicant’s admission on arrest that he knew that “Ruge had spoken of doing an ‘insurance job’”. It was this evidence, along with his evidence that Ms Ruge told him that she owned the house, that led the primary Judge to make the findings that he did. It is perhaps unfortunate that the detail of the applicant’s admission remained in the agreed facts tendered before King DCJ. It seems to have led his Honour into error. Nevertheless, the principle must be applied. A reading of the judgment on sentence establishes that his Honour took into account a circumstance of aggravation that was not charged against Cormack but which exposed him to a more severe maximum penalty.
	
	
	I have taken into account the submission of the respondent pointing to various parts of the remarks or judgment on sentence where his Honour referred to other parts of the agreed facts. However, the passages to which the applicant refers leads me to conclude that error is established. I would uphold Ground 1.
	


Cormack Grounds 2-4:The learned sentencing Judge erred in finding that the applicant’s role was substantial. The sentence imposed on the applicant was manifestly excessiveThe applicant has a justifiable sense of grievance arising out of the disparity between the sentence he received and those imposed on his co-offenders.


	
	It is convenient to deal with Grounds 2, 3 and 4 together. They all hinge on an assertion that the primary Judge erred in his assessment of the applicant’s criminality and role in the offences. This led his Honour to impose a sentence that was manifestly excessive and one which lacked due proportion with the sentence imposed on Ms Ruge and Mr Buckman thereby engendering a justifiable sense of grievance in Mr Cormack. The critical passage in his Honour’s remarks was when he described the applicant’s role in the offending as being “substantial”. The full context in which that passage appeared was this:
	


“Although offenders who participate in a joint criminal enterprise are equally liable for the actions of the other co-offenders, and accordingly, all other matters being equal, the same sentence, there is at least some distinction as conceded by the Crown as to his participation being less than that of Mr Buckman. Nonetheless, his role was still a substantial one.""


	
	As Mr Nash pointed out, the concession made by the Crown at first instance was stronger than that passage suggested. The advocate appearing for the Crown at sentence properly conceded that “the criminality of Mr Cormack is significantly less than that of Ms Ruge and Mr Buckman”. He described his role as “his presence emboldening Mr Buckman to carry out the offence of lighting the fires but that concession is made your Honour”. On the hearing of the appeal, there was some discussion as to the meaning of the word “substantial” and the flexibility with which that word is used in legal discourse. The word has received judicial consideration particularly in the context of statutory interpretation. Deane J once famously said that it was a word more appropriate “to a maze than to legislative provisions exposing officials of unions and others to action for substantial damages”: Tillmanns Butcheries Pty Ltd v Australasian Meat Industry Employees’ Union (1979) 42 FLR 331. In DPP v Losurdo (1998) 44 NSWLR 618 the Court (Priestley and Handley JJA and Sheppard AJA) noted that Deane J went on to say that:
	


“[t]he word substantial was not only susceptible of ambiguity; it was a word calculated to conceal a lack of precision. Deane J said that, in the phrase ‘substantial loss or damage’, ‘substantial’ could, in an appropriate context, mean real or of substance as distinct from ephemeral or nominal. He added that it could also mean, large, weighty or big. It could be used in a relative sense or could indicate an absolute significance, quantity or size.”


	
	The Court concluded in DPP v Losurdo (622) that:
	


“These cases emphasise that there is no point in endeavouring to ascertain the meaning of the word ‘substantial’ by reference to a number of synonyms. The word is an ordinary English word and must be given its ordinary meaning in the context in which it appears.”


	
	Plainly, the meaning of the word “substantial” turns on the context in which it is used. The context here was an assessment of the role of the offender for the purpose of determining his objective criminality both generally and relative to his co-offenders. In that context, I am unable to see how the role that Mr Cormack played can properly be described as a substantial one. Apart from being present throughout the enterprise, there was no evidence that he did anything to actually encourage or embolden Mr Buckman in setting the fires or in making his escape.
	
	
	I have previously expressed some misgivings concerning the authorities in New South Wales as to the approach of an intermediate appellate Court in dealing with a ground that asserts error in a sentencing Judge’s assessment of the relative objective criminality: see Kaminic v R [2014] NSWCCA 116 at [79]-[89]. However, in Sabongi v R [2015] NSWCCA 25 at [70]-[71] I acknowledged that the law appeared to be settled and that the approach urged by Spigelman CJ and Simpson J in Mulato v R [2006] NSWCCA 282 applied. Accordingly, the question is whether it was open to King DCJ to categorize Mr Cormack’s role as “a substantial one”.
	
	
	I am satisfied that it was not open to categorise Mr Cormack’s role in the offences as “substantial”. The primary Judge overstated his role and erred in his assessment of the objective criminality. Ground 2 is made out and this in turns satisfies me that Grounds 3 and 4 must also be upheld.
	


Re-sentencing


	
	In Kentwell v The Queen [2014] HCA 37; 88 ALJR 947 at [42]-[43] French CJ, Hayne, Bell and Keane JJ set out the correct approach to s 6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) in a case where this Court finds error in the sentencing process:
	


“When a judge acts upon wrong principle, allows extraneous or irrelevant matters to guide or affect the determination, mistakes the facts or does not take into account some material consideration, the Court of Criminal Appeal does not assess whether and to what degree the error influenced the outcome. The discretion in such a case has miscarried and it is the duty of the Court of Criminal Appeal to exercise the discretion afresh taking into account the purposes of sentencing and the factors that the Sentencing Act, and any other Act or rule of law, require or permit. As sentencing is a discretionary judgment that does not yield a single correct result, it follows that a range of sentences in a given case may be said to be ""warranted in law"". A sentence that happens to be within the range but that has been imposed as the result of a legally flawed determination is not ""warranted in law"" unless, in the exercise of its independent discretion, the Court of Criminal Appeal determines that it is the appropriate sentence for the offender and the offence. This is not to say that all errors in the sentencing of offenders vitiate the exercise of the sentencer's discretion. By way of example, s 44(1) of the Sentencing Act requires the court when sentencing an offender to imprisonment to first set the non-parole period and then set the balance of the term. Prior to 1 February 2003, a court was required to first set the term of the sentence and then specify the non-parole period. A court which sentences an offender to imprisonment after 1 February 2003 by first setting the term of the sentence commits legal error. Without more, the error does not affect the exercise of the sentencer's discretion.

After having identified specific error of the kind described in House, the Court of Criminal Appeal may conclude, taking into account all relevant matters, including evidence of events that have occurred since the sentence hearing, that a lesser sentence is the appropriate sentence for the offender and the offence. This is a conclusion that that lesser sentence is warranted in law. The result of the Court of Criminal Appeal's independent exercise of discretion may be the conclusion that the same sentence or a greater sentence is the appropriate sentence. In neither case is the Court required to re-sentence. Nor is the Court required to re-sentence in a case in which it concludes that a lesser sentence is appropriate for one or more offences, but that a greater sentence is appropriate for another or other offences, with the result that the aggregate sentence that it considers warranted in law exceeds the aggregate sentence that is the subject of appeal.”


	
	Like the sentencing Judge, I am of the opinion that it is appropriate to impose aggregate sentence pursuant to s 53A of the Sentencing Act. The commencement dates of the sentences, taking into account the different periods of pre-sentence custody, were agreed in the District Court. The sentence must reflect the purposes of sentencing in s 3A of the Sentencing Act. The offenders must be adequately punished and their conduct must be denounced. The sentences must send a clear message that such conduct will be met with serious punishment. The harm to the victims must be recognised. The community must be protected from the offender and, in this case, that may best be served by another purpose of sentencing, namely promoting the rehabilitation of the offenders.
	
	
	In Ms Ruge’s case, I take into account the period of “quasi custody” when the applicant was in residential rehabilitation. I would allow a discount of 25% for the plea of guilty. I take into account the serious objective criminality involved in each offence, noting that the total loss to the insurance company resulting from the house fire was substantially greater than that involved in destruction to the car. Having considered all possible alternatives, I am satisfied for the purpose of s 5 of the Sentencing Act that no sentence other than imprisonment is appropriate. The offences were part of the one enterprise but involved separate acts and discrete damage. But for the imposition of an aggregate sentence, it would have been appropriate that the sentences be largely concurrent but with a degree of accumulation. For the purpose of s 53A(2)(b), I record that the individual sentences that I would have imposed are 18 months (for the offence involving the motor car) and two years three months (for the offence involving the property within the house). I would find special circumstances pursuant to s 44(2B) of the Sentencing Act. Those circumstances are that Ms Ruge is a person without previous criminal convictions but with a history of drug abuse who will benefit from a longer than usual period of supervised parole.
	
	
	In the result, I would propose an aggregate sentence of three years with an aggregate non-parole period of two years. Pursuant to s 50 of the Sentencing Act, she is entitled to be released at the expiration of the non-parole period.
	
	
	In Mr Cormack’s case, I take into account his limited role in the two offences. However, at the time of the offences he was on a deferred sentence bond (s 9 Sentencing Act) for damaging property and a suspended sentence bond (s 12 Sentencing Act) for being armed with intent. The breach of conditional liberty is an aggravating feature. No sentence other than imprisonment is appropriate in all of the circumstances. I would provide a 25% discount for his plea of guilty. I take into account his youth but note that his criminal history disentitles him to leniency. I am guarded as to his prospects of rehabilitation. His response to supervision in the past has been poor. I take the same approach to accumulation and concurrency as I have in Ms Ruge’s case. I record indicative sentences of 12 months for the offence involving the vehicle and 18 months for the offence involving the property in the house. I cannot identify special circumstances justifying a reduction in the non-parole period that would apply by application of s 44 of the Sentencing Act although I will round down the non-parole period in favour of the offender. I would propose an aggregate (total) sentence of one year and nine months with an aggregate non-parole period of one year and three months.
	
	
	I propose the following orders in Ms Ruge’s case:
	



	
	Leave to appeal granted.
	
	
	Appeal allowed.
	
	
	Quash the sentence imposed in the District Court.
	
	
	In lieu thereof, impose an aggregate sentence comprising a non-parole period of two years commencing on 15 May 2014 and expiring on 14 May 2016 with a balance of term of twelve months commencing 15 May 2016 and expiring 14 May 2017.
	
	
	Pursuant to s 50 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) direct that the offender be released at the expiration of the non-parole period.
	



	
	I propose the following order in Mr Cormack’s case:
	



	
	Leave to appeal granted.
	
	
	Appeal allowed.
	
	
	Quash the sentence imposed in the District Court.
	
	
	In lieu thereof, impose an aggregate sentence comprising a non-parole period of one year and three months commencing on 21 April 2014 and expiring on 20 July 2015 with a balance of term of six months commencing 21 July 2015 and expiring 20 January 2016.
	
	
	Pursuant to s 50 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) direct that the offender be released at the expiration of the non-parole period.

2703213,Vella v R; Siskos v R [2015] NSWCCA 148,"Judgment


	
	GLEESON JA: I have had the benefit of reading in draft the reasons of Beech-Jones J.
	


Ms Vella


	
	In relation to the applicant Esther Vella, I agree with his Honour's reasons in respect of grounds 1, 4, 5 and 6 of the appeal against conviction. In relation to ground 7, I would refuse leave to raise this ground. I otherwise agree with the orders which his Honour has proposed.
	
	
	I also agree with his Honour's reasons and the orders he has proposed in respect of Ms Vella's appeal against sentence.
	
	
	My reasons for refusing leave to raise ground 7 of the conviction appeal may be stated briefly.
	
	
	Ground 7 of Ms Vella's amended grounds of appeal filed 27 April 2015 was in the following terms:
	


“That, in the event of a finding that there was an unreasonable verdict against Mr Siskos, the Court should hold that there was no agreement to support the charge of conspiracy, and that there was an unreasonable verdict against the appellant.”


	
	Ground 7 was referred to in the amended submissions of Ms Vella in support of her conviction appeal, but as Beech-Jones J observes (at [71]), those written submissions did not contain anything in support of that ground and no oral submissions were directed to this ground. However, the absence of any written or oral submissions in support of this ground may be taken as a reflection of the contingent nature of this ground.
	
	
	As expressed, ground 7 is contingent upon this Court finding that there was an unreasonable verdict against the co-accused, Mr Siskos. It is only necessary to note that no such ground of appeal was relied upon by Mr Siskos in his appeal against conviction, and the dismissal of Mr Siskos' appeal has the consequence that the premise of ground 7 is not made out. It follows, in my view, that leave to appeal should be refused in respect of this ground.
	
	
	Against the possibility that ground 7 is to be read differently as suggesting an unreasonable verdict against Ms Vella irrespective of the outcome of Mr Siskos' conviction appeal, I have reviewed the evidence. As noted by Beech-Jones J, such review must be undertaken in circumstances where Ms Vella has not drawn attention to any particular matter or item of evidence in support of this ground of appeal. If, contrary to my view, leave to raise this ground should be granted, then for the reasons given by Beech-Jones J, and having reviewed the evidence, I agree that ground 7 should be rejected.
	


Mr Siskos


	
	In relation to the applicant Peter Siskos, I agree with his Honour's reasons in respect of grounds 1, 2 and 3 of the appeal against conviction, and the orders which his Honour has proposed.
	
	
	I also agree with his Honour's reasons and the orders he has proposed in respect of Mr Siskos' appeal against sentence.
	
	
	HIDDEN J: I agree with Beech-Jones J.
	
	
	As to ground 7 in Ms Vella’s appeal, that ground is curiously expressed. However, given that Mr Siskos does not advance a ground that the verdict against him was unreasonable, I do not see Ms Vella’s ground as being purely contingent upon such a finding by this court in his case. Rather, I see the ground as asserting that the evidence did not support the agreement between the two applicants alleged, and as amounting to a complaint by Ms Vella that the verdict of guilty against her is unreasonable. I am content to adopt the approach of Beech-Jones J to that ground.
	
	
	BEECH-JONES J: On 2 October 2013 the applicants, Esther Vella and Peter Siskos, were arraigned before a jury panel in the District Court on an indictment that contained two counts. The first count charged both of them with a crime under the common law of conspiring with each other to defraud an insurance company, OnePath Life Ltd (“OnePath”). The second count was an alternative to the first count. It charged both of them with an offence under s 192E(1)(b) of the Crimes Act 1900 of dishonestly obtaining a financial advantage in the form of a life insurance policy over the life of the applicant, Mr Siskos, by deception. The alleged deception was that they represented to OnePath that an application for the policy was “made in good faith when to the knowledge of [the applicants] it was not”. They pleaded not guilty to both counts.
	
	
	On 28 October 2013 the jury returned a verdict of guilty for each of Ms Vella and Mr Siskos to count 1. This verdict rendered it unnecessary to take a verdict of count 2.
	
	
	On 4 April 2014 Ms Vella was convicted and sentenced to a term of imprisonment of six years and six months commencing on 28 October 2013 and expiring on 27 July 2020. The Court fixed a non-parole period of four years and three months.
	
	
	On the same day Mr Siskos was convicted and sentenced to a term of imprisonment of two years and six months commencing 4 April 2014 and expiring on 3 September 2016. The Court fixed a non-parole period of fifteen months. The non-parole period expires on 3 July 2015. The short period of time between the publication of this judgment and the expiry of that period is solely a product of delay by Mr Siskos in pursuing these proceedings.
	
	
	Each of Ms Vella and Mr Siskos now seek to appeal their convictions and seek leave to appeal against their sentences. They also apply for various extensions of time.
	
	
	Ms Vella requires an extension of time up to an including 3 February 2015 to pursue both her appeal against conviction and her application for leave to appeal against sentence as the documents referred to in rule 23C of the Criminal Appeal Rules were not filed within six months of her filing a notice of intention to appeal against her conviction and sentence (Criminal Appeal Act 1912; s 10; Criminal Appeal rule 3A). In support of the application to extend time her solicitor swore an affidavit describing the difficulties he experienced obtaining copies of transcript and exhibits as well as securing funds to prosecute the appeal. While the entire period of the delay has not been fully explained I propose that the extension be granted, the appeal having now been fully argued.
	
	
	Mr Siskos does not need an extension of time to seek leave to appeal against his sentence but he requires an extension of time up to and including 21 April 2015 to appeal against his conviction. In support of the extension his solicitor has sworn an affidavit explaining that he was instructed on 2 March 2015 and describing the efforts he has made since that time. While this does not explain the delay prior to then I nevertheless propose that the extension be granted given that his appeal has also been fully argued.
	
	
	As Ms Vella contends that her conviction was unsafe and unsatisfactory, and to understand the various bases of challenge to the convictions, it is first necessary to outline the evidence said to support the Crown case as well as the contrary evidence.
	


The Crown Case


	
	In something of an understatement the trial judge described the Crown case as “somewhat extraordinary”. It was common ground that in July 2010 Ms Vella and Mr Siskos obtained a life insurance policy over Mr Siskos’ life from OnePath for the amount of $1,723,000.00 (the “policy”) and that Ms Vella was the ultimate beneficiary of the policy. The policy responded in the event that Mr Siskos committed suicide but only if it that occurred at least thirteen months after its inception date (the “preclusion period”). The preclusion period expired on 10 September 2011.
	
	
	The Crown alleged that, from a time commencing no later than when they obtained coverage through to a time after the expiry of the preclusion period, Ms Vella and Mr Siskos agreed that Mr Siskos would commit suicide so that Ms Vella could recover under the policy. It contended that, soon after the expiry of the preclusion period, Mr Siskos stopped attending work and lived in train stations in contemplation of committing suicide but that, in the words of one of the witnesses with whom Ms Vella agreed, he “chickened out” (see [61]).
	
	
	To address the grounds of appeal, it is necessary to explain what the real issues at the trial were. Consistent with authority, the trial judge directed the jury that a defrauding involved the intentional use of “dishonest means” to deprive another person of their property or to imperil their rights or interests (see Peters v R [1998] HCA 7; 192 CLR 493 at [30] per Toohey and Gaudron JJ). In this case the Crown did not allege that the fraud lay in the possible making of a claim but in the obtaining of a policy. The relevant imperilment was said to be the underwriting of an insurance policy by OnePath.
	
	
	The trial judge directed the jury as to the dishonest means that had been identified by the Crown as follows:
	


“The dishonest means which the Crown says the accused used here were making the application for insurance not in good faith by agreeing between themselves [that] the accused Peter Siskos [was] to commit suicide after the expiration of the exclusion period leaving the accused Esther Vella as the sole beneficiary. The Crown must establish beyond reasonable doubt that the accused had that knowledge, belief or intent and, if so, on that account the relevant conduct was dishonest. In determining whether the conduct of the accused was dishonest, the standards which you apply is that of ordinary decent people.” (emphasis added)


	
	The latter part of this direction was consistent with the meaning of “dishonest” stated in Peters at [18] and confirmed in McLeod v R (2003) 214 CLR 230 at [38] (per Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Hayne JJ; cf R v Ghosh [1982] QB 1053 and The Criminal Code 1995 (Cth), s 130.3).
	
	
	The reference by the trial judge to the application for the insurance policy not being made in “good faith” reflected the manner in which the Crown opened and closed its case although little was said at the trial as to what “good faith” meant in this context. Properly analysed, the Crown case, if accepted, involved dishonest means by the applicants in “concealing facts which they had a duty to disclose” (Peters at [84] per McHugh J); that is, on the Crown case the applicants deliberately omitted to inform OnePath of Mr Siskos’ intention to commit suicide knowing that they were obliged to disclose it. The reference to “good faith” in the directions should be so understood.
	
	
	A review of the trial transcript reveals that, other than at the time of the debate over the admission of additional evidence from OnePath’s underwriter which is the subject of ground 6 of Ms Vella’s conviction appeal, it was not truly in issue at the trial that, if Ms Vella and Mr Siskos entered into the agreement the Crown alleged they did, then that was a matter that each knew had to be disclosed to OnePath and the failure to do so involved “dishonest means”. Counsel for Mr Siskos did not make any submission on this issue to the jury. In his address to the jury Counsel for Ms Vella made reference to whether Ms Vella understood she had a “particular obligation” to disclose Mr Siskos’ alleged suicidal intentions to OnePath, but only in relation to the alternative count. He ultimately described the issue for the jury on count 1 as being whether it had been “established beyond reasonable” doubt that they have reached this agreement alleged by the Crown. Further, none of the Counsel appearing at the trial sought any further direction from the trial judge on the question of “dishonest means” after his Honour gave the above direction. No complaint is made about any aspect of his Honour’s directions in the grounds of appeal.
	
	
	It follows that count 1 being a charge of conspiracy, the real issue(s) at the trial in relation to count 1 was whether the Crown proved beyond reasonable doubt the existence of the agreement referred to in [22] and that each of the applicants intended to give effect to that agreement (Peters at [66] per McHugh J; R v LK (2010) 241 CLR 177 at [62] to [63] per French CJ, and at [110] per Gummow, Hayne, Crennan, Kiefel and Bell JJ). The balance of this judgment proceeds on that basis.
	


The applicants’ relationship


	
	At the time of the events the subject of the charges in the indictment Mr Siskos was 49 years of age. He was employed as a security guard. Ms Vella was 51. She worked as a casual schoolteacher. Ms Vella owned a house in Strathfield from which she operated a boarding house. She also leased a house in Cabarita at which she also accepted boarders.
	
	
	The Crown called Mr Siskos’ sister who stated that the applicants started dating in 1989 but the relationship was tumultuous. She said they broke up and reunited on a number of occasions although they remained friends, even during periods that Ms Vella dated other men. She also said that at times they referred to each other as brother and sister.
	
	
	The Crown pointed to two particular aspects of their relationship as especially supportive of its case.
	
	
	First, the Crown called a number of witnesses who testified to the effect that Ms Vella repeatedly asserted that Mr Siskos was to blame for her financial pressures and that he owed her a substantial amount of money. Some of that evidence was as follows.
	
	
	Ms Susan Byrne undertook some weekend cleaning work at the Cabarita premises from September 2010. She recounted Ms Vella repeating the “same kind of stories over and over again” to the effect that Mr Siskos “owed her money and stole from her and used her” and that he owed her “just under $700,000”. She recalled Ms Vella stating that “[s]he wanted [Mr Siskos] out of her life, she just wanted him out, she was sick of him, he was leaching off her”.
	
	
	Ms Christine Kodrun rented a room at the Cabarita property from February 2011 to October 2011. She recalled Ms Vella telling her that she owed approximately $700,000 in respect of the Strathfield property and that “Peter had accrued [that] debt” and that “otherwise she probably would’ve owned the property outright”.
	
	
	Ms Kristel Woodward rented a room at the Strathfield premises from late August 2011 until October 2011. She recalled many conversations with Ms Vella in which she complained about Mr Siskos causing her financial difficulties. She recalled that, in one conversation, Ms Vella was “very erratic, very emotional, teary” and that Ms Vella said “that she’d wished she’d never met Peter; that you know she would be a millionaire if she hadn’t met Peter; … that she wished he was dead”. She recalled Ms Vella asking her “did I know anybody that would, you know, kill him”. In cross examination she agreed that Ms Vella was “emotional” during this conversation but stated that there were “other times … where she has said that she wanted him gone, she has not been emotional”.
	
	
	Second, the Crown also called evidence to the effect that Ms Vella dominated Mr Siskos and he was compliant with her wishes. Ms Byrne recalled an occasion in November 2010 overhearing Ms Vella screaming at Mr Siskos “I want you out, I’m sick of you, you’ve cost me so much I’m fed up”. She said that Ms Vella continued to scream at him and that his response was “very-very quiet, very like just agreeing with her ‘Yes Esther, whatever’”. Ms Kodrun described Ms Vella and Mr Siskos’ relationship as “very strange”, that Ms Vella “was very domineering and very controlling towards Peter” and that “[h]e very much obeyed all her instructions”. She added that they had no “physical relationship” and there was “no emotional involvement or any hugging, or any, any physical contact”. A friend of Mr Siskos, Tony Shoesmith, recalled Mr Siskos saying in 2011 about Ms Vella that he “loved [Ms Vella] to pieces” and that “[h]is focus was work and Esther”.
	


Ms Jia Shi’s evidence – early 2010


	
	In February 2010 Ms Jia Shi occupied a room at the house in Cabarita. Ms Vella introduced her to Mr Siskos as her cousin. She recalled that he attended the house two to three times a week. She recalled that some weeks after she moved in she overheard an argument between Ms Vella and Mr Siskos in which Ms Vella “mentioned a debt … like … 750 thousand” and that:
	


“… Peter said ‘what do you want me to do?’ Esther said, Peter said ‘Do you want me to rob a bank or kill myself?’ and Esther said, ‘You can’t, you can’t either, you’re too stupid, you can’t even rob the bank, you’re not a bank robber. You can leave your wallet and fall over. Why don’t you increase your life insurance?”

She recalled that Mr Siskos replied “I don’t know”.


	
	Ms Shi said that on 19 March 2010 she had a conversation with Ms Vella in her bedroom in which Ms Vella complained about the financial pressure she was under. She recalled her mentioning a debt of $750,000. She recalled Ms Vella stating that “Peter should kill himself and his life will be sacrificed for homeless children”.
	
	
	Ms Shi said that on 24 March 2010 Ms Vella told her that “Peter should kill himself to pay for the debt”. She recalled Ms Vella mentioning a “Plan A” and a “Plan B” and that:
	


“[Ms Vella] said ‘Plan A is that Peter will increase the life insurance’ – so when he died the money call all go – she can get the money. ‘And the Plan B is sending Peter to kill Esther’s mother in Perth’.”


	
	Ms Shi recalled that Ms Vella stated that she preferred plan B “because at least Peter is of some use to me”. Ms Shi said that Ms Vella threatened her and her family and that she left the house almost immediately after that. She went to the library at the University she attended and typed a statement which she later provided to the police.
	


July 2010 – Obtaining the Policy


	
	Up until June 2010 Mr Siskos had life insurance cover with St George for just under $850,000.00.
	
	
	On 25 June 2010 Mr Siskos and Ms Vella consulted an insurance broker, Mr Wen Wang. Based on their instructions he prepared a joint financial plan. The plan recorded “family income needs” as $1,033,293 and the necessity to “clear debts” of $690,000. Mr Wang recommended, inter alia, obtaining life cover for Mr Siskos for $1,723,293.00 with the policy to be owned by his superannuation fund which would fund the annual premium of approximately $15,000.00. Mr Wang recorded Mr Siskos’ annual income as $74,213.00.
	
	
	On 30 June 2010 Mr Wang sent an email to OnePath asking for a waiver of the preclusion period for suicide. Mr Wang’s recollection was that the waiver was requested by the “client”. Mr Wang recalled that Mr Siskos “expressed his concern to me regarding the waiting period” and that was the only waiting period that he queried. The policy adopted a level premium structure, that is, one which provided for a relatively level rate of premium over a number of years by using a higher level of cost for the risk assumed in earlier years than would otherwise be the case to subsidise premium rates in later years. In cross examination Mr Wang agreed that a person intent on committing suicide at the expiry of the preclusion period could have minimised the cost of obtaining a benefit by adopting a stepped premium structure instead.
	
	
	On 2 July 2010 the applicants attended another meeting with Mr Wang. They accepted his recommendation. They completed and signed an application for an insurance policy with OnePath. It contained the standard advice concerning an insured’s duty of disclosure, a series of detailed questions and answers concerning Mr Siskos’ health including his mental health, and an acknowledgement by both that they understood their duty of disclosure and that cover was “conditional upon the life insured disclosing all matters known to them that are relevant to [OnePath’s] decision to issue any cover”. The application form nominated Ms Vella as the 100% beneficiary of the policy.
	
	
	OnePath’s underwriter for the policy was Ms Henriette Scheepers. Ms Scheepers accepted the risk on behalf of OnePath. She accepted that there was nothing unusual about the request for a waiver of the exclusion period and that OnePath agreed to the waiver to the extent that Mr Siskos was obtaining cover to the level he previously held with St George. One aspect of Ms Scheepers’ evidence is the subject of ground 6 of Ms Vella’s appeal against her conviction. The policy incepted from 10 August 2010. The amount of cover and the operation of the preclusion period have already been described.
	


The Malta money


	
	The Crown adduced evidence that Ms Vella repeatedly stated that she was due to receive a large amount of money from an inheritance from her family in Malta which she would use to pay off her debts. Relying on the evidence of Mr Appleby noted below at [53], the Crown contended that these assertions were false and they were in truth a reference to a large sum she expected to receive after Mr Siskos committed suicide.
	
	
	Ms Woodward recalled Ms Vella stating that a property in Malta had been “left to her and she was selling it” but was later told that the “original buyer had backed out and they were now waiting for another buyer for the property”. Ms Byrne recalled Ms Vella stating that she had “money coming from a … settlement of a property … maybe it was her father’s property he was selling or she was coming into an inheritance” and that it “was coming from Malta … in January of 2011”, and that when it arrived “she would be debt-free”. Ms Kodrun stated that Ms Vella told her “a minimum of 20 times” that “she was waiting on a large amount of money to come through on 15 September [2011] … from a sale of … property in Malta”. When that date passed and no funds were received, Ms Kodrun recalled Ms Vella explaining that the person who was purchasing the land had died “and the relatives were trying to deal with the situation so she wasn’t sure if it was going to come through”.
	


Other Admissions


	
	Each of Ms Woodward and Ms Byrne attributed other statements to Ms Vella that supported the Crown case. In her evidence Ms Woodward stated that Ms Vella often read Tarot cards and that “she advised me [that] in the tarot cards that she could see that Peter was going to commit suicide”. She also recalled that Ms Vella told her that “Peter had also brought it up on numerous occasions that he felt like he wasn’t going to make it to his 50th birthday”. Mr Siskos turned 50 on 1 November 2011.
	
	
	Ms Byrne recalled Ms Vella “talk[ing] about how much debt she was in”, making reference to her committing suicide and mentioning that Mr Siskos had also “talked about it”. In particular she recalled Ms Vella stating that Mr Siskos said:
	


“… That he would say ‘I’ve had enough, I’ve had enough of this’. The constant hounding – her hounding him, constantly giving out to him, constantly telling him how much he owed and how much he had cost her, that he would be better off – that he would be better off dead.”

October 2011


	
	As noted the preclusion period expired on September 2011. The Crown called Mr Tony Appleby who rented a room at the Strathfield property from Ms Vella. Some time in mid-October 2011 he arranged to meet Ms Vella at a hotel in Strathfield. He met her and Mr Siskos outside the front of the hotel. He heard Ms Vella say to Mr Siskos “the Malta money is coming soon, isn’t it?” Mr Siskos replying “Yeah” and shrugging his shoulders. Consistent with the other witnesses noted above, Mr Appleby said that before and after this meeting Ms Vella had repeatedly told him that she “was getting some money from Malta” although the date of its supposed arrival was put back. Mr Appleby recalled that she became “stressed about the [Malta] money”. He recalled that some time in this period Ms Vella referred to Mr Siskos and stated “Oh he’s gone again”.
	
	
	Mr Shoesmith stated that on Monday 10 October 2011 he arranged with Mr Siskos for him to attend at Mr Shoesmith’s home on Saturday 15 October 2011 to help move a fridge. On Thursday 13 October 2011 he met Mr Siskos for dinner. In cross examination he agreed that Mr Siskos had not seemed “any different to his normal self”. On Friday 14 October 2011 he received a telephone call from a co-worker of Mr Siskos stating that he had not attended work that day. He rang Mr Siskos and left messages. Mr Siskos did not return his call. Mr Shoesmith described this as “very unusual”. Mr Shoesmith drove to various worksites looking for Mr Siskos but could not find him. Mr Siskos did not attend to move the fridge on Saturday 15 October 2011.
	
	
	A few days later Mr Shoesmith rang one of Mr Siskos’ sisters and told her to report him missing to the police. On 24 October 2011 that sister, Ms Fossey, reported Mr Siskos missing.
	
	
	A few nights prior to 24 October 2011 Mr Appleby had a conversation with Ms Vella. She said to him “[a]ctually Tony, there’s just no Malta money”. Mr Appleby told the jury:
	


“… [s]he told me that Peter had agreed to commit suicide and they’d taken out an insurance policy and she would – and Esther would – when Peter was to die she would – Esther would get the insurance money and that’ll cover what he owed her and she told me that it’ll be – she told me a figure of 1.8 million and she told me that’d last her for 30 odd years and she’d see Peter up in heaven.”


	
	Mr Appleby also said that Ms Vella said that Mr Siskos was “going to jump in front of a train … at Croydon Station and commit suicide”, that Mr Siskos owed her $700,000 and that “it was supposed to happen in the next day or so”.
	
	
	On 24 October 2011 Mr Appleby saw two detectives at the front of the Strathfield property. They were investigating the missing person’s report lodged by Ms Fossey. Mr Appleby contacted Ms Vella and they attended the police station. Ms Vella provided a statement to the police, but it was not tendered at the trial. After they left the station, Mr Appleby said to her “if anything’s happened to Peter, the[n], if you’ve got anything that could incriminate you, you should she get rid of it”. This prompted Ms Vella to take Mr  Appleby on a tour of the outer western suburbs as she retrieved three laptop computers she hid in some bushes in a car park in Cabarita, collected some cassette tapes and paperwork from her home, threw the laptops into the Nepean River at Penrith and burnt the other items next to the river. They also retrieved and disposed of some more tapes and material from the bushes in a car park and Ms Vella’s home.
	
	
	On 25 October 2011 Mr Shoesmith made a statement to the police. On the next day, ie 26 October 2011, he received a telephone call and was told that Mr Siskos had been seen in Burwood. Mr Shoesmith found him in Burwood Park reading a book. Mr Shoesmith said that he looked “dishevelled” and as though he had been “living rough”. Mr Siskos told him “he’d just had enough and just rode the trains” and had slept on train platforms and “in a park during the day”.
	
	
	Mr Shoesmith took Mr Siskos to a police station. They arrived at 3:00pm on 26 October 2011. He participated in an electronically recorded interview. He told the police that he had been living on the streets for two weeks and staying on trains “and when the train stops … in the train station”. He was asked whether he was depressed about money problems and replied “yeah … it depressed me and, um, I’m even, like, ashamed to say, I just dumped everything in [Ms Vella’s] lap and just left it”. He denied having any intention to harm himself or having discussed collecting on his insurance policy. He stated that he was aware of the thirteen month preclusion clause as Mr Wang “pointed it out to us”. He denied that he owed Ms Vella money but accepted that he had “a responsibility to … help her”.
	
	
	Mr Appleby had second thoughts about his actions in assisting Ms Vella to destroy evidence. On 26 October 2011 he contacted the police. He took them to the locations at which he and Ms Vella had disposed of the various items noted above. The police were able to retrieve some items including the laptop computers, but they were unusable. However they also retrieved a number of audio cassette tapes from a public waste bin. One of these cassettes bore the label “Copy of Pete admitting he is a parasite”. The recording was played to the jury during the trial. A transcript of the recording was made available on the appeal. It recorded a dialogue between Ms Vella and Mr Siskos and other persons that was supportive of the Crown’s case, especially its characterisation of their relationship. There are repeated references to Ms Vella’s debts and Mr Siskos’ apparent responsibility for them. At one point Mr Siskos states:
	


“I’m definitely sure, I want the money if I pass away, or when, to cover the debt, ah, that I’ve left behind.”

“To be honest with you, I don’t care about myself at the moment cause I got too many things worrying about what Esther’s going to. What going to happen with her afterwards. How’s she going to cope, and for me, if I pass away … well I’ll be a very simplistic bloke, if I go I go. I just don’t, the main thing that’s bothering me is leaving all this … debt.”


	
	On the evening of 26 October 2011 Mr Appleby telephoned Esther Vella and arranged to meet her at Burwood RSL on 28 October 2011.
	
	
	Prior to the meeting at the Burwood RSL, police conducted surveillance on the applicants. A police officer observed them in the carpark of the Burwood RSL having a conversation that lasted fourteen minutes which he described as an “animated conversation and they were both waving their arms around”. He observed Ms Vella then walked into the Burwood RSL to see Mr Appleby. Mr Siskos left.
	
	
	Mr Appleby attended the meeting with Ms Vella at the Burwood RSL fitted with a listening device. Their meeting was recorded. The tape was not available to this Court but a transcript of the conversation was provided. On behalf of Ms Vella it was contended that it did not record any admissions by her (see [79]). An edited transcript of the discussion was made available to the Court. It is replete with references to suicide involving a train, the destruction of incriminating evidence and her lost opportunity to obtain an insurance payout. It included the following exchange:
	


“Esther Vella: ‘They knew about the train thing, so someone has told them.”

Tony Appleby: “The what sorry?”

Esther Vella: “They knew about the train thing.”

Tony Appleby: “Okay, yeah, yeah.”

Esther Vella: “And I am …”

Tony Appleby: “No this is what’s weird, I don’t see if I haven’t told anybody anything.”

Esther Vella: “Well the only way they would have got it because I was stupid and I did a search on suicide.”

And later,

Tony Appleby: “So, so what happened to Peter, he just chickened out, did he?”

Esther Vella: “Yeah.”

Tony Appleby: “That’s basically …”

Esther Vella: “He’s always been a coward so I don’t think much of him in, in a lot of ways.” (emphasis added)


	
	Later Ms Vella and Mr Appleby discuss the finer points of the difference between a conspiracy and a substantive offence:
	


“Vella: …they can’t charge you on a plan.

Appleby: I don’t know.

Vella: You could be writing a novel, you could be writing a book.

Appleby: Oh, O.K., yeah.

Vella: Cause it didn’t happen.

Appleby: You didn’t have it on paper, did you your plan?

Vella: No, but I had bits of scrap, but they already have enough. They had enough evidence.

Appleby: So all the papers that we burnt had stuff on it that could have made it worst?

Vella: That was in my handwriting.

Appleby: In your handwriting?

Vella: (no audible reply)

Appleby: Oh boy. Boy, oh boy, oh boy. Mmm … So probably just as well it got burnt then?

Vella: Yeah.” (emphasis added)


	
	The emphasised portion of the above clearly involves an admission by Ms Vella to the existence of a “plan”.
	
	
	On 31 October 2011 Mr Siskos telephoned Mr Wang and instructed him to cancel the policy. Mr Appleby stated that around this time Ms Vella told him that “Peter’s cancelled his life insurance”. Mr Wang sent OnePath an email on 8 November 2011 requesting cancellation. The policy was cancelled on 9 November 2011. The applicants were arrested on 6 June 2012.
	


Mr Siskos’ evidence


	
	Ms Vella did not give evidence at the trial but Mr Siskos did. He denied entering into any agreement with Ms Vella to commit suicide after the expiry of the exclusion period or having any intention to commit suicide at any point. He said that he had known Ms Vella for nearly twenty five years. At first their relationship was intimate but thereafter it was a “very close friendship”. He said that she had paid for them both to travel to Malta and paid a “few bills, clothing, stuff like that” for which he had received the benefit. He said the cassette recording noted in [58] was made during a meeting they attended with a financial counselling service called “Christians Against Poverty”. He agreed that he stated that he owed Ms Vella $760,000 but that was only because “I didn’t want to have an argument when we had the meeting of who the debt was or where it belonged to or whatever”. He denied making any reference to robbing a bank or killing himself in any conversation as suggested by Ms Shi. Mr Siskos agreed that he asked Mr Wang to have the exclusion period for insurance waived but that was only because he wanted “to get the best value on his policy”. He said that Mr Wang also helped him with making plans for a lawn mowing business.
	
	
	Mr Siskos said that in October 2011 he was travelling to work on the train but decided not to continue because he “had enough”. However, he denied being suicidal and said that he only “wanted to get away”. In cross examination he either denied or did not recall other parts of the Crown case including any knowledge of the “Malta deal”, that Ms Vella said to him in the presence of Mr Appleby that the “Malta money is coming soon, isn’t it”, that after he spoke to the police he told Ms Vella of the evidence that the police had against her or that he cancelled the policy because he knew he could no longer claim on it.
	


Ms Vella’s Conviction Appeal


	
	Ms Vella’s notice of appeal raised seven grounds of appeal against her conviction. Grounds 2 to 5 concerned the conduct of her Counsel at the trial. In light of an affidavit that was filed and read from that Counsel, grounds 2 and 3 were not pressed but the balance were. I will address ground 7 first and the remainder in turn.
	


Ground 7 – Unreasonable Verdict


	
	Ground 7 of the appeal contends that the jury's verdict of guilty was ""unreasonable, or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence"" (Criminal Appeal Act, s 6(1); see MFA v R [2002] HCA 53; 213 CLR 606 at [58]). In raising this ground the appellant implicitly seeks a grant of leave under s 5(1)(b) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 to raise a ground of appeal involving a question of fact or of mixed law and fact (Rasic v R [2009] NSWCCA 202 at [12]).
	
	
	In determining this ground of appeal the Court is required to “ask itself ... whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty” (M v R [1994] HCA 63; 181 CLR 487 at 493) (“M v R”). The Court must undertake its own “independent assessment of the evidence, both as to its sufficiency and its quality” (Morris v R [1987] HCA 50; 163 CLR 454 at 473). The Court must consider any competing evidence to that presented by the Crown and weigh the conflicting evidence (SKA v R [2011] HCA 13; 243 CLR 400 at [24] per French CJ, Gummow and Kiefel JJ).
	
	
	The significance of the advantage enjoyed by the jury in hearing and observing witnesses give their evidence compared to this Court on this ground of appeal was explained in SKA at [13] (per French CJ, Gummow and Kiefel JJ) as follows:
	


""The starting point in the application of s 6(1) is that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, and the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses. However, the joint judgment in M [v R at 494] went on to say:

'In most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced. It is only where a jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a court of criminal appeal that the court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred'.""


	
	In Lee v R  [2013] NSWCCA 68 at [210], Basten JA stressed the need to identify the particular aspects of the verdict (“the complaints”) that were unsafe and the matters said to give rise to the requisite doubt. In this case the written submissions filed on behalf of Ms Vella do not state anything in support of the ground and no oral submissions were directed to this ground. It may be that the mere invocation of the ground triggers an obligation on the Court to assess the sufficiency and quality of all of the evidence independently in order to determine whether or not the requisite doubt exists. I have undertaken that review but the failure to make any meaningful submission in support of the ground means that the assessment has been undertaken in circumstances where there has not been identified any particular issue or item of evidence as warranting particular scrutiny. The balance of Ms Vella’s grounds of appeal do not raise any matter that affects this ground.
	
	
	As noted, the real issue(s) in the trial was whether the Crown established beyond reasonable doubt that, from a time no later than the making of the application to OnePath, Ms Vella and Mr Siskos agreed that Mr Siskos would commit suicide after the expiry of the exclusion period and intended to give effect to that agreement.
	
	
	The evidence that Ms Vella entered into such an agreement and she intended it to be carried into effect was very strong. I have already described the evidence concerning her relationship with Mr Siskos. Both of them attended upon Mr Wang, they both signed the insurance application and the policy was secured over his life in her favour. As noted, Ms Shi overheard a conversation between them in which he referred to killing himself (see [37]). He acknowledged his debt to her in the recorded conversation noted in [38] and appears to have contemplated suicide as a means of satisfying it.
	
	
	Ms Vella’s statements to Ms Shi, Ms Byrne and especially to Mr Appleby are particularly incriminating. Each of those witnesses had little if anything to do with each other and no apparent motive to incriminate Ms Vella, yet their evidence is consistent as to Ms Vella’s plans and intentions. Ms Vella’s repeated references to the “Malta deal”, the stated timing of receipt of funds from that deal, the reference to that deal in a conversation with Mr Siskos ([50]) and her subsequent concession to Mr Appleby that there was no such deal strongly support the Crown’s contention that it was in truth a reference to the funds she expected to receive following Mr Siskos’ suicide. Her actions in destroying evidence only confirm the effect of this evidence.
	
	
	Further, various acts of Mr Siskos that were not undertaken in Ms Vella’s presence were nevertheless admissible against her to prove his participation in the conspiracy (Ahern v R [1988] HCA 39; 165 CLR 87, p 93) (“Ahern”). Those acts included his request to Mr Wang to have the preclusion period waived, his cancellation of the policy in November 2011 and most significantly his actions in disappearing in October 2011 soon after the expiry of the preclusion period. (The jury were instructed that Ms Vella’s statements to Ms Shi and Mr Appleby were not evidence against Mr Siskos of his participation in the conspiracy. In the case of the statements to Ms Shi it appears to have been accepted that these statements were made prior to the conspiracy being formed. It is not clear why the statements made by Ms Vella to Mr Appleby were not evidence against Mr Siskos of his participation: see Ahern at p 100. However it is not necessary to consider this further as it is not relevant to this ground which concerns the case against Ms Vella.)
	
	
	The principal evidence in favour of Ms Vella was that given on oath by Mr Siskos. The trial judge directed the jury that, if there was a reasonable possibility that the version given by Mr Siskos was true, then the Crown case failed. It follows from their verdict that the jury comprehensively rejected that account. To the extent that Mr Siskos’ denial of the Crown case is a matter capable of raising a reasonable doubt before this Court as to Ms Vella’s guilt, it was a doubt of the kind that was capable of being resolved by the advantage conferred on the jury in “seeing and hearing the evidence” of Mr Siskos (cf M v R at 494).
	
	
	The most challenging aspect of the Crown case was whether it established beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Siskos intended to give effect to his agreement with Ms Vella, that is whether he intended to take his own life. Nevertheless there was a powerful body of evidence to support that fact, especially the coincidence in timing between the end of the preclusion period and Mr Siskos’ disappearance. It was “open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt” of that matter and Ms Vella’s guilt generally, notwithstanding Mr Siskos’ denials.
	
	
	I would grant leave to Ms Vella to raise ground 7 but reject it.
	


Ground 1: Admissions of Ms Vella recorded by a Listening Device


	
	Ground 1 of Ms Vella's appeal contends that his Honour erred in directing the jury as follows:
	


“Moreover, the Crown relies upon the admissions made by Esther Vella said to have been made at the time of the disappearance of Peter Siskos. You may recall the evidence of Tony Appleby who stated that Esther Vella informed him after the disappearance of Peter Siskos that there was no Malta money and that Peter had agreed to commit suicide and that they had taken out an insurance policy and she would receive the insurance money and that would cover what he owed her. The Crown also relies on evidence from the listening device recording where she makes admissions about the plan.” (emphasis added)


	
	The written submissions in support of this ground raise the bare contention that this direction was erroneous because the listening device recording does not reveal any admissions. This contention is without foundation. Some of the relevant parts of the conversation recorded by the listening device are set out above at [61] to [62]]. They clearly constitute admissions. Otherwise the direction that was given was favourable to Ms Vella in that his Honour did not isolate what the admissions were. If his Honour had attempted that, it would have been a lengthy process and very damaging to Ms Vella’s case.
	
	
	This ground requires a grant of leave in that it involves a mixed question of law and fact. No complaint was made about this direction at the trial. Rule 4 applies. I would refuse leave to raise this ground.
	


Ground 4: Inferences from the fact that Mr Siskos was still alive


	
	Ground 4 of Ms Vella’s amended grounds of appeal is expressed as follows:
	


“[His Honour] erred in failing to direct the jury that a significant issue in the case was whether or not Mr Peter Siskos had reached an agreement with the Appellant that he was going to commit suicide after the expiration of the thirteen (13) month suicide exclusion clause and that his Honour further erred, in failing to give the jury an inference direction, directing them as to what inferences could be drawn from the fact that Mr Peter Siskos was alive at the time of the hearing.”


	
	The first part of this ground is simply wrong. His Honour did direct the jury to the effect that they had to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Ms Vella and Mr Siskos had reached an agreement that he was going to commit suicide after the expiration of the thirteen month exclusion clause. Thus at one point his Honour told the jury:
	


“A conspiracy is an agreement between two or more persons to do an unlawful act. The nub of the offence is the agreement to engage in a common enterprise to do the unlawful act alleged. In the present case the Crown alleges that the agreement was between the accused Peter Siskos and the accused Esther Vella. The agreement was for the accused Peter Siskos to take out a life insurance policy on the understanding he would subsequently take his own life leaving Esther Vella as the sole beneficiary.

It is the Crown case that this agreement was not disclosed to the insurer OnePath Life Limited.” (emphasis added)


	
	Further, as already noted, in explaining the dishonest means said to have been employed, his Honour referred to an alleged agreement “between themselves [that] the accused Peter Siskos [would] commit suicide after the expiration of the exclusion period leaving the accused Esther Vella as the sole beneficiary”.
	
	
	In relation to the balance of the ground, it is true the trial judge did not specifically advert to Mr Siskos’ status as a living being in his directions to the jury. Given that Mr Siskos was on trial before them and gave evidence over two days, it can safely be assumed that the jury were aware that he was still alive. The self-evident fact that he was alive was not something upon which the jury could draw inferences but was instead an objective fact tending against the jury drawing the inference contended for by the Crown that he entered into the agreement with Ms Vella to end his life after the expiration of the exclusion period. However, the Crown case was that he withdrew from the agreement at the last minute. As against Ms Vella the Crown relied on her apparent agreement with Mr Appleby’s description that “he just chickened out” and her description of him as a “coward” (see [61]). It also relied on Mr Siskos’ conduct in disappearing from work and loitering at train stations in the period after the exclusion period expired. These were all matters for the jury to consider.
	
	
	No specific direction was sought by Counsel for Ms Vella (or Mr Siskos) on the significance of the fact that Mr Siskos was alive at the time of the trial. Any direction on that topic would have been an insult to the jury’s intelligence. Rule 4 applies to this ground. I propose that leave to raise it should be refused.
	


Ground 5: Failure to lead character evidence


	
	Ground 5 of Ms Vella’s Amended Grounds of Appeal contends that:
	


“… [Ms Vella] experienced a miscarriage of justice by reason of flagrantly incompetent legal representation, which resulted in the Jury being unaware that neither she nor Mr Siskos had any criminal convictions for approximately thirty (30) years and/or was a person of good character.”


	
	Prior to the close of the Crown case the trial judge raised with each of Counsel for Ms Vella and Mr Siskos whether they were seeking a direction concerning their client’s supposedly good character. Each of them advised that they were not. Ms Vella’s only prior convictions were in Western Australia in 1978 when she was convicted of three counts of stealing and fined $25, $10 and $20 respectively. Ms Vella was nineteen years old when she was convicted of those offences and was fifty-four years old at the time of her trial. The form of character evidence that it was contended should have been adduced was asking the officer in charge of the investigation to agree with the proposition that Ms Vella “had no prior criminal history extending over a period of thirty-five (35) years and that her only criminal conviction was for a minor matter, approximately thirty-five (35) years ago”. Mr Siskos’ prior convictions are outlined below at [134].
	
	
	In assessing complaints about the conduct of Counsel, the relevant inquiry is whether what occurred or did not occur at the trial occasioned a miscarriage of justice (TKWJ v R [2002] HCA 46; 212 CLR 124 at [79] per McHugh J, Ali v R [2005] HCA 8; 214 ALR 1 at [18] per Hayne J). This involves a consideration of what did or did not occur at the trial, whether there was some material irregularity in the trial and whether there is a significant possibility that the acts or omissions of which complaint is made affected the outcome of the trial (Nudd v R [2006] HCA 9, 80 ALJR 614 (“Nudd”) at [24] per Gummow and Hayne JJ; TKWJ at [31]-[33] per Gaudron J, at [79] and [97] per McHugh J at [101], per Gummow J and at [103]-[108] per Hayne J).
	
	
	The ground of appeal contends that trial Counsel’s conduct displayed “flagrant incompetence” by his failure to lead character evidence concerning Ms Vella and Mr Siskos. The phrase “flagrant incompetence” is sometimes used to describe the level of departure from the standard expected by Counsel for an accused person that must be shown before a miscarriage of justice will arise (see R v Birks (1990) 19 NSWLR 677, 685; Ahmu v R; Director of Public Prosecutions v Ahmu [2014] NSWCCA 312 at [30] per Basten JA). However, in Nudd at [16] Gleeson CJ explained that “flagrant incompetence” is not a substitute for the statutory test of a miscarriage of justice and is perhaps best understood as a reference to “conduct incapable of rational explanation on forensic grounds”.
	
	
	In any event an accusation of such conduct is a serious matter to raise against a non-party to an appeal and it should not be made without detailed consideration of at least the material available to trial Counsel, the instructions they received and the issues in the trial. In this case the allegation of “flagrant incompetence” appears to have been made by simply noting that both applicants only had relatively minor convictions from many years previously, contending that such convictions could be “explained away”, and then asserting that it was therefore inexplicable that character evidence was not called.
	
	
	As further explained below, trial Counsel for Ms Vella swore an affidavit identifying a range of material in addition to her previous convictions that was potentially available to the Crown to be deployed to destroy an assertion that she was of good character. It is not known whether Ms Vella’s current legal representatives made any attempts to seek an explanation from that Counsel or Ms Vella’s former solicitor about these matters before making an accusation of “flagrant incompetence”, but that would have been advisable. However, leaving that aside, they could have asked their client about this matter given that the undisputed evidence is that the subject of adducing evidence of her good character was discussed with her during the trial, and that discussion addressed the possibility of the Crown deploying material to demonstrate she was dishonest in her financial affairs.
	
	
	In Matthews v R [2013] NSWCCA 187 at [63] this Court identified four matters relevant to the inquiry into whether the conduct of Counsel has occasioned a miscarriage of justice namely:
	


“First, there is vested in counsel for an accused person control over and responsibility for the manner in which the trial will be conducted (TKWJ at [74] per McHugh J). Second, relevant unfairness will not be established simply because an ‘apparently rational decision’ by trial counsel produced adverse consequences for the accused (TKWJ at [16] per Gleeson CJ). Third, inquiries into the subjective thought processes of counsel for taking the steps they did at the trial are to be avoided. Instead the question is whether there could be a reasonable explanation for the course that was adopted at trial (Ali per Hayne J, with whom Gummow J agreed at [25]; TKWJ at [110] per Hayne J). If there could be such an explanation then no error or defect in the trial occasioning any miscarriage of justice is shown to have occurred (Ali id). Fourth, although the inquiry into whether there was an explanation for counsel's conduct is an objective one, there are some perhaps limited circumstances in which it is necessary for the appeal court to be apprised of material such as counsel's instructions (Nudd at [10] and [17] per Gleeson CJ).”


	
	The interaction of the third and fourth principles leaves some scope for uncertainty as to the extent to which evidence from an appellant’s former Counsel and solicitor explaining their conduct can be received and considered in determining a complaint that a miscarriage of justice arose from it (see Ahmu at [31] per Basten JA and at [53] per Adams J ). In Nudd Gleeson CJ stressed that so “far as justice permits, the enquiry should be objective” (at [10]) but added “there may be circumstances where it is relevant to ask why some act or omission occurred” (at [10]). One example that his Honour identified was a determination of whether “counsel took a certain course upon the instructions of the client” (id).
	
	
	As noted, an affidavit from trial Counsel for Ms Vella at trial was read on the appeal. The affidavit was read without objection. The affidavit addresses in detail the course taken by Counsel in relation to the decision whether or not to adduce character evidence. In substance the affidavit has three components.
	
	
	First, as has already been adverted to, Counsel identified various items of evidence that were potentially available to the Crown to raise in response to any case on good character raised by Ms Vella. The receipt and consideration of this evidence by this Court is clearly consistent with Nudd. It provides a proper basis for the Court to make an objective assessment of this aspect of the trial. The usual materials provided to the Court on an appeal do not extend to material that was included in the Crown brief or produced to the Court on subpoena but not tendered at the trial.
	
	
	Second, trial Counsel recounts the instructions he received from Ms Vella both on the issue of whether evidence of her good character would be raised and in explanation of the material that was potentially adverse to her character. Consistent with Nudd at [10] and [17] this material can clearly be received and considered. Counsel stated that the question of raising character was discussed with Ms Vella and she agreed that it would not be raised. This evidence was not disputed.
	
	
	Third, trial Counsel provides his recollection of his assessment of the likely strength of the evidence available to the Crown to rebut evidence of Ms Vella’s good character. Consistent with Nudd, a consideration of such assessments should be avoided so “far as justice permits” (Nudd at [10]). In light of the material falling within the first two components of Counsel’s affidavit it is not necessary to consider this aspect of the affidavit further.
	
	
	In relation to the first component Counsel’s affidavit stated that included in the Crown brief was a statement from one of the tenants of one of Ms Vella’s properties alleging that Ms Vella had incurred a debt of $1,300 on her credit card without her consent. At the hearing of this appeal Senior Counsel for Ms Vella conceded that this material went “squarely to [his] client’s honesty”.
	
	
	Further, the material tendered at the trial was capable of suggesting that Ms Vella was not declaring all her income to the taxation authorities. Tendered as part of the Crown case were her notices of assessment for, inter alia, the financial year ended 30 June 2009. It recorded that her declared taxable income for that year was $27,990. In the client questionnaire that she filled out at Mr Wang’s request Ms Vella stated that her teaching income for the financial year was $27,880.00 and investment income was $50,000. This latter figure was consistent with evidence from Ms Kodrun that she paid $300 in cash direct to Ms Vella directly each week for rent at the Cabarita premises and Ms Woodward’s evidence that she was collecting rent for the Cabarita premises and from the Strathfield premises of up to $2,800 per week. Mr Siskos estimated that the rent received from the Strathfield property was “about nine hundred, a thousand dollars a week”. Allowing for deductions for expenses these figures are reconcilable with the estimate of $50,000 for net investment income. However this only reinforces the discrepancy between the taxable income and the income estimate provided to Mr Wang. In his affidavit, Ms  Vella’s trial Counsel recounted that Ms Vella was not able to explain the discrepancies in her financial records and affairs generally.
	
	
	At the hearing of this appeal Senior Counsel for Ms Vella contended that none of this material “really come to anything of any substance” in the absence of any records about how much rent was paid. I disagree. There was a blatant inconsistency between Ms Vella’s assessed income and the income she disclosed in the insurance questionnaire. This inconsistency was capable of supporting a submission that she was understating her income to the taxation authorities. The evidence of the cash she received for rent was at the very least capable of supporting that submission. The opportunity to make that submission may have arisen if there had been an attempt to adduce evidence of Ms Vella’s supposed good character.
	
	
	Also included in Counsel’s brief was a letter from Ms Vella to the Commonwealth Bank in which she outlined how she had withdrawn over $66,000 from a self-managed superannuation fund in the joint names of herself and Mr Siskos for her personal expenses. This appears to have been an improper use of superannuation funds and, more importantly, a partial appropriation by her of funds of Mr Siskos. Ms Vella’s trial Counsel was unaware of whether the Crown possessed the letter but for the purposes of the present inquiry its potential availability to the Crown is more than sufficient to lead to the conclusion that no miscarriage of justice was occasioned by not leading such evidence as there was of Ms Vella’s good character.
	
	
	Ms Vella’s trial Counsel also identified other material in the Crown brief which indicated that Ms Vella was manipulative and prone to expend sums available to her by others on personal expenditure. In the context of a Crown case that alleged she manipulated Mr Siskos to agree to kill himself to secure a payment of his life insurance policy, this material was potentially very damaging.
	
	
	It follows that, if Ms Vella had attempted to raise evidence of her good character in the form of her lack of criminal convictions since her late teenage years, then there was a real potential for the Crown to deploy material that was capable of demonstrating that she was dishonest in financial matters. At the very least this could have led to a distracting and potentially damaging inquiry into her conduct on a number of fronts. As she did not give evidence, the only benefit to her from raising character was the provision of a direction to the jury to the effect that, if they considered her to be of good character, then they should take that into account in assessing the likelihood that she committed the offences with which she was charged. The benefit of that direction was very likely to be outweighed by the cost incurred by an inquiry into her character. No miscarriage of justice was occasioned by the failure to raise character evidence.
	
	
	The written submissions in support of this ground of appeal also contend that Ms Vella’s trial Counsel displayed “flagrant incompetence” in not adducing evidence of the good character of Mr Siskos. Mr Siskos’ position is addressed below. However the contention that one Counsel in a joint trial displays incompetence in not adducing character evidence concerning their client’s co-accused in the face of an apparently considered decision by that person’s Counsel not to lead such evidence is baseless. Leaving aside all other considerations, the opening up of unnecessary divisions between the cases for the two accused has a tendency to damage both cases.
	
	
	As this ground does not purely raise a question of law, leave is required to raise it. I propose that leave to raise ground 5 be granted but would reject the ground.
	


Ground 6: the “additional evidence” of Ms Henriette Scheepers


	
	Ground 6 of Ms Vella’s amended grounds of appeal is expressed as follows:
	


“[His Honour] erred in allowing the additional evidence to be called from Ms Henriette Scheepers, that was not included in her statement made to the Police, in circumstances where Counsel for [the Appellant] and Counsel for Mr Peter Siskos sought a direction that the Jury be discharged in the absence of expert evidence in their own cases to meet this new additional evidence.”


	
	As noted, Ms Scheepers was employed as a senior underwriter by OnePath. She was called on the sixth day of the trial. Ms Scheepers stated that she assessed the application for a policy relating to Mr Siskos and Ms Vella and determined to approve both policies on behalf of OnePath. The “additional evidence” to which this ground of appeal is directed is the following part of her evidence in chief:
	


““Q.  And can I ask you this, if information had been provided to you that a person had the intention of committing suicide, would you grant a policy if you received that information?

A.  If you receive a risk that looks like if it’s a risk for us of suicidal risk, we don’t offer cover at all.

Q.  And if you were informed that a person did in fact intend to terminate their life would you grant a policy?

A.  No because it would fall into that group that we don’t offer cover.

Q.  And was that the position back in 2010?

A.  Yes it was and it still is.”


	
	It is necessary to outline how this additional evidence came to be adduced. A statement from Ms Scheepers was served in advance of the trial but it did not include the additional evidence. At some point after the trial commenced the Crown advised that it proposed to adduce the additional evidence. On the fifth day of the trial the trial advocate appearing for the Crown advised his Honour that there was objection to the additional evidence being adduced.
	
	
	Counsel for Ms Vella did not initially raise any objection. Instead he noted from a “purely precautionary … point of view” he wanted to know what the evidence was and reassurance as to Ms Scheepers’ “authority” to say it. However, trial counsel for Mr Siskos submitted that the “evidence ought not be allowed and in the alternate it if it is to be allowed before it is allowed, my application is for the matter to be adjourned, perhaps necessarily with the discharge of the jury”. He submitted that the adducing of the additional evidence meant that there was a necessity to obtain a “suitable expert … opinion” because:
	


“… it is not simply a matter of what [Ms Scheepers] might post fact assume the position to be, as opposed to a diligent exploration of the Insurance Contracts Act, the duty of disclosure what might reasonably be within contemplation of an insurer and the interplay of a policy that provides specifically for a risk, the unusual risk of death caused by intentional act, when there is a preclusion period …”.


	
	Ms Scheepers was called to give evidence on a voir dire. In chief she gave the additional evidence. Under cross examination by Counsel for Ms Vella, Ms Scheepers was generally castigated for her unfamiliarity with the Insurance Contracts Act 1984 and for not considering its requirements before giving her evidence as to what she would have done had the intention of Mr Siskos been disclosed prior to the life insurance policy being written. This questioning continued despite her having stated at the outset that she was only explaining her approach to underwriting and not addressing the different issue as to the avoidance of a policy on the basis of a fraudulent non-disclosure or the refusal of a fraudulent claim:
	


“Q.  So you are not saying that you would have not entered into, OnePath would not have entered into the policy on the basis of fraud by failing to disclose, is that right?

A.  That’s how the claims people will assess. I can’t make a definite comment on that, I’m not a claim assessor, I’m on the underwriting side when they’re entering the contract.” (emphasis added)


	
	After Ms Scheepers’ evidence on the voir dire concluded, Counsel for Mr Siskos contended that notification that the additional evidence of Ms Scheepers would be adduced was given too late and that meant that his client was “precluded from [taking up] the opportunity in a timely way to obtain independent expert opinion as to how these decisions are arrived at”. Counsel for Ms Vella supported that position. He contended that Ms Scheepers’ evidence was “broadly unsatisfactory” because of the “contractual nature of the issues” which were said to be beyond Ms Scheepers’ “contemplation” and knowledge.
	
	
	The trial judge gave short ex tempore reasons allowing the Crown’s application to adduce the evidence. His Honour noted that both Counsel had applied for an adjournment to adduce expert evidence in response to the additional evidence of Ms Scheepers and, if granted, that this would necessitate a discharge of the jury. His Honour noted the submission of Counsel for Mr Siskos as to whether there was a duty on the part of Mr Siskos to disclose “an agreement to commit suicide” and that there was an issue as to whether the exclusion period of thirteen months “exists to deal with such contingencies”. However his Honour (correctly) noted that Ms Scheepers was not giving evidence as to the extent of Mr Siskos’ duty of disclosure but only “whether the policy would have been approved on a commercial basis”. His Honour continued:
	


“The question of whether the applicant had a duty to disclose the agreement to terminate his life is not sought to be answered by this witness by the Crown. Moreover it would appear not only to be outside her area of expertise but also not part of the decision as to whether to approve or not approve a policy. I would note at the commencement of the policy itself, a duty of disclosure warning that clearly states the duty includes any matter which is relevant to the insurer’s decisions. Whether the exclusion period renders the obligation no longer applicable is not evidence sought to be adduced from this witness.

The reasons advanced for an adjournment in my view [do] not arise in relation to this evidence. The application for adjournment is also refused. I should add it follows the Crown may not adduce evidence from this witness as to whether or not the accused had a duty to disclose an agreement to terminate his life.”


	
	On behalf of Ms Vella three points were raised in support of the contention that his Honour erred in allowing the Crown to adduce the additional evidence. The first is that the subject matter of Ms Scheepers’ evidence was said to be a “matter of expert opinion”, yet she was not shown to be an appropriately qualified expert. Second it was submitted that his Honour erred in not addressing various provisions of the Insurance Contracts Act said to be relevant to her evidence and whether it should be adduced. Third it was contended that the late adducing of the evidence was in breach of the Crown’s duty of disclosure and this warranted its exclusion.
	
	
	In relation to the first contention, it was not submitted to his Honour that Ms Scheepers’ evidence was opinion evidence based on specialised knowledge within the meaning of s 79 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) and it should be rejected because she was not appropriately qualified. Instead it was submitted to his Honour that to respond to it each of the accused needed to obtain expert evidence and that necessitated both an adjournment of the trial and a discharge of the jury. His Honour rejected that contention because his Honour (correctly) concluded that the submission was based on a misconception that Ms Scheepers’ additional evidence was directed to the extent of Mr Siskos’ duty to disclose his intention to commit suicide, and the remedies available to OnePath if it issued a policy based on a non-disclosure of that matter. Instead his Honour found that the additional evidence concerned OnePath’s decision to enter into a policy in the first place. Thus his Honour concluded that the “reasons advanced for the adjournment”, namely the necessity to obtain expert evidence, did not “arise in relation to this evidence”.
	
	
	In any event the additional evidence of Ms Scheepers was not “opinion evidence” and thus no question of whether it was sufficiently based on any specialised knowledge of Ms Scheepers within the meaning of s 79 of the Evidence Act arose.
	
	
	Section 79 operates as an exception to the “opinion rule” in s 76 which precludes evidence of an opinion being admissible to “prove the existence of a fact about the existence of which the opinion was expressed”. A number of decisions have held that a statement by a witness of what they would have done in a hypothetical situation is not opinion evidence. In Allstate Life Insurance Co v Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (No 5) (1996) 64 FCR 73 (“Allstate”) Lindgren J held that evidence from a witness stating what would have been the effect on a recommendation he made relating to an investment had he known certain details about certain liabilities arising under guarantees was not opinion evidence. His Honour noted that “opinion” was not defined in the Evidence Act but in “the context of the general law of evidence, ‘opinion’ has been defined as ‘an inference from observed and communicable data’” and this form of evidence was not of that character (at pp 75–76).
	
	
	Allstate was followed by Finn J in Hughes Aircraft Systems International v Airservices Australia (No. 3) (1997) 80 FCR 276, and by the Full Federal Court in Fitness Australia Ltd v Copyright Tribunal [2010] FCAFC 148 at [65] and La Trobe Capital & Mortgage Corp Limited v Hay Property Consultants Pty Ltd [2011] FCAFC 4 at [53] to [58] per Finkelstein J with whom Jacobson and Besanko JJ agreed (“La Trobe”). In La Trobe at [57] Finkelstein J extended Allstate to a witness with appropriate authority testifying to what their corporate employer would have done in a hypothetical set of circumstances.
	
	
	The reasoning in Allstate was also approved by the Court of Appeal in Seltsam Pty Ltd v McNeill [2006] NSWCA 158 at [118] to [123] per Bryson JA (with whom Handley and Tobias JA agreed). At [123] his Honour concluded:
	


“At the heart of the controversy, I do not find it possible to see evidence given by a person about his state of mind, in an actual or hypothetical situation, as an opinion. The state of a person's mind is a fact and remains a fact whether what is under the discussion is an actual state of mind, or the state in which a person's mind would be in some contingency which has not happened.”


	
	In oral submissions in this Court Senior Counsel for Ms Vella submitted that Allstate and the line of cases that has followed it can be distinguished because they were concerned with “reliance”, that is with one party to civil litigation seeking to establish what would have occurred had some fact or matter been disclosed to it or some other entity in the course of a commercial transaction and the issues in this case were different. However in this case the additional evidence of Ms Scheepers was adduced by the Crown to demonstrate a form of “reliance” on the part of OnePath as part of proving the alternative count of obtaining a benefit by deception. To prove that a benefit was obtained it was necessary to demonstrate that each of Ms Vella and Mr Siskos in fact “obtained a financial advantage” based on their false representation that they had applied for an insurance policy in “good faith”. To do so the Crown had to demonstrate, inter alia, that had they disclosed Mr Siskos’ intention to commit suicide then no policy would have been written.
	
	
	However it was not an essential part of the Crown case on count 1 that it demonstrate that, had OnePath been told that Mr Siskos intended to commit suicide, it would not have underwritten a policy over his life. As has been explained, the underlying premise of the Crown case was that the agreement of the two applicants not to disclose Mr Siskos’ intention to commit suicide to OnePath was dishonest because both accused knew that they were obliged to disclose that to OnePath. Ms Scheepers’ evidence appears to have little, if any, relevance to that issue. As noted at [28], at least by the end of the trial it was not a live issue.
	
	
	The second contention noted in [114] can be dealt with briefly. During argument before the trial judge reference was made to provisions of the Insurance Contracts Act dealing with an insured’s obligations of disclosure and regulating an insurer’s right to avoid a policy on the basis of a non-disclosure by or on behalf of the insured. The written submissions in this court identified the relevant provisions as ss 21, 54, 55 and 55A which respectively concern the insured’s duty of disclosure, restrict the circumstances in which an insurer can refuse to pay claims, specify that an insurer has no additional rights in respect of claims to those regulated by s 54, and confer standing on the Australian Securities Investment Commission to bring proceedings in respect of breaches of the Act.
	
	
	In his judgment permitting the Crown to adduce the additional evidence , his Honour referred to the “legislative framework of insurance contracts” but did not address the specific provisions. His Honour was not obliged to do so. To the contrary his Honour correctly recognised that those provisions were irrelevant because they were invoked as part of a submission that incorrectly characterised Ms Scheepers’ additional evidence as addressing the insured’s duty of disclosure and an insurer’s remedies if that duty was breached. Nothing in the Insurance Contracts Act, including the provisions referred to in this Court, affected OnePath’s underwriting decision about whether cover was to first be offered to a person who disclosed their intention to commit suicide. Those provisions are only engaged if an insurance contract was entered into, a claim was subsequently made and the insurer sought to avoid the policy on the basis of an alleged non-disclosure, (ss 21 and 29) or possibly deny the claim on the basis of some act or omission of the insured or another person (s 54). They are predicated on the existence of an insurance contract, whereas Ms Scheepers’ evidence concerned whether such a contract would have come into existence had Mr Siskos’ intentions been disclosed.
	
	
	The third contention noted in [114] in effect complains about the exercise of his Honour’s discretion to allow the adducing of this evidence without it being previously notified. It seems that in considering whether or not to refuse to admit the additional evidence and whether or not to adjourn the trial his Honour was considering the exercise of the discretionary powers conferred by ss 146(1) and (3) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 which respectively provide:
	


“146 Sanctions for non-compliance with pre-trial disclosure requirements

(1)   Exclusion of evidence not disclosed

   The court may refuse to admit evidence in proceedings that is sought to be adduced by a party who failed to disclose the evidence to the other party in accordance with requirements for pre-trial disclosure imposed by or under this Division.

…

(3)   Adjournment

   The court may grant an adjournment to a party if the other party seeks to adduce evidence in the proceedings that the other party failed to disclose in accordance with requirements for pre-trial disclosure imposed by or under this Division and that would prejudice the case of the party seeking the adjournment.”


	
	The premise of the argument in this Court was that because Ms Scheepers’ statement did not contain the additional evidence there had been a non-compliance with s 142(1)(c) of the Criminal Procedure Act in that there had not been, in substance, service of a “copy of a statement of each witness whose evidence the prosecutor proposes to adduce at the trial”. For the purposes of dealing with this ground of appeal I will accept that premise.
	
	
	The written submissions in support of this aspect of ground 6 did not identify any error of the kind identified by House v R [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499 at 505 in the exercise of his Honour’s discretion. One part of the submissions appeared to assert that the prosecution deliberately failed to notify each of the applicants of its intention to adduce the additional evidence (the “prosecution chose not to disclose”). If material was deliberately withheld from the defence and then produced late then that would be a matter relevant to the exercise of the powers conferred by s 146(1) and (3). However no such contention was made, much less substantiated, before the trial judge. It follows that there was no error on his Honour’s part in failing to address such a contention. Instead the matter proceeded on the basis that the failure was inadvertent in the sense that the Crown overlooked the necessity to obtain such evidence (which is not surprising given that count 2 was only added to the indictment just prior to the trial commencing).
	
	
	In oral submissions in this Court, Senior Counsel for Ms Vella submitted that the late notice of the fact that the evidence would be adduced prevented the taking of a “number of interrogatory steps” including subpoenaing OnePath and “obtain[ing] other evidence from people in the trade”. The prejudice occasioned to the accused by a late notification of an intention to adduce evidence is undoubtedly a matter to be considered in the exercise of the powers conferred by s 146(1) and (3). However the suggestion that expert evidence needed to be obtained was made to his Honour and correctly rejected. As stated it was based on an incorrect characterisation of the nature and effect of Ms Scheepers’ evidence. Otherwise one means of challenging Ms Scheepers’ additional evidence would have been to subpoena OnePath’s underwriting file or underwriting guidelines. However no submission that the applicants were prevented from doing so was made to the trial judge and it follows that his Honour did not err by failing to address it. If it had been made I expect his Honour would have accommodated it by allowing short service of a subpoena although it is not necessary to consider this further. No error affecting the exercise of his Honour’s discretion to allow the additional evidence of Ms Scheepers has been demonstrated.
	
	
	As this ground is not purely a question of law, leave is required to raise it. I propose that leave to raise ground 6 be granted but would reject the ground.
	


Conclusion on Ms Vella’s conviction appeal


	
	It follows that I would dismiss Ms Vella’s appeal against her conviction.
	


Conviction appeal – Mr Siskos


	
	Three grounds of appeal are raised in support of Mr Siskos’ application for leave to appeal from his conviction. He does not contend that his conviction was unsafe or unsatisfactory.
	
	
	Ground 1 of Mr Siskos’ appeal is the same as ground 4 of Ms Vella’s conviction appeal. No submissions of any substance beyond those addressed above were made in support of this ground. I would refuse leave to raise it for the reasons already given.
	
	
	Ground 2 of the appeal is similar to ground 5 of Ms Vella’s appeal namely that “he experienced a miscarriage of justice by reason of flagrantly incompetent legal representation which resulted in the jury being unaware that [Mr Siskos] had any criminal convictions for approximately thirty (30) years and/or was a person of good character.”
	
	
	The relevant principles applicable to the determination of such a complaint are set out at [89] to [94].
	
	
	The written submissions in support of this ground contend that it “is difficult to imagine what ‘tactical purpose’ could have been served” by trial Counsel for Mr Siskos not adducing evidence that “the Appellant had any criminal convictions for thirty (30) years” or “lay evidence as to his character”. The lay evidence that could have been adduced is not identified. It is true that by the time of the trial Mr Siskos has not been convicted of any offence for 28 years. However, the complete position was that in April 1981 Mr Siskos was convicted of illegally using a motor vehicle and two counts of stealing. He was fined and given a recognizance under former s 558 of the Crimes Act. In September 1982 he was convicted of two charges of malicious injury and fined. Between 1983 and 1985 he received a number of convictions for traffic offences and possession of Indian hemp. Fines were imposed for all these offences.
	
	
	As was the case with Ms Vella’s appeal an affidavit was read from trial Counsel for Mr Siskos as well as from the solicitor instructing at the trial. I have treated those affidavits in a manner consistent with the approach stated in [94] to [98]. One matter outlined in trial Counsel for Ms Siskos’ affidavit is that prior to the trial he emailed the Crown Prosecutor inquiring, inter alia, as to whether, if good character was sought to be raised, the Crown would seek to rely on Mr Siskos’ criminal record. At or about the commencement of the trial the Crown Prosecutor confirmed that the Crown would seek to rely on those convictions. In my view this aspect of the affidavit is a matter that regard can and should be had to in determining this ground of appeal.
	
	
	As noted, Mr Siskos gave evidence. Clearly whether or not the jury accepted his evidence was crucial to his chances of an acquittal. The prospect of his being questioned in relation to convictions including theft and illegal use of a motor vehicle had the real potential to adversely affect his credit before the jury and distract its attention from evaluating his denials of the critical parts of the Crown case. That conclusion is sufficient to warrant the conclusion that no miscarriage of justice was occasioned by the “failure” of his trial Counsel to adduce evidence that he had not received any convictions in the 28 years prior to the trial.
	
	
	I propose that leave to raise this ground be granted but the ground be rejected.
	
	
	Ground 3 of the appeal is the same as ground 6 of Ms Vella’s appeal against her conviction. No submissions of any substance beyond those addressed above were made in support of this ground. For the reasons already given I propose that leave to raise the ground be granted but the ground be rejected.
	


Conclusion on Mr Siskos’ conviction appeal


	
	It follows that I would dismiss Mr Siskos’ appeal against his conviction.
	


Sentence appeals – the Sentencing Judgment


	
	In the sentencing judgment his Honour described the facts surrounding the conspiracy in a manner consistent with what is set out above. His Honour then addressed the balance of the sentencing exercise as follows.
	
	
	First, his Honour addressed the subjective circumstances of Ms Vella, some of which have already been noted. A pre-sentence report described Ms Vella's childhood history as ""characterised by loneliness and apparent abandonment"". Ms Vella was refused bail following her conviction. The report stated that while in custody Ms Vella had been “frightened” and experienced “difficulty adjusting to her situation”. His Honour noted and accepted a psychologist's report which described her as being ""dramatic, histrionic and focussed on her own sufferings and injustices"". The report also described her as having a ""history of intermittent periods of depression"" and that she was “currently experiencing ongoing difficulties” with depression, and “had problematic symptoms of stress and anxiety”.
	
	
	Second, his Honour described Mr Siskos’ personal circumstances. Mr Siskos remained on bail after his conviction and prior to sentence. His Honour noted that he had continued to work at the boarding house collecting rent on behalf of Ms Vella, and assisting lodgers. His Honour noted his work history, which included the period as a security officer as well as a store person. His Honour referred to him as experiencing anxiety, depression and noted that he was currently in the care of a psychologist. A psychologist’s report was tendered on his behalf. His Honour noted that the report did not suggest that the relationship between Mr Siskos and Ms Vella was “a harmful, co-dependent relationship” and referred to Mr Siskos as having a “positive and stable sense of worth”. In view of the evidence at the trial, his Honour described the findings of the report as “somewhat surprising”.
	
	
	Third, his Honour noted that in sentencing for a conspiracy to commit a (single) offence it was appropriate to have regard to the statutory maximum for that offence (see The Queen v Hoar [1981] HCA 67; 148 CLR 32 at 39). The maximum penalty for the offence of fraud in s 192E of the Crimes Act 1900 is ten years imprisonment.
	
	
	Fourth, his Honour addressed the seriousness of the offence. His Honour noted that the “motive for committing the offences was one of greed” and contrasted that with a motive of “need”. His Honour also noted that the offence “occurred over a relatively long period of time and there is evidence of the degree of planning involved as opposed to an impulsive offence”. His Honour concluded as follows:
	


“Notwithstanding the fact that no loss was suffered, the offence was objectively serious given the degree of planning, the amount of money involved, the motive for the conspiracy being one of greed, and the nature of the agreement itself, that being one of the conspirators would take his own life necessarily must lead to the conclusion that the offence is objectively very serious and more towards the higher end of the scale for offences of this type.”


	
	This characterisation of the seriousness of the offence is the subject of complaint by both Ms Vella and Mr Siskos.
	
	
	Fifth, his Honour also addressed the role of each offender. His Honour accepted that Ms Vella had “the ascendancy in the relationship and was the primary driving force in the conspiracy” and that Mr Siskos “was acting in order to please [Ms] Vella”. His Honour found that there was “overwhelming evidence that Ms Vella exerted considerable control over Peter Siskos over many years”. His Honour concluded that:
	


“… while [Ms Vella] was to be the sole beneficiary of the agreement, [Mr Siskos’] fate was to end his own life. Whilst her desire was to enrich herself, he expressed feelings consistent with accepting her view that he acted as a weight upon her.”


	
	Further, his Honour found that a significant fact in the conspiracy being discovered was Mr Siskos’ decision “not to proceed with his suicide or his prolonged hesitation in doing so”), while Ms Vella “displayed no such hesitation”. His Honour contrasted the unravelling of this conspiracy with the situation where co-conspirators voluntarily agree to end their agreement.
	
	
	Sixth, although his Honour accepted that the case, especially so far as it concerned Mr Siskos, was “extremely unusual”, his Honour found that his lack of remorse and the objective seriousness of the offence warranted a conclusion that the only sentence that could be imposed upon him was full time imprisonment.
	
	
	Seventh, his Honour found that, given each of their relatively minor criminal records, their personal circumstances and their need for ongoing counselling upon their release, a finding of special circumstances was warranted. In the case of Ms Vella his Honour stated that the reduction in non-parole period would be ""modest"" because of the “length of the sentence and the need to ensure that the non-parole period adequately reflect[ed] the seriousness of the offence” as well the need to address ""specific and general deterrence"". This aspect of the sentencing judgment is the subject of ground 4 of Ms Vella's application for leave to appeal against her sentence.
	


Ms Vella’s application for leave to appeal against sentence


	
	Five grounds are advanced in support of Ms Vella’s application for leave to appeal her sentence.
	


Grounds 1 and 5: Objective Seriousness of the Offence


	
	Grounds 1 and 5 concern his Honour’s finding as to the seriousness of the offence. Ground 1 contends that his Honour erred in finding that the offence was “more towards the higher end of offences of this type”, and erred in concluding that the offence “occurred over a relatively long period of time”.
	
	
	The written submissions in support of this ground focus on his finding that the offence “occurred over a relatively long period of time” (see [144]). The written submissions assert that the Crown’s case was that the “commencement or the beginning of the plan” was in approximately February to March 2010, being the time at which Ms Vella made her statement to Ms Shi noted in [38] above. The submissions then note that “on one view of the facts, the act of conspiracy was complete by the time the policy … was issued on 11 August 2010” with the consequence that the duration of the offence was “something in the vicinity of six months meaning that the offence did not occur over a relatively long period of time”.
	
	
	These submissions identify both a wrong starting point and end point of the offending by Ms Vella. It was a necessary component of the Crown case that the agreement the subject of the conspiracy was formed no later than when Ms Vella and Mr Siskos attended upon Mr Wang in late June 2010 (although it could have been earlier). It was also the Crown case that each of them continued to adhere to that agreement until the time that Mr Siskos failed to attend work in October 2011, being shortly after a conversation between him and Ms Vella about obtaining the Malta money which was owed to her by Mr Appleby (see [50]). The Crown case was put to the jury in those terms and his Honour was correct to sentence Ms Vella on that basis.
	
	
	While the conspiracy was completed by the time of the application for the policy, the offending continued for so long as each of Ms Vella and Mr Siskos continued to adhere to their agreement (Agius v R [2013] HCA 27; 248 CLR 601 at [30]). The period from June 2010 to October 2011 is sufficiently long to answer the description given by his Honour, namely a “relatively long period of time”.
	
	
	I would reject ground 1 of Ms Vella’s application for leave to appeal against her sentence.
	
	
	Ground 5 contends that the sentencing judge erred in finding that the offence was objectively serious in that, inter alia, one of the conspirators would “take his own life” and was therefore, “towards the higher end of the scale of offences of this type”. It asserts that this was “an error of law made in circumstances where suicide is no longer a criminal offence and does not attract any criminal sanction”.
	
	
	The written submissions in support of this ground make no reference to the particular complaint referred to in the ground, namely that suicide is no longer a criminal offence. In any event, that aspect of the complaint has no substance. As explained above, to convict Ms Vella and Mr Siskos of a conspiracy to defraud, the jury had to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that they entered the relevant agreement and that they intended to give effect to it. In this case that meant that the jury were satisfied that they intended to give effect to an agreement pursuant to which Mr Siskos would take his own life. A consideration of the objective seriousness of a conspiracy to defraud includes a consideration of the dishonest means employed. The dishonest means by which this conspiracy was to be effected included, at least so far as Ms Vella was concerned, a form of cruel exploitation of Mr Siskos by her.
	
	
	The written submissions in support of this ground attack so much of his Honour’s assessment of the overall seriousness of the offence that relates to the duration of the conspiracy, a matter that has already been addressed. They also point out that no defrauding in fact occurred. The passage noted in [144] above reveals that his Honour was cognisant of that but noted that only came about because Mr Siskos hesitated in giving effect to their agreement.
	
	
	No error has been demonstrated in relation to his Honour’s assessment of the seriousness of the offence. I would reject ground 5.
	


Ground 4: Special Circumstances


	
	Ground 4 of Ms Vella’s application for leave to appeal against her sentence contends that his Honour erred in that, having found special circumstances, his Honour only applied a “modest” reduction in the non-parole period, being a period of one month.
	
	
	The reasoning of the sentencing judge in respect of special circumstances is described in [149]. This ground of appeal wrongly asserts that in giving effect to this finding his Honour only reduced the non-period by a period of one month. The total sentence imposed by his Honour was six and a half years, that is seventy-eight months, and the non-parole period was four years and three months, that is fifty-one months. If his Honour had not made a finding of special circumstances, then the minimum non-parole period that could have been imposed upon Ms Vella was fifty-eight and a half months, being three-quarters of seventy-eight months: Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (the “Sentencing Act”); s 44(2). Otherwise, his Honour’s reference to other sentencing criteria in fixing a non-parole period even though a finding of special circumstances had been made was entirely consistent with principle (R v Simpson [2001] NSWCCA 534; 53 NSWLR 704 at [59] and [65] per Spigelman CJ). No error of the kind referred to in House v R [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499 at 504-505 has been demonstrated.
	
	
	I would reject ground 4 of Ms Vella’s application for leave to appeal against her sentence.
	


Grounds 2 and 3: Manifestly Excessive


	
	Ground 2 of the sentencing appeal contends that the sentence imposed upon Ms Vella was manifestly excessive “having regard to the Appellant’s history and background, in circumstances where [the sentencing judge] made no reference to the mitigating factors contained in s 21A of [the Sentencing Act]”. Ground 3 of the sentencing appeal was related to ground 2 and asserts as follows:
	


“That, in circumstances where it cannot be determined how Townsden DCJ reached the result embodied in the sentence, imposed upon the appellant, which is plainly unreasonable or unjust, it can be [inferred] that in some way, that there has been a failure to properly exercise the discretion, which has resulted in a substantial wrong, which substantial wrong is apparent when comparing the sentence, imposed by Townsden DCJ with sentences imposed by the Courts for offences of this nature.”


	
	These grounds can be dealt with together as they both involve a complaint of manifest excess.
	
	
	Part of the complaint of manifest excess in relation to ground 2 builds upon the other asserted errors in the sentencing process, especially his Honour’s conclusion that the offending was “towards the higher end of offences of this type”, a proposition I have already rejected.
	
	
	The balance of the submissions in relation to ground 2 contends that the sentencing judge failed to either consider or attach appropriate weight to certain factors, namely Ms Vella’s age, her relative lack of previous criminal history, the fact that the commission of the offence was said to be an “uncharacteristic aberration and totally out of character”, that her risk of reoffending was minimal, that the attempted execution of the crime was clumsy and no one was defrauded, and that she had had intermittent periods of depression, so that the injury, emotional harm, loss or damage caused by the offence was not substantial.
	
	
	However, the sentencing judge clearly did consider Ms Vella’s age, her criminal history, and the evidence concerning her psychological condition. Further, the nature of the offence did not reveal that its commission was “an uncharacteristic aberration and totally out of character”. To the contrary, the nature of the Crown case was that the commission of the offence was totally consistent with what was known about her usual pattern of behaviour. The contention that his Honour failed to have regard to the fact that the attempted execution of the crime was “clumsy and no one was defrauded” is another means of re-agitating his Honour’s finding as to the serious nature of the offence, a finding that has already been upheld.
	
	
	Ground 3 in part complains that it cannot be determined how the sentencing judge “reached the result embodied in the sentence”. This complaint travels nowhere. In general, a sentencing judgment does not reveal a mathematical relationship between the weighing of the various factors and the length of the sentence but instead it shows the process of “instinctive synthesis” of the various factors involved in sentencing and the exercise of a value judgment as to the appropriate sentence (Markarian v R [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at [51] per McHugh J).
	
	
	The submissions in relation to ground 3 referred to the sentences imposed in four other cases of conspiracy to defraud, and submit, by reference to those sentences, that the sentence imposed upon Ms Vella was manifestly excessive, namely Page v R [2007] NSWCCA 175 (“Page”), R v Wasson [2004] NSWCCA 200 (“Wasson”), R v Lewis [2003] NSWCCA 375 (“Lewis”) and R v Walsh [2000] VSC 114 (“Walsh”).
	
	
	In Page this Court dismissed an appeal against a total sentence of five years imprisonment with a non-parole period of two years and six months for a conspiracy to defraud. The appellant had participated in a conspiracy to swindle $397,500 from an elderly woman over a period of years by first convincing her that some unsolicited work on her roof had been paid for, although it had not been done, and then later requesting or demanding further sums from her on the basis that each payment would assist in recovering the amount she had been overcharged for the roof repairs. The Court held that the appellant was “deserving of a significant term of imprisonment” (at [69] per McClellan CJ at CL with whom Howie and Hall JJ agreed). Page is of no assistance to Ms Vella.
	
	
	In Wasson the applicant for leave to appeal was sentenced to two years imprisonment with a non-parole period of eighteen months for conspiring to dishonestly obtain a benefit by deception. The applicant and her co-conspirators had falsely reported to the police that a motor vehicle owned by one of them was stolen with the intention of destroying it and making a claim for compensation on the insurer. The written submissions in support of this ground assert that this Court in Wasson reduced the sentence of imprisonment for two years to a sentence of imprisonment for twelve months. This is incorrect. The appeal was dismissed. The submissions may have been intending to refer to Lewis in which this Court reduced the sentence of one of Wasson’s co-conspirators to twelve months on the basis that they had “strong subjective features” (Lewis at [12]). In any event, the maximum sentence for the equivalent statutory offence in Wasson and Lewis was five years imprisonment. Neither case affords any assistance to Ms Vella.
	
	
	In Walsh the offender was found guilty of conspiring to defraud the Nauru Phosphate Royalties Trust of approximately $61 million, and three counts of perverting the course of justice in relation to the investigation and prosecution of proceedings in relation to that offence. He was sentenced to a period of seven years imprisonment (Walsh at [57]) on the conspiracy to defraud count. The judgment in Walsh does not reveal what the maximum penalty for the equivalent statutory provision was.
	
	
	None of these cases proffer any assistance to Ms Vella. Each turns upon their own facts and a consideration of the maximum penalty for the equivalent statutory offence. Ms Vella’s case was unusual and a resort to other cases of conspiracy to defraud is of little assistance. She pursued a conspiracy to extract a large sum from an insurer through deception and the ruthless exploitation of her co-conspirator. Given his Honour’s findings on sentence, including the characterisation of the offence, I do not consider that the sentence was manifestly excessive.
	
	
	It follows that I would reject grounds 2 and 3 of Ms Vella’s application for leave to appeal her sentence.
	


Conclusion on Ms Vella’s sentence appeal


	
	Accordingly, I propose that Ms Vella be granted leave to appeal her sentence, but the appeal be dismissed.
	


Mr Siskos’ application for leave to appeal against sentence


	
	Mr Siskos relies on three grounds in support of his application for leave to appeal against his sentence. They can be dealt with briefly. He does not contend that the sentence imposed upon him was manifestly excessive.
	
	
	Mr Siskos’ first ground of appeal contends that his Honour erred in finding that the motive for committing the offence was one of greed.  The written submissions in support of this ground refer to that part of the sentencing judgment which is extracted in [144], and contend that his Honour erred because “the applicant’s motivation was not greed, but an irrational motive to facilitate [Ms] Vella’s greed by killing himself”.
	
	
	This ground of appeal misstates the effect of the sentencing judgment. In the passage extracted in [144], his Honour did not attribute to Mr Siskos a motivation of greed, but instead stated that the “motive for the conspiracy [was] greed”. In context, this statement was a reference to the object of the conspiracy which was to extract money from the insurance company and to the fact that the money was for the benefit of Ms Vella who had no real “need” for the funds. His Honour clearly recognised the subservient aspect of Mr Siskos’ participation in the passages referred to in [146] to [147].
	
	
	I would reject ground 1 of Mr Siskos' application for leave to appeal his sentence.
	
	
	Ground 2 of Mr Siskos’ application for leave to appeal contends that his Honour erred in finding that the offence was aggravated by a “degree of planning”.
	
	
	This ground attacks so much of his Honour’s sentencing judgment which refers to the offence as having “occurred over a relatively long period of time and there is evidence of a degree of planning involved as opposed to an impulsive offence”. The written submissions in support of the ground emphasised the simplistic nature of this conspiracy and contended that the “degree of planning in the applicant’s case is at the lowest end”. It was submitted that the only relevant action of Mr Siskos was to attend a meeting of an insurance broker, agree to an increase in the coverage for life insurance, and sign documentation.
	
	
	To the extent that this ground complains about his Honour’s finding as to the “relatively long period of time” over which the offending occurred then it has already been addressed ([153]ff). Otherwise this ground of appeal overstates his Honour’s finding. His Honour’s reference to the “degree of planning involved” contrasted this offence with an “impulsive offence”. Such an assessment was clearly open to his Honour given that the jury accepted the Crown case that Mr Siskos and Ms Vella attended upon the insurance agent in June 2010, and then waited out the thirteen month preclusion period before Mr Siskos took steps to end his own life. His Honour did not refer to this as an aggravating factor for the purposes of s 21A(2) of the Sentencing Act, but merely contrasted it with a more impulsive conspiracy entered into on the spur of the moment as part of the assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence.
	
	
	I would reject ground 2 of Mr Siskos’ application for leave to appeal his sentence.
	
	
	Ground 3 of Mr Siskos’ sentencing appeal complains that his Honour erred in his assessment that the objective seriousness of his offending was “more towards the high end of the scale”.
	
	
	This ground of appeal also refers to the finding of his Honour which is to be found at the end of the passage extracted at [144]. The written submissions in support of this ground invoke the complaints made in relation to grounds 1 and 2. They also contend that suicide is not unlawful and is usually considered as something addressed by mental health professionals and warranting a degree of sympathy. The written submissions noted that there was no loss to the insurance company. The submissions contended that “whilst a finding of high end criminality may have been open to his Honour with respect to Ms Vella, it was not a reasonably open finding with respect to [Mr Siskos]”.
	
	
	In my view this submission also misstates the effect of the sentencing judgment. In characterising this offence as at the “high end of the scale” his Honour was characterising the object and scope of the conspiracy which the applicant and Ms Vella had entered into. The conclusion that it was a very serious example of this offence was reinforced by the fact that a substantial amount of money was designed to be extracted from an insurance company, and that this was to be undertaken by one co-conspirator convincing another to commit suicide. The unusual nature of the applicant’s involvement was recognised by his Honour in the passages noted in [146] to [147]. This was an example of a conspiracy which was very serious but the sentencing exercise required that careful attention be paid to the need to address the role each co-conspirator played in the commission of the offence. The difference in the sentences imposed on Mr Siskos and Ms Vella reveals that his Honour appreciated that such an approach was required.
	
	
	I would reject ground 3 of Mr Siskos’ application for leave to appeal his sentence.

2703225,Bruce Edward Gall v R (No 2) [2015] NSWCCA 152,"Judgment


	
	HOEBEN CJ at CL: 
	


Nature of application

After a trial which took place between 27 August and 12 September 2012 the applicant (who had been tried jointly with his son, Kevin Anthony Gall), was found guilty of being an accessory after the fact to murder. The applicant and his co-offender were sentenced on 23 November 2012. The applicant appealed to this Court against his conviction and sentence and that appeal was heard on 20 February 2015 with judgment being handed down on 20 April 2015. The applicant’s appeal against conviction and sentence was dismissed. (Gall v R; Gall v R [2015] NSWCCA 69.)


	
	By letter dated 30 April 2015 the applicant made an application to re-open the appeal in this Court pursuant to Rule 50C of the Criminal Appeal Rules. Rule 50C provides:
	


“50C   Power to set aside or vary order

(1)   The Court may set aside or vary an order if an application for the setting aside or variation is made before entry of the order.

(2)   If an application for the setting aside or variation of an order is made within 14 days after the order is entered, the Court may determine the matter and (if appropriate) set aside or vary the order under sub-rule (1) as if the order had not been entered.

(3)   Within 14 days after an order is entered the Court may of its own motion set aside or vary the order as if the order had not been entered.

(4)   The Court may not extend the time limited by sub-rule (2) or (3).

(5)   Nothing in this rule affects any other power of the Court to set aside or vary an order.”

Applicant’s submissions


	
	In order to understand the applicant’s submissions, it is necessary to set out [172] – [183] of the principal judgment:
	


“172   The proviso has been applied even though a trial judge did not properly direct the jury on an element of the offence charged (R v Gulliford [2004] NSWCCA 338; 148 A Crim R 558, Festa v R [2001] HCA 72; 208 CLR 593). The issue on the proviso is whether Bruce Gall lost a real chance of being convicted of the lesser offence of being an accessory after the fact to manslaughter because of her Honour’s erroneous direction on that issue.

173   The Crown submitted that the evidence was such that the only rational inference open on the evidence was that Bruce Gall knew all of the facts which gave rise to the conviction of Kevin Gall for the offence of murder so that even if the jury had been properly directed, they could not rationally have come to any other conclusion but that Bruce Gall was an accessory after the fact to the murder of the deceased.

174   The Crown submitted that the jury had clearly rejected Kevin Gall’s evidence to the effect that he shot the deceased in order to protect his father and himself. The Crown submitted that it followed from that rejection that the jury had also rejected his evidence that Bruce Gall said to him, immediately before he shot the deceased, that the deceased had a gun. The Crown submitted that even without relying upon the evidence of Mr Fox (which the jury may not have wholly accepted) it would have been clear to Bruce Gall, after the shooting but before the hosing down of the car port, that neither the deceased nor Mr Fox had a gun. An inspection of the deceased would have made that clear and the compelling inference from the flight of Mr Fox without attempting to retaliate, was that he was not armed.

175   The Crown also relied upon the following extract from p 20 of Exhibit AC:

“BG   Yeah they had f’ing bats in the car. They had motor cycle helmets … pull them over your head.

PV   They didn’t have any guns or anything though, hey?

BG   No.

PV   No?

BG   They were looking for mine.

PV   They were looking for your guns?

BG   They were searching. You know when they were searching. That c… was looking in the back. That’s what he was looking for. He looked through the house. He said “I’m gunna look through your house”. …”

176   That part of the transcript of Exhibit AC (if accurate) provided very strong evidence that at no time did Bruce Gall believe that either the deceased or Mr Fox had guns before the deceased was shot.

177   In a supplementary written submission following the conclusion of oral submissions in the appeal, it was asserted on behalf of Kevin Gall (but not on behalf of Bruce Gall) that this part of the transcript was incorrectly transcribed. It was submitted that it was not clear that Bruce Gall said “no” or whether it was only Van Straalen that said “no” and that thereafter Bruce Gall said “yeah he had it on him” which has not been recorded in the transcript.

178   This point was not taken by either applicant at trial and has not been taken by Bruce Gall in the appeal. At trial the transcript of Exhibit AC was accepted as an accurate transcription of what the listening device was able to pick up and was tendered without objection (T.291.40). The submission is contrary to the evidence of Kevin Gall on this very point (T.467.4). A challenge to the accuracy and completeness of the transcript should not be allowed to be taken for the first time in the appeal. In any event, the issue was not raised in Bruce Gall’s appeal and I propose to disregard it.

179   The Crown submission should be accepted. The evidence was such that the only rational inference open was that Bruce Gall knew all the relevant facts relating to the shooting of the deceased and that there was no basis for a belief on his part that his son was trying to defend either him or himself.

180   The Crown position is even stronger when the evidence of Mr Fox is taken into account. Although the jury may not have accepted all of his evidence, they must have accepted most of it for them to reach the verdict which they did in relation to Kevin Gall.

181   It needs to be remembered that it is the state of knowledge of Bruce Gall which is relevant. He was in the presence of the deceased and Mr Fox for the whole of the time. Even before the death of the deceased and the flight of Mr Fox he was likely to have been well aware that they were not carrying guns. If they had been armed with guns, the compelling inference is that he would have been threatened with them. In that respect, the evidence of Mr Fox was almost certainly correct when he surmised that when Bruce Gall started to run he was not “fleeing” from the deceased but was going to either lock himself in the office or get a gun. It is also relevant that the layout and photographs of the premises make it clear that when Kevin Gall shot the deceased, Bruce Gall was running directly towards him.

182   The issue can be looked at in another way. The only evidence to the contrary depended upon an acceptance of Kevin Gall’s explanation for why he shot the deceased which was clearly rejected by the jury. There is no other evidence which would provide a rational basis for a belief on the part of Bruce Gall that his son was trying to defend him or himself. Not surprisingly, given the state of the evidence, no submission was made at trial that Bruce Gall may have thought that his son was trying to defend him.

183   This is a case in which the proviso to s6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 should be applied in that Bruce Gall did not lose a real chance of an acquittal on the more serious accessory charge. This ground of appeal has not been made out.”


	
	The applicant’s submissions were based on those paragraphs. The particular focus was on the conversation between the applicant, Kevin Gall and Peter Van Straalen at [175]. The conversation had been recorded on a listening device on 19 June 2010, some two months after the shooting of the deceased. The recording was tendered at the trial as exhibit AB (T.291) and a transcript of the recording as exhibit AC (T.291.40).
	
	
	The applicant submitted that at [178] of the judgment there had been a “misapprehension of the facts” when it was stated that “exhibit AC was accepted as an accurate transcription of what the listening device was able to pick up and was tendered without objection”. The applicant submitted that it was incorrect to say that the tender of exhibit AC was made without objection because there were significant qualifications associated with the tender. The applicant noted that the jury was told:
	


“I tender as an aid memoire a transcript of the conversation but of course with the proviso is that there may be some inaccuracies and your Honour will give the usual direction to the jury about listening for themselves.”

The applicant submitted that a misapprehension of fact had occurred when in the principal judgment the Court had mistakenly concluded that the transcript, exhibit AC, was an accurate record of what was said and by whom.


	
	The applicant submitted that the extract from p 20 of exhibit AC, which was set out at [175] of the judgment and which was in part relied upon for a conclusion that the proviso applied, was incorrect in a significant way. The applicant submitted that when one listened to the recording (exhibit AB), the error in the transcription became obvious and was even more obvious when an enhanced audio analysis of the recording was carried out.
	
	
	Based on the enhanced audio analysis, the applicant submitted that the relevant part of p 20 of exhibit AC should have read:
	


“BG: They had fucking bats in the car. They had fucking motor cycle helmets. They close his neck (spoken over by another person) an’ pull them over your head.

PV:   They didn’t have any guns or anything, eh?

BG:   Yeah.

PV:   No.

BG:   Yeah, he had it on him …. They were looking for mine I’ll tell yer.

PV:   They were looking for your guns?

BG:   Yeah, yeah. You know where ya search? He chucked them.

PV:   Ughmmm.

BG:    That cunt was looking in the back and that was what he was looking for. Then he went to my house and he said “I’m gunna fuck’n look through your house and find it””.


	
	The underlined portions are those which differ from p 20 of exhibit AC.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that this evidence, if correct, undermined in a significant way the reasoning supporting the application of the proviso in the applicant’s appeal against conviction. The applicant submitted that this was because the evidence from the listening device would not support the conclusion that the applicant had told Van Straalen that the intruders were not armed at the time of the shooting. Instead it would support the conclusion that he had in fact confirmed that the men, or at least one of them, were armed.
	
	
	The applicant conceded that this issue was not raised by those appearing for him at trial and in the appeal. He explained that by saying that until the handing down of the Court’s judgment the significance of the new material to the success or failure of his appeal was not appreciated by his legal advisers. The applicant submitted that on a matter of such significance it was essential that the evidence of the recording itself, and any other evidence that might cast doubt on the accuracy of p 20 of exhibit AC, should be the subject of careful examination and evaluation by the Court. The applicant submitted that the transcript was no more than an aid memoire and that even if there had been a general acceptance of its accuracy at trial and during the appeal, the fact that evidence had subsequently emerged which cast a doubt on the accuracy of that transcript could not be ignored.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that the evidence of Kevin Gall at T.467.4 of the trial transcript, as referred to at [178] of the principal judgment, was not decisive on this issue. On that issue, the applicant relied on the evidence of Kevin Gall at T.503-4 which he submitted placed considerable doubt on the reliability of the earlier evidence in that it was obvious from the later trial transcript that Kevin Gall did not have a recollection of the detail of the conversation between the applicant and Van Straalen. The applicant noted that when this evidence was given no attempt was made to play the recording. There was simply a reliance on the content of p 20 of exhibit AC. The applicant submitted that because Kevin Gall was being asked more than two years later to comment on what he (the applicant) had actually said in June 2010, his evidence on this issue was equivocal and had little probative value. The applicant submitted that this was particularly so when the actual recording was available and could be listened to.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that this Court should re-open the appeal proceedings, listen to the actual recording of p 20 of exhibit AC and receive into evidence the affidavit of Ali Abbas, dated 10 April 2015. (Mr Abbas was the solicitor for Kevin Gall who forwarded the unsolicited affidavit to the Court annexing an enhanced audio recording of p 20 of exhibit AC which is referred to at [177] of the principal judgment.) The applicant submitted that this Court should have regard to both the actual recording of the listening device (exhibit AB) and to the enhanced audio analysis of that recording, together with the revised transcript of the conversation at p 20 of exhibit AC.
	


Consideration


	
	The Court of Criminal Appeal was established by the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) and subsequent amendments. Its jurisdiction is confined within the limits of the Act and when the Court has heard an appeal on its merits and given its decision, the appeal cannot be re-opened. This is subject only to the rules of court which allow an appeal to be revisited if an application is made within the time prescribed by the rules.
	
	
	The principle of finality has a significant role to play in the proper disposal of appeals. Re-arguing or re-agitating issues which have already been decided by a court involves an unacceptable and unavailable departure from the principle of finality.
	
	
	In Burrell v The Queen [2008] HCA 34; 238 CLR 218 the plurality (Gummow ACJ, Hayne, Heydon, Crennan and Kiefel JJ) said:
	


“15   Secondly, it is important to recognise that underpinning consideration of the issues presented in this matter are fundamental principles about finality of litigation. As was said in D'Orta-Ekenaike v Victoria Legal Aid: ""A central and pervading tenet of the judicial system is that controversies, once resolved, are not to be reopened except in a few, narrowly defined, circumstances."" That tenet finds reflection in rules concerning the bringing of an action to set aside a final judgment on the ground that it was procured by fraud and in doctrines of res judicata and issue estoppel. The principal qualification to the general principle of finality is provided by the appellate system. But in courts other than the court of final resort, the tenet also finds reflection in the restrictions upon reopening of final orders after they have been formally recorded.

16   The third consideration of principle which it is necessary to state at the outset is related to the second. It is that the principle of finality serves not only to protect parties to litigation from attempts to re-agitate what has been decided, but also has wider purposes. In particular, the principle of finality serves as the sharpest spur to all participants in the judicial process, judges, parties and lawyers alike, to get it right the first time. Later correction of error is not always possible. If it is possible, it is often difficult and time-consuming, and it is almost always costly.”


	
	Rule 50C was introduced by the Criminal Appeal Rules (Amendment No 1) No 455 of 2007 and came into operation in September 2007. The explanatory note in the Government Gazette when the amending rules were published reads as follows:
	


“The object of these Rules is to amend the Criminal Appeal Rules so as to require orders under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 to be entered and to enable them to be set aside and varied in ways similar to those for judgments and orders under the Civil Procedure Act 2005.”


	
	The genesis of the rule was the problem which arose in Burrell. The Court of Criminal Appeal in Burrell had occasion to consider its power to re-visit a decision made on an erroneous view of the facts. The court held that in the circumstances of that case it did have such power, but the circumstances and authorities referred to made obvious the advantage of putting the matter beyond doubt by the creation of a Rule. In fact the Court of Criminal Appeal’s decision as to the existence of such a power was overruled by the High Court in Burrell.
	
	
	The first consideration of the rule occurred in Alramadan v DPP (NSW)  (No 2) [2008] NSWCCA 69. The Court of Criminal Appeal had previously dismissed the applicant’s appeal against conviction (Alramadan v DPP (NSW) [2007] NSWCCA 322). The basis of the application under Rule 50C was the availability of two further statements made by medical witnesses for the accused. There was a statement from Dr Nicholls, an orthopaedic surgeon, to the effect that the applicant would have had great difficulty in climbing onto the examination table in his surgery and having sexual intercourse with the complainant in the manner alleged. The other statement was from Dr White to the effect that although semen from the applicant was found on a “high vaginal swab” obtained from the complainant, such could occur otherwise than through “normal intercourse”.
	
	
	The evidence of those doctors had been ruled inadmissible at trial and the applicant had not put that material before the Court of Criminal Appeal. Following the dismissal of his appeal, the applicant sought to rely upon Rule 50C as a basis for re-opening the appeal and adducing that further evidence.
	
	
	When considering the application the Court of Criminal Appeal (Basten JA with whom Latham and Rothman JJ agreed) concluded that the broad terms of the explanatory note needed to be seen in the light of the remarks of Dixon J in Grierson v R [1938] HCA 45; 60 CLR 431 at 436 in the passage cited with approval in Elliott v The Queen; Blessington v The Queen [2007] HCA 51; 234 CLR 38 at [7]. There Dixon J addressed the effect of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 at p 436:
	


“…The determination of an appeal is evidently definitive, and a conviction unappealed is equally final. No considerations controlling or affecting the conclusion to be deduced from these provisions are supplied by analogous civil proceedings.""


	
	Basten JA said:
	


“6   Where judgment has been given but the order has not been entered the power to reconsider an appeal is not precluded. Nevertheless, the circumstances in which the Court will be persuaded to entertain further argument (and possibly further evidence) are quite limited. In Elliott and Blessington at [31] – [32], the High Court held that the criteria by which this Court should determine an application to re-open a proceeding prior to judgment being entered were those stated by Mason CJ in Autodesk Inc v Dyason (No 2) [1993] HCA 6; 176 CLR 300 at 303:

“What must emerge, in order to enliven the exercise of the jurisdiction, is that the Court has apparently proceeded according to some misapprehension of the facts or the relevant law and that this misapprehension cannot be attributed solely to the neglect or default of the party seeking the rehearing. The purpose of the jurisdiction is not to provide a backdoor method by which unsuccessful litigants can seek to reargue their cases.”

7    Applying those principles in the present case, it is necessary to identify some misapprehension of fact or law, not solely attributable to the applicant, which materially affected this Court’s judgment in the appeal.

8    The basis of the present application was the availability of two further statements by witnesses for the accused, whose evidence was rejected at trial. The difficulty which the applicant faces is that the sole reason this material was not considered by the Court at the hearing of the appeal was that he did not put it before the Court. The difficulty he faces in satisfying the test adopted in Elliott and Blessington is immediately apparent. However, it is desirable to explain in a little more detail the relevance of the material on the case presented for the applicant.

…

14   As indicated above, this is a clear case of a reopening being proposed in order to enable the applicant to reargue the appeal. If the Court acted under some misapprehension as to the relevant facts at the hearing of the appeal, that was solely due to the manner in which the appellant ran his case. …”


	
	The approach of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Alramadan (No 2) was affirmed in Kauwenberghs v R [2009] NSWCCA 201. In that matter the applicant pleaded guilty in the District Court to an indictment containing five drug related counts and was sentenced on 5 May 2006. The applicant successfully appealed against the severity of his sentence and was re-sentenced. The applicant then sought to vary those orders as provided for in Rule 50C. The basis for the application was that the court did not have before it the applicant’s grounds of appeal and the written submissions he prepared but instead had the grounds of appeal and written submissions prepared by his former lawyers, both of which he had specifically abandoned when he assumed the conduct of the appeal himself. The Court had determined the appeal based upon his former lawyers’ submissions and the grounds of appeal filed by them.
	
	
	The Court (Beazley JA, Hall and Fullerton JJ) concluded that none of the issues or grounds pursued by the applicant on the appeal were overlooked or were the subject of a misapprehension of the kind that enlivened the exercise of the Court’s power under Rule 50C. The Court said:
	


“8   … In Alramadan the Court held that the power to vary or set aside orders made consequent upon an appeal against conviction (or an application for leave to appeal against sentence) is to be understood and applied commensurate with the power the Court has always had under the general law to vary or set aside orders in an appropriate case. The Court also emphasised that after a full hearing on the merits of an appeal against conviction or sentence the circumstances in which further argument should be entertained on an application to vary or set aside its orders are quite limited. In that regard it cited the judgment of Mason CJ in Autodesk Inc v Dyason (No 2) [1993] HCA 6; 176 CLR 300 at 303 where his Honour identified the criteria by which an application to re-open a proceeding should be decided. His Honour said:

“What must emerge, in order to enliven the exercise of the jurisdiction, is that the Court has apparently proceeded according to some misapprehension of the facts or the relevant law and that this misapprehension cannot be attributed solely to the neglect or default of the party seeking the rehearing. The purpose of the jurisdiction is not to provide a backdoor method by which unsuccessful litigants can seek to re-argue their cases.”

It was this approach which the Court in Alramadan accepted as the proper approach when an application is brought under r 50C of the Criminal Appeal Rules.

9    In applying those principles to this application, the Crown submitted, in our view correctly, that there are three questions that require an affirmative answer before the Court would be entitled to consider varying the orders entered on 29 July 2008.

10    The first question is whether, in considering the application for leave to appeal against sentence, the Court proceeded (or apparently proceeded) according to some misapprehension of fact or law. Unless that has occurred the application to vary the sentencing order must be dismissed. If it is established that the Court proceeded according to some misapprehension of fact or law, the Court must then be satisfied that the matter complained of affected its consideration of the merits of the appeal in some material way. That is, the misapprehension must be a material one. Again, unless that matter is established, the application to vary the sentencing order must fail. Assuming the materiality of the misapprehension of fact or law, the final question is whether it was due to the applicant’s neglect or default.

11   Although the applicant did not cast his submissions in accordance with the principles to which we have referred, it is essential on this application that the question whether the Court should vary or set aside its orders be resolved strictly in accordance with those principles since to do otherwise is to run the risk that the application takes on the character of an appeal or a re-hearing of the original appeal.”


	
	In R v AB (No 2) [2011] NSWCCA 256 the Court (Bathurst CJ, Hoeben and Johnson JJ) considered the application of Rule 50C. The facts were that the Court had given judgment in a Crown appeal allowing the appeal and making orders which effectively increased the period of imprisonment (R v AB [2011] NSWCCA 229). Two errors in the judgment were subsequently brought to the attention of the Court.
	
	
	The errors were that a slip had been made in the calculation of the period of aggregation of the notional sentences creating a three month gap between the expiry of the sentence on count 3 and the commencement of the sentence on count 4, during which period the offender would not be serving a sentence. Secondly, it was not open to the Court to impose an aggregate sentence pursuant to s 53A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 because s 53A did not apply to sentences for offences in respect of which a plea of guilty had been entered before the commencement of that section.
	
	
	Both the Crown and the offender requested the Court to make orders under Rule 50C to overcome the agreed errors. The Court held that both of those issues constituted a misapprehension of fact or law not solely attributable to the parties which materially affected the Court’s judgment in the appeal and that it was appropriate for orders to be made under Rule 50C to remedy the position.
	
	
	The Court most recently considered Rule 50C in PFC v R (No 2) [2014] NSWCCA 241. There the Court (Fullerton, R A Hulme and Garling JJ) reviewed previous authorities and said:
	


“26   The Court noted in Alramadan that in applying Rule 50C in its terms, the Court:

""... will have the same powers under the Criminal Appeal Act, taking into account relevant principles under the general law, as it has always had in relation to orders which have not been entered.""

27   The Court then proceeded to consider the proper application of Rule 50C. It said this:

""6    Where judgment has been given but the order has not been entered, the power to reconsider an appeal is not precluded. Nevertheless, the circumstances in which the Court will be persuaded to entertain further argument (and possibly further evidence) are quite limited. In Elliott and Blessington at [31]-[32], the High Court held that the criteria by which this Court should determine an application to re-open a proceeding, prior to judgment being entered, were those stated by Mason CJ in Autodesk Inc v Dyason (No. 2) [1993] HCA 6; 176 CLR 300 at 303:

'What must emerge, in order to enliven the exercise of the jurisdiction, is that the Court has apparently proceeded according to some misapprehension of the facts or the relevant law and that this misapprehension cannot be attributed solely to the neglect or default of the party seeking the rehearing. The purpose of the jurisdiction is not to provide a backdoor method by which unsuccessful litigants can seek to reargue their cases.'""

28   The Court went on to say this:

""7   Applying those principles in the present case, it is necessary to identify some misapprehension of fact or law, not solely attributable to the applicant, which materially affected this Court's judgment in the appeal.""

29   The Court again considered the application of Rule 50C in Kauwenberghs v R [2009] NSWCCA 201. The Court, in applying Alramadan, held that there were three questions which required an affirmative answer before the Court would be entitled to consider varying the original set of orders. It expressed those questions in this way:

""10   The first question is whether, in considering the application for leave to appeal against sentence, the Court proceeded (or apparently proceeded) according to some misapprehension of fact or law. Unless that has occurred the application to vary the ... order must be dismissed. If it is established that the Court proceeded according to some misapprehension of fact or law, the Court must then be satisfied that the matter complained of affected its consideration of the merits of the appeal in some material way. That is, the misapprehension must be a material one. Again, unless that matter is established, the application to vary the ... order must fail. Assuming the materiality of the misapprehension of fact or law, the final question is whether it was due to the applicant's neglect or default.""

30   The Court went on to say that it was essential that on an application under Rule 50C that the Court resolve the application in accordance with the principles enunciated:

""... since to do otherwise is to run the risk that the application takes on the character of an appeal or a re-hearing of the original appeal"".

31   In a number of judgments since, the Court has applied this approach to applications made pursuant to Rule 50C: see R v AB (No 2) [2011] NSWCCA 256; Baghdadi v R (No. 2) [2012] NSWCCA 77; Akkawi v R (No 2) [2013] NSWCCA 72.

32   Accordingly, in considering the submissions, both written and oral, of PFC, together with the additional documentation identified, this Court will need to consider first, whether the first Court in its first judgment proceeded, or apparently proceeded, on a misapprehension of fact, or of law, and if it do so, whether any such misapprehension was material?

33   If either of these questions are not answered affirmatively, then the application must be dismissed. If ultimately satisfied of each of those matters, the Court will need to consider the question of neglect or default, on the part of the applicant, before considering whether the orders should be varied.

…

126   In our view, the substance of the oral submissions (including those referred to in writing) of PFC was an attempt to re-argue his appeal. They do not demonstrate any misapprehension of fact or law in the first judgment.”


	
	By reference to those decided cases, Rule 50C is of limited application with an emphasis on correcting obvious mistakes in language used or results that did not reflect the intention of the Court. Rule 50C has been used:
	


To correct a slip, being the omission of words to clarify an infelicitous or ambiguous expression. When doing so it was not altering the basis or rationale of the judgment as it was originally intended (R v Jones; R v Hili (No 2) [2010] NSW CCA 195; 79 NSWLR 143 at [49].

To overcome agreed difficulties where there was a gap of three months from the conclusion of the notional sentence on a count and the commencement of the notional sentence on the next count and it was appropriate to remedy that slip (R v AB (No 2).

When the Court had not considered a ground of appeal (Baghdadi v R  (No 2) – [2012] NSWCCA 77).

To effect the orders proposed in the reasons for judgment with the correct calculation of the aggregate head sentence (Akkawi, Mark v R; Akkawi, Paul v R (No 2) [2013] NSWCCA 72).

To restructure sentences to achieve an aggregate non-parole period which reflected the Court’s intention (KW v R (No 2) [2013] NSWCCA 84).

To correct some minor accidental slips which included the numbering of the orders and some minor changes of wording, neither of which altered the substance of the reasons or the orders made (R v Ly (No 2) [2014] NSWCCA 91).


	
	Three of the cases discussed above involved the applicant seeking orders which amounted to an appeal against the Court of Criminal Appeal’s decision. In Alramadan (No 2) the Court took the view that the applicant was seeking to re-open the appeal so as to remedy deficiencies in the material presented at the hearing and held that such an approach “would appear to fall squarely within the impermissible purpose of seeking “by a back door method” to re-argue an unsuccessful appeal”. It could not be justified on the criteria explained by Mason CJ in Autodesk Inc v Dyason (No 2) [1993] HCA 6; 176 CLR 300; Alramadan (No 2)  at [12].
	
	
	In Kauwenberghs the Court did not consider that any of the issues in the grounds pursued by the applicant had been overlooked or were the subject of a misapprehension of a kind that enlivened the exercise of the Court’s power under Rule 50C. Similarly, in PFC it was held that the substance of the oral submissions was an attempt to re-argue the appeal and the entirety of the submissions did not demonstrate any misapprehension of fact or law in the first judgment.
	
	
	The misapprehension of fact relied upon by the applicant is that the Court mistakenly concluded that p 20 of exhibit AC was an accurate record of what was said and by whom. There are a number of difficulties with that submission.
	
	
	The Crown does not accept that the transcript at p 20 of exhibit AC is incorrect and asserts that the recording exhibit AB was correctly transcribed and in particular, that the recording does not contain a response by the applicant to the effect of “yeah he had it on him”. The Crown submitted that not only were those words not used by the applicant in the recorded conversation but that such words were quite inconsistent with the tenor of the conversation. Accordingly, the asserted misapprehension of fact is a matter in dispute.
	
	
	The accuracy of p 20 of exhibit AC was never an issue at trial. Not only was it not an issue, it was accepted by all parties as accurate. Kevin Gall’s counsel asked him questions with specific reference to p 20 of exhibit AC. Implicit in the questions was the accuracy of that transcript (T.467). Similarly, the Crown cross-examined Kevin Gall with specific reference to p 20 of exhibit AC. Again, implicit in those questions was the accuracy of the transcript on which he was cross-examined (T.503.-4). Most significantly counsel for the applicant (who did not give evidence in the trial) said at the beginning of his closing address “He does not dispute that Kevin Gall shot dead Neil Green. He does not dispute that Neil Green was at the time not armed” (T.621).
	
	
	The recording (exhibit AB) was played to the jury during the trial. No part of its transcription, which became exhibit AC, was disputed.
	
	
	During the appeal, no point was taken as to the accuracy of p 20 of exhibit AC. Its accuracy was accepted. In oral submissions, senior counsel for the applicant made a submission which assumed its accuracy (appeal transcript T.15). The first indication that any part of p 20 of exhibit AC might be inaccurate was in the affidavit of Mr Abbas of 10 April 2015. Mr Abbas, of course, was retained by Kevin Gall not the applicant. The purpose of that issue being raised on behalf of Kevin Gall was never made clear since it was irrelevant to any of the issues raised by him on the appeal. Significantly, even at that late stage no challenge to the accuracy of p 20 of exhibit AC was made by the applicant.
	
	
	Another problem with the asserted misapprehension of fact is that if p 20 of exhibit AC should be read as the applicant asserts, it would be the only evidence to that effect in the trial. It would be inconsistent with the interpretation of the conversation accepted by him at trial, inconsistent with the evidence at trial, particularly that of Kevin Gall and inconsistent with the position adopted by him through his counsel at trial. There was no evidence that the deceased or Fox had firearms. On the contrary, the evidence of Kevin Gall was that they did not have firearms (T.466, 467, 510).
	
	
	In those circumstances, I am not satisfied that there has been a misapprehension of fact as required by Rule 50C. The correct characterisation of what the applicant is seeking to do is to re-open the appeal so that he can raise matters which could and should have been raised at trial and on appeal but were not. The effect of the applicant being allowed to do so would be to re-argue the appeal on a different basis to that adopted by the applicant, both at trial and on the appeal.
	
	
	There is another problem with this application. If it be the case that there has been a misapprehension of fact of the kind that would engage Rule 50C, that misapprehension can be attributed solely to the neglect or default of the applicant. If in the trial, or even in the appeal, the applicant wished to raise as an issue that he had a genuine belief that either or both the deceased and Fox had a firearm, he could and should have done so. There was nothing to stop the applicant, or his legal advisers, both at trial and in the appeal from listening carefully to any relevant parts of exhibit AB and making submissions thereon. That was not done. It follows that any misapprehension of fact by the Court at the hearing of the appeal was solely due to the manner in which the applicant ran his case.
	
	
	The order I propose is that the application pursuant to Rule 50C of the Criminal Appeal Rules to vary the orders made by the Court of Criminal Appeal on 20 April 2015 be dismissed.
	
	
	R A HULME J: I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.
	
	
	DAVIES J: I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.

2703226,Majok v R [2015] NSWCCA 160,"Judgment


	
	HOEBEN CJ at CL: I agree with R A Hulme J.
	
	
	HALL J: I agree with R A Hulme J
	
	
	R A HULME J: Kachuol Majok (""the applicant"") was found guilty by a jury in September 2012 of offences of assault occasioning actual bodily harm in company and causing grievous bodily harm with intent to do so. He was sentenced in March 2013 by his Honour Judge Bennett SC to an overall term of 9 years 6 months with a non-parole period of 5 years.
	
	
	The applicant filed a notice of application for leave to appeal on 19 January 2015 and seeks an extension of time for such filing as a notice of intention to appeal expired on 28 April 2014. The Crown argued that an extension of time should be refused having regard to the principle of finality and that the proposed appeal lacks merit. The delay is largely explained by regrettable actions and inactions of lawyers rather than fault on the part of the applicant himself. An extension of time should be allowed.
	
	
	There is one proposed ground of appeal: ""His Honour erred in his summing up resulting in a miscarriage of justice"". There is no appeal against sentence.
	


The Crown case


	
	The Crown case was that in the early hours of 31 October 2009 at Blacktown the applicant and two other men, all of Sudanese heritage, assaulted Michael Skordis and caused him bodily harm. In a separate incident a short time later, elsewhere but still in Blacktown, the applicant and his two companions assaulted Matthew Nagy intending to cause him grievous bodily harm. He sustained a significant brain injury. The two alleged co-offenders were Fadllaseed Tombe (who was tried together with the applicant and also found guilty) and Godwill Zakria (who was tried separately and also found guilty).
	
	
	There was no issue in the trial that Messrs Skordis and Nagy were assaulted and sustained the degree of harm that the Crown alleged. The sole issue was whether the applicant, Tombe and Zakria were the assailants.
	
	
	The evidence in the trial concerned three events.
	


The preliminary event - an altercation at the railway station


	
	The first event occurred at around 12.50am when there was an altercation at Blacktown railway station between a group of Sudanese men and a group of Caucasian men and women. Police attended the scene and ordered most of the people to disperse. Tombe claimed to have been assaulted. He and the applicant went with a police officer (Leading Senior Constable Martin) to the nearby police station so that statements could be taken. However, whilst they waited in the foyer it could be seen that a group of Caucasian males outside were walking away. Tombe said to LSC Martin, ""forget about it"" and he and the applicant left. It was the Crown case that they were aggrieved and resented the earlier actions of the Caucasian males.
	
	
	Yasmine Eastlake was in Parramatta with her then boyfriend, Godwill Zakria. She received a phone call from the applicant in the early hours of the morning in which he told her that he had been involved in an incident in which he had been attacked by ""some white men"". She and Zakria drove to Blacktown. She met the applicant and Tombe at the police station but they only remained a short time before the four left in her car.
	


The second event - an assault upon Michael Skordis


	
	Michael Skordis, who was in the company of a number of the Caucasian men involved in the earlier incident, was walking home with some of his companions after having been told by the police to disperse. When he was at the intersection of Kildare and Walters Roads he was attacked by a number of Sudanese men armed with what he thought were baseball bats. There was no dispute that he sustained actual bodily harm. There was inconsistency between the prosecution's witnesses as to how many Sudanese men were involved and inconsistencies with what the witnesses had said on past occasions on this subject. However, the Crown case was that there were three assailants.
	
	
	Ms Eastlake's evidence was that she drove the applicant, Tombe and Zakria away from the police station. She followed directions given to her by one or the other of the passengers. She was directed to drive down Kildare Road and turn into Walters Road and stop. The three men then got out of the car but she remained. She said she heard the applicant slamming the boot of her car closed. When the men returned there were others chasing them. When they got back into the car they said, ""drive, drive, drive"", so she drove off down Walters Road away from Kildare Road.
	
	
	An important aspect of the evidence for the Crown was that witnesses described Mr Skordis' assailants running to a car and leaving the scene. One of the witnesses recorded the complete registration number of the car and another recalled a portion of it. There was no dispute that this identified Ms Eastlake's car. The defence case was that it was not the assailants who ran to the car but men (the accused and Zakria) who had been mere bystanders.
	


The third event - an assault upon Matthew Nagy


	
	Andrea Gorton, the girlfriend of Matthew Nagy, gave evidence that they had been with the Caucasian group at the incident at the railway station. When everyone dispersed they were given a lift by the mother of one of their companions to a point where they were dropped off and they proceeded to walk down Walters Road to Mr Nagy's home.
	
	
	The Crown contended that as Ms Eastlake was driving down Walters Road, the occupants would have seen Mr Nagy and Ms Gorton and that Ms Eastlake was then directed to drive into side streets and stop so that the men could alight and come out from St Pauls Way to the footpath on Walters Road to carry out a further assault.
	
	
	Ms Gorton's evidence was that as they walked down Walters Road and came to St Pauls Way she saw the headlights of a car shining towards them from St Pauls Way. Three Sudanese men armed with what she thought were baseball bats and a ""trolley pole"" approached. One of the men menaced her with a bat in a fashion which she took to be a warning that she should stay back. The three men proceeded to strike Mr Nagy at least 20 times with the implements. He quickly dropped to the ground.
	
	
	An important piece of evidence for the defence case was that Ms Gorton knew Mr Tombe from school and had recognised him at the railway station. However, her evidence was that she did not recognise any of Mr Nagy's three assailants.
	
	
	Ms Eastlake denied that the men had weapons when they got back into her car after the earlier stop in Walters Road and denied that the boot was accessed then or when she stopped the second time. The Crown cross-examined her about this and put to her that these aspects of her evidence were untruthful.
	
	
	The police investigation did not recover anything that might have been a weapon used in the assaults.
	
	
	In relation to Ms Eastlake's car, the applicant's and Mr Tombe's fingerprints were found but the Crown accepted that this did not amount to anything of significance because they had been passengers in the car on previous occasions. No blood was found. Swabs were taken but did not reveal any DNA relevant to the alleged offenders or victims.
	


A circumstantial case


	
	The submissions for the applicant accurately identified the following facts comprising the Crown's circumstantial case that he, Tombe and Zakria were the assailants:
	


""(a)   Both assaults were committed in close proximity by Sudanese men with weapons

(b)   The Appellant (195cm to 205cm tall: T530) and his co-accused (Tombe 190 - 195cm tall; Zakria 175 - 185cm tall: T530), in a very broad sense, have an appearance that is consistent with the description of the offenders in each crime (tall, slender, Sudanese)

(c)   The Appellant and Tombe had a motive to assault both complainants because of the earlier altercation at the Blacktown Railway Station. (Andrea Gorton heard one of Nagy's attackers say ""Why are you messing with our brothers"" (T79).)

(d)   The persons that assaulted Skordis were seen to immediately enter Eastlake's car and drive off

(e)   Eastlake confirmed that the Appellant, Tombe and Zakria were the men in her car and that they momentarily exited her car near where the assault on Skordis occurred

(f)   Eastlake confirmed that she drove the Appellant, Tombe and Zakria to an area close to where the second assault occurred and that the men once again momentarily left the vehicle.""


	
	On the Crown case, the only rational inference available from this collection of circumstances was that it was the applicant, Tombe and Zakria who committed the two attacks.
	
	
	Neither the applicant nor Tombe gave evidence or called witnesses. Their cases were identical. They were present at the altercation at the railway station and attended the police station shortly thereafter. They then left the area, with Zakria, in Eastlake's car and were driven to the vicinity of where Mr Skordis was assaulted. They alighted from the car at that point but were not involved in the assault. They were then driven to the vicinity of where Mr Nagy was assaulted where they again alighted but they were not involved in that assault either. There were other Sudanese males around who must have been responsible for the assaults.
	


General submissions


	
	Counsel for the applicant submitted that the summing up by the trial judge caused a miscarriage of justice because of the manner in which his Honour conveyed the competing arguments to the jury. The judge expressed agreement with some matters favourable to the Crown and continuously undermined arguments made on behalf of the applicant. It was submitted that this was done with such force as to deprive the applicant of a fair trial. A number of ""examples"" were cited in the written submissions which will be discussed in turn below.
	
	
	The Crown's submissions were to the effect that each of the matters identified in the applicant's submissions had been put to the jury by counsel in the course of the trial and were properly left to the jury in the trial judge's summing up. It was submitted that on no occasion did the trial judge express a view as to what aspects of the evidence should be accepted by the jury.
	


Principles relating to a fair and balanced summing up


	
	The overarching principle is that ""the requirement of fairness means that ordinarily the respective cases for the prosecution and the accused must be accurately and fairly put to the jury"": Domican v The Queen [1992] HCA 13; 173 CLR 555 at 560-561.
	
	
	In Robinson v R [2006] NSWCCA 192; 162 A Crim R 88, Johnson J stated (at [140]) the following as to the need for impartiality and balance in a summing up:
	


""[T]he judge's role in a criminal trial is to hold the balance between the contending parties without himself taking part in their disputations; the judge does not exercise an inquisitorial role in which he seeks himself to remedy the deficiencies in the case on either side, nor is it part of the function of the trial judge to don the mantle of prosecution or defence counsel: Whitehorn at 682. The fundamental task of a trial judge is to ensure a fair trial: R v Meher [2004] NSWCCA 355 at paragraph 76. Trial judges should normally refrain from advancing an argument in support of the Crown case that was not put by the Crown. There are two reasons for the unacceptability of a judge using the summing up as a vehicle for strengthening the Crown case - first, it is inconsistent with judicial impartiality and secondly, to do so denies the prosecution and the defence the opportunity either to disavow, or to meet the argument: R v Meher at paragraphs 87-93.""


	
	As to the ability of a judge to express a view about the facts, in R v Zorad (1990) 19 NSWLR 91, the Court stated (at 106-7):
	


""A judge is always entitled to express his view of the facts, provided that he does so with moderation and provided always that he [or she] makes it clear that it is the jury's function (and not his [or hers]) to decide the facts and that it is their duty to disregard the view which he [or she] has expressed (or which he [or she] may appear to hold) if it does not agree with their own independent assessment of the facts."" (Citations omitted)


	
	In RPS v The Queen [2000] HCA 3; 199 CLR 620 it was stated by Gaudron ACJ, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ at [42]:
	


""… it has long been held that a trial judge may comment (and comment strongly) on factual issues. But although a trial judge may comment on the facts, the judge is not bound to do so except to the extent that the judge's other functions require it. Often, perhaps much more often than not, the safer course for a trial judge will be to make no comment on the facts beyond reminding the jury, in the course of identifying the issues before them, of the arguments of counsel"".


	
	As to a judge going beyond the arguments that were presented by the Crown, Wood CJ at CL said in R v Meher [2004] NSWCCA 355:
	


""[87] Finally, it may be observed that trial judges should normally refrain from advancing an argument in support of the Crown case that was not put by the Crown. It is one thing to bring to the attention of a jury an alternative lesser count, that is fairly open on the evidence, or an available defence, even though it was not mentioned by the Crown Prosecutor and defence counsel, in their closing addresses, for example manslaughter in a case where the accused was indicted on a count for murder. It is quite another thing for a judge to advance an argument, on behalf of the Crown in support of the Prosecution case, which the judge considers was available, but was either overlooked, or not used by the Prosecution.

[88] There are two reasons for the unacceptability of a judge using the summing up as a vehicle for strengthening the Prosecution case. First it is inconsistent with judicial impartiality. Secondly, to do so denies the Prosecution and the defence the opportunity either to disavow, or to meet the argument.

[89] The observations of this Court in a joint judgment (Spigelman CJ, Wood CJ at CL, and Kirby J) in R v RTB [2002] NSWCCA 104 are apposite:

'[55] In the present case, both of the issues that have arisen were of a character that could have been put by the Crown as a suggestion to the jury. In neither case was there any necessity for the trial judge to say anything to the jury. There was no suggestion of any unfairness to the Crown in the way the case was conducted. Nor was there any other reason for the trial judge to put an argument not advanced by counsel. (see e.g. R v Heuston (1995) 81 A Crim R 387 at 393).

…

[59] In each of the two respects of which complaint is now made, the intervention of the trial judge urged upon the jury a particular mode of thought. His Honour suggested that there could have been an explanation for the deficiency in the complainant's evidence, of a character which was not of itself based on any evidence but which, to a legal mind, would appear to be in each case a logical possibility. Juries are not required to think like that.

[60] The fact that each of these 'possibilities' was put to the jury by the trial judge, rather than by the Crown, may have directed that the jury's collective mind in assessing credibility in a particular way. Specifically, the thrust of the trial judge's directions, on each of the two occasions, was that, notwithstanding the appearance of inconsistency in each of the two respects, there was a possible explanation. Such matters of speculation, whilst perhaps appropriate for counsel, should not receive the added weight of the intervention of the judicial officer. In each respect the jury could have understood the trial judge to be suggesting that, because there may have been an explanation as a matter of logic, they should not take these matters into account in determining the credibility of the complainant.

[61] In the event, in our opinion, the directions to the jury were, in a critical respect, lacking in the appropriate balance.'

[90] The permissible area within which a trial judge may draw to the jury's attention an argument that was not put by Counsel, was conveniently noted by Hunt CJ at CL in R v Heuston (1995) 81 A Crim R 387 at 393:

'Sometimes, of course, a judge is obliged - even in what might be described as the ordinary case to draw the attention of the jury to an argument which has not been put by counsel, if it is necessary to do so in order to ensure that the jury has sufficient knowledge and understanding of the evidence to discharge their duty to determine the case according to the evidence. Some such occasions are obvious - where, for example, the principal ""defence"" is one of alibi, yet there is clear evidence of intoxication which would be relevant to specific intention in the event that the alibi fails. Everyone realises that, from a tactical point of view, if counsel were to address upon such an issue of intoxication it would weaken the strength of his client's case on alibi, and trial judges should usually discuss the need to give directions as to such matters with counsel (in the absence of the jury) before the summing up commences. Other such occasions are not always so obvious, and - again, stated in very general terms in relation to the ordinary case - there will be no miscarriage of justice if arguments which may have been available on the evidence are not put by the judge in the summing up if they had not already been put by counsel. Sometimes, indeed, it may produce positive mischief if the judge raises arguments which could have been but which were not put or requested by counsel.'

[91] Additionally, occasion might arise for the judge to draw attention to some matter which had not been dealt with by the Crown, where that is necessary to restore a balance to the trial, and where the Crown Prosecutor had no reason to foresee it, or any opportunity to deal with it.

[92] As Blanch CJ also said in R v Malone:

'In this case it is clear that the remarks complained of were made by the trial judge in the context of criticisms made of the Crown case not foreshadowed during the course of the trial and not anticipated by the Crown Prosecutor in his address. This Court has drawn attention before to the fact that judges may find it necessary to become involved in forensic argument insofar as it is necessary to deal with matters raised by defence counsel who make the last address to the jury - see for example R v O""Donoghue (1988) 34 A. Crim. R. 397, R v William Booth, (C.C.A. (N.S.W.) unreported 29 September, 1993 and R v Gluscheski (1987) 33 A. Crim. R. 193.'""


	
	It is important to bear in mind as well that ""in order to determine whether a summing up is unfairly balanced, it is necessary for it to be considered in its entirety and in the context of the issues and the evidence led in the trial"": R v Sukkar [2005] NSWCCA 54 at [90] (Wood CJ at CL).
	


First example - in the context of directing that the Crown does not need to prove the truth of each and every statement of every witness


	
	At an early stage of his summing up, in the context of directing the jury about their role in determining the facts and after having given a relatively elaborate direction that the facts were for the jury alone to determine with the judge having no role to play, his Honour directed the jury concerning the Crown bearing the onus of proof. He then moved to say that this did not mean that the Crown had to prove ""the truth of each and every statement made by each and every Crown witness"" and he foreshadowed that he would be telling the jury about the essential elements of the charges.
	
	
	His Honour told the jury that witnesses to the same event who were doing their best to be truthful and accurate ""might for various reasons not all give the same evidence in all respects"". He then elaborated by speaking about the issue concerning Ms Gorton's recognition of Mr Tombe at the railway station but not at the time of the assault upon Mr Nagy at Walters Road and St Pauls Way:
	


1.   ""It might be expected that witnesses to the same incident will each perceive it differently because of the position they were in at the time, the position of lighting that might have assisted the field of vision of some of them and not others, the level of stress they were experiencing, or their intoxication. Some might have a more or less accurate memory of the event compared with others as time passes. You might expect that they would remember core features of the events or those that were more significant or important to them, discarding or at least not remembering accurately peripheral matters of little consequence.

2.   It is important that you appreciate those matters because a matter of some significance upon which the accused rely in this case is that Ms Gorton went to school with Fadllaseed Tombe, one of the accused, and that she saw him at the railway station. Now, you have the benefit of the video recording of the events on the cab rank outside the railway station and you can gain some appreciation of the lighting that was there installed at the time. It is not the best material upon which to assess lighting but you can see that there is more than one light installed at that location, at least at the time.

3.   Now, in contrast to that, you will see in exhibit B, the photographs, that the lighting is far more limited, and the very first photograph to which you were taken by counsel shows the police car or police van immediately adjacent to a telegraph pole with a single streetlight to the left of St Pauls Way. 

4.   St Pauls Way is where it is said the attack occurred upon Mr Nagy; and further into the exhibit you will see photographs depicting the stains on the footpath which are in an alignment with the brick wall to the north side of St Pauls Way if we accept that St Pauls Way generally runs east and west, those stains being suggested to be bloodstains, the inference available being that the blood was issued from Mr Nagy after he was attacked.

5.   Now, again as a matter of common sense and experience of life, if this was an illuminated area with lots of ambient lighting the opportunity to identify somebody is going to be much improved. But where you have a single streetlight, which might be behind the individuals that are being observed, the capacity to see features of those individuals must be compromised. And you will recall there was some cross-examination of Senior Constable Cook about the lighting, including the streetlight and passing traffic lights and how it might impact upon night vision where one's night vision might reach a certain level, but be compromised by lighting upon which one might come or which might come upon someone as they are in the location.

6.   I express no view one way or the other; I simply bring to your attention these matters to be brought to account in the course of your deliberations when assessing the submissions made as to why Ms Gorton may or may not have been in a position to say whether one of the three assailants was Fadllaseed Tombe at the time Mr Nagy was attacked.""

(In this extract and those below, the italicisation and underlining indicate emphasis, and further emphasis, in the applicant's written submissions. Paragraph numbering has been added for ease of reference.)


	
	That passage was immediately followed by his Honour mentioning the difference between Mr Skordis' evidence in the trial with what an ambulance paramedic said that he told her. (After Mr Skordis was delivered to hospital she completed her paperwork which included writing that ""he was allegedly assaulted by a large group of offenders wielding baseball bats"". She did not have an independent recollection of it; said that it was not verbatim; but agreed he must have said something to that effect.)
	


7.   ""Some witnesses might have a greater or lesser ability to communicate what they remember of the event they are describing. As I explained to you earlier in the trial it is not unusual for people called to give evidence to have been asked to make a statement to police and later, perhaps on more than one occasion, to be called to describe events in a courtroom. Thus you have an event and then a police officer asks questions upon which a statement is prepared in narrative form and which the witness is asked to sign. And then subsequently the witness is asked to give evidence in court.

8.   The witness may or may not have an imperfect memory of the event by the time they come to court and will sometimes be reminded of what they said on earlier occasions. You saw that occur in the course of cross examination here in this trial.

9.   One of the matters brought to your attention was the fact that Mr Skordis is attributed with certain facts by the ambulance officer who recorded a field record of what the event was after she had delivered him to the hospital and whilst she was in her vehicle waiting to depart or go to her next job, I suppose. Counsel made submissions to you about that and you will give those submissions such weight, as you deem appropriate. But do not overlook the fact that what is recorded by that ambulance officer was not a verbatim record of what was said by Mr Skordis. It is what I would refer to as a derivative statement or a conclusion of what she understood Mr Skordis to have said to her in narrative form and in brief form.

10.   So I hope what I have said to you explains why the law does not require the Crown to prove the truth and accuracy of every representation made by every witness called to give evidence in the trial. It would be an impossible task for the Crown to do so. As I have said, what the Crown must prove are the essential elements, which combine to make up the offence in each case and upon which I will instruct you later in this summing-up.""

Submissions


	
	What the judge said about the lighting at St Pauls Way and Walters Road and Ms Gorton not recognising Mr Tombe ([2]-[6] of the extract) was submitted to have been unnecessary in the context of explaining the direction about the Crown not having to prove every statement of every witness. It was submitted that this undermined a key feature of the defence case; indeed the very first submission counsel had made in his closing address to the jury. Counsel in this Court characterised what his Honour said as the expression of ""scepticism or caution about the significance that could be attached to Gorton's omission"" that was highly disadvantageous to the applicant.
	
	
	In relation to what the judge said about the evidence of the ambulance paramedic ([9] of the extract), it was submitted that it was important to the defence case that there were more than three African men present at the scene when Mr Skordis was assaulted. The trial judge undermined the applicant's case in this respect by having ""urged the jury to be cautious before accepting Skordis may have said the words attributed to him by the ambulance officer"".
	
	
	Counsel for the Crown submitted that in relation to Ms Gorton not identifying Mr Tombe at St Pauls Way, the judge was simply pointing out to the jury that in assessing a witness they should take into account the circumstances as established on the evidence. In this case, that included evidence as to the nature of the attack and the lighting. Counsel for both accused had cross-examined Senior Constable Cook who had examined the crime scene where Mr Nagy had been assaulted. Counsel for the applicant obtained his agreement that when he arrived at the scene it was ""very dark"" and that ""there was limited street lighting"". Counsel referred to the concept of a person acquiring ""night vision"" but obtained the officer's agreement that ""it was very dark so with the limited lighting of that street light and the cars that occasionally go past you lose your night vision as well"".
	


Closing address arguments to the jury


	
	In relation to Ms Gorton's evidence that she was not able to recognise any of the men at the scene of the attack on Mr Nagy, the Crown asked that the jury consider all of the circumstances in which she found herself: it was a dark night, there was limited lighting in the street, it was a surprise attack by people of a similar physical appearance who were carrying weapons. It was a situation that was highly traumatic for Ms Gorton. In such circumstances, the Crown submitted that Ms Gorton's ability to identify any of the people present at the attack would have been highly impaired.
	
	
	The defence case was that it was highly significant that Ms Gorton was unable to recognise any of the men present at the assault on Mr Nagy given that she went to school with Mr Tombe and had identified him as being present earlier that evening. Mr Bogan (counsel for the applicant) pointed to Ms Gorton's evidence that she had looked at the men, they were not covering their faces and yet she was unable to identify any of them.
	
	
	In relation to the ambulance paramedic's evidence, counsel for the applicant submitted that evidence that there were a number of men present when Mr Skordis was assaulted was highly relevant. Emphasis was placed upon the words used by the ambulance paramedic in the patient health care record which was completed soon after the paramedic had spoken to Mr Skordis. She recorded that Mr Skordis told her that ""a large group"" of Sudanese men attacked Mr Skordis. The jury was asked to accept this evidence because Mr Skordis ""couldn't have any reason to exaggerate after the event to the ambulance officer"".
	


Consideration


	
	It was not contended that anything the trial judge said was inaccurate or was not based upon the evidence (and this was confirmed by counsel for the applicant in the course of oral argument in this Court). It was clearly relevant for the jury to assess the issue about Ms Gorton not identifying Mr Tombe at St Pauls Way by considering all of the relevant circumstances established by the evidence placed before them by the parties.
	
	
	Later in the summing up his Honour reminded the jury of various submissions which had been made by the prosecutor and defence counsel in their closing addresses concerning Ms Gorton’s non-identification of Tombe. His Honour did not go beyond any argument advanced in the Crown's closing address and, arguably, in summarising the Crown's submissions his Honour was rather cursory. In any event, what he said was balanced by reminding the jury of some of the submissions of counsel for the applicant. There is no suggestion that he said anything to undermine those submissions.
	
	
	There is nothing in the complaint about what the judge said concerning the evidence of what Mr Skordis said to the ambulance paramedic. There was nothing inaccurate about it. His Honour was highlighting for the jury the care which must be taken when assessing evidence of what a person said out of court when there is not a verbatim record. His Honour did not express a view about the evidence of Mr Skordis. It cannot be said that his Honour undermined the defence submissions in these remarks. It should also be noted that later, when summarising the content of closing addresses, his Honour reminded the jury of arguments that had been made concerning conflicts between the evidence of Mr Skordis and witnesses to his assault and prior statements that they had made (see [19] in the extract below]). There is no complaint about what his Honour said on this topic at that point.
	
	
	There is nothing in this ""first example"" that supports the applicant's contention that there was a miscarriage of justice.
	


Second example - in the context of summarising the competing submissions


	
	In the submissions for the applicant the ""second example"" was said to concern the manner in which the judge reviewed the submissions of counsel. When dealing with the Crown's address he explained each of the facts and circumstances of the Crown's circumstantial case without any major qualification to them. Sometimes he prefaced mention of these matters (appropriately in the applicant's submissions) with phrases such as ""the Crown asks you to accept"" or ""the Crown submits that"". It was contended, however, to be significant that the judge concluded this summary by saying:
	


11.   ""In this way the Crown relies upon circumstantial evidence, the most significant of which it would appear to me, ladies and gentlemen, is that there are the assailants on Skordis, they go to the vehicle, the vehicle is recorded. Ms Eastlake confirms it is her vehicle, she confirms that the accused were two of the three passengers in the vehicle with Zakria and she then drove them to a point proximate to where the attack occurred on Mr Nagy.""


	
	The emphasised words were submitted by the applicant to have had the effect of conveying to the jury that the trial judge recognised the persuasive force of those strands of the Crown's circumstantial case. They were unnecessary words but were disadvantageous to the applicant. Moreover, there was no particular defence submission that was identified by the judge has holding such special significance.
	


Closing address arguments to the jury


	
	The Crown emphasised that the most important aspect of its circumstantial case was the evidence of people moving to and from Ms Eastlake's vehicle at the relevant times. This was made clear to the jury: ""the important point, as I said, is the linkage between the people who attacked Michael Skordis with weapons and that vehicle …"".
	


Consideration


	
	The contention that the judge was conveying that he recognised the persuasive force of the Crown's submission must rejected. It ignores the terms of the Crown closing address. The Crown Prosecutor had made it plain that the matter that the judge mentioned in the passage in question was the lynch pin of the case identifying the accused as the assailants of both Mr Skordis and Mr Nagy. I am not persuaded that the jury would have interpreted what the judge said as a personal opinion as to the merit of the Crown's submission; it was simply an observation that this was the main point (""the most significant point"") relied upon by the Crown.
	


No fingerprints found on boot of Ms Eastlake's car and no blood or DNA inside it


	
	The next complaint concerns the following passage which appears in the course of his Honour's review of the defence submissions:
	


12.   ""He [counsel for the applicant] then asked rhetorically where could the weapons have come from for use by the accused and Mr Zakria if they were the assailants in each case. There was no one who saw them with weapons at all if they were not the persons responsible for these attacks. Indeed, he said no one sees them with weapons at all before these events. He reminded you that Yasmine Eastlake's evidence regarding the slamming of the boot was qualified. There was no fingerprint evidence or evidence of any fingerprint impression left near to the boot notwithstanding that they found fingerprint impressions elsewhere on the vehicle.

13.   There was no evidence before you to explain how that might or might not have occurred or whether the vehicle was out in the elements that might have impacted upon such evidence but it is the fact that there was no fingerprint evidence harvested from that point.

14.   It was said that there was no evidence of Matthew Nagy's blood found in the car. Well, that is so; there was no evidence of any tissue with a DNA profile matching any of the accused or either one of the complainants.

15.   There was some DNA material that was too small a quantity to be able to reveal a DNA profile so that evidence really is neither here nor there. I would invite you to put that entirely to one side as not being of any assistance to you at all.

16.   It was said to you that you would expect there to be blood transferred from the scene of the attack on Mr Nagy into the vehicle by use of the weapons if these accused were participants in this event. Ladies and gentlemen, much would depend upon that. Much would depend upon whether or not the weapons had picked up any of Mr Nagy's blood bearing in mind that he has it appears one laceration to his skull consistent with one blow to the skull out of the twenty.

17.   And there could be any number of explanations for there to be no transference of any blood tissue from the attack into the vehicle. You would not speculate in the circumstances where the evidence is, you might think, entirely silent upon that point. It was perhaps suggesting matters at a too high a level to say that you would expect there to be a transference of blood in light of the dearth of evidence upon that point. 

…

18.   I do not propose to go into the evidence of those witnesses in detail. Counsel for the accused and the Crown for that matter have done so urging you to the view that you, first of all on the Crown side, you would accept their evidence with regard to core matters as reliable and trustworthy. And Mr Stitz [counsel for Tombe] and Mr Bogan, of course, reminded you of the burden of proof being with the Crown to the standard beyond reasonable doubt upon which I have already directed you.

19.   Mr Stitz took you to exhibit A and through the courses of travel that were available by looking at that street map. He reminded you of the risk of resulting impairment from alcohol that the witnesses might have suffered. And again he took you to the triple-0 calls and reasons why they might be unreliable. And both counsel reminded you that evidence given in this trial stood in contrast to some aspects to what these witnesses had said on earlier occasions, when they were taken back to other occasions when they gave evidence, and also the content of their statements.

20.   Counsel took you to pages and read you the evidence. I do not propose to go through the same exercise.

21.   A point the Crown made which I believe you should not overlook is that these events were not static; they were an evolving sequence and these witnesses were all not in the same location. You should bear in mind that they are describing what they claim to have seen as those events were unfolding. They might not have all been looking at the same thing at the same time."" (Emphasis in applicant's submissions)


	
	It was submitted that this ""continuous adding of qualifications to the defence submissions discredited the defence case"" and that ""the contrast between the two summaries demonstrates a lack of balance.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that far from undermining the defence submission that there was no evidence of Mr Nagy's blood in the car, the trial judge confirmed that that submission was in accordance with the evidence. However, with respect to the submission that the jury might ""expect there to be blood transferred"" the trial judge appropriately, in the Crown's submission, directed the jury not to speculate in light of the absence of evidence as to the likelihood of transference.
	


Closing address arguments to the jury


	
	The Crown acknowledged that there was no DNA evidence linking either accused to the crime scene, but asked the jury not to draw any adverse inferences from that fact. The prosecutor reminded the jury that in relation to Mr Nagy's head injury and the resultant bleeding, ""a lot of it is internal bleeding, not external bleeding"". He also reminded the jury that for most of the attack Mr Nagy was lying on the ground; that explained blood staining on the ground and would make less likely that blood would have been directed towards the assailants. As a result, it was very possible that no blood was transferred onto the assailants or their weapons and then transferred to Ms Eastlake's car.
	
	
	Counsel for the applicant submitted that in circumstances where Mr Nagy was ""hit at least 20 times"" and was ""bleeding heavily"" ""… you would expect to find some evidence of blood after the car is subjected to extensive forensic testing"". It was also suggested that ""there must have been blood on those weapons that were used to assault Mr Nagy"".
	
	
	When that submission was challenged by the Crown (in the absence of the jury), Mr Bogan maintained that it was open to the jury to find that, given the nature of the attack, ""there must have been blood all over those weapons"". The trial judge indicated his disagreement with that submission and said he would remind the jury of the evidence relevant to it.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that it was Ms Eastlake's evidence that she heard the boot slam when the three men got out of her car in Walters Road. The Crown contended that this meant that ""clearly that boot was opened by somebody … by Mr Majok"". The jury was asked to accept Ms Eastlake's evidence that the three men went to the boot, which ""can indicate nothing but that they wanted to get something out of the boot"".
	
	
	Counsel for the applicant pointed out (correctly) that Ms Eastlake's evidence regarding the slamming of the boot was not definitive: ""She doesn't say she knows it happened, she doesn't say that it did happen. All she says is she thinks so in response to a question as to whether it happened … we don't know whether maybe it's simply that she heard car doors slamming and assumed that the boot has slammed as well"". Mr Bogan highlighted that while fingerprints were located on Ms Eastlake's car, there were no fingerprints on the boot.
	


Consideration


	
	At the conclusion of the summing up, counsel for the applicant raised four matters that he considered required correction. The first concerned what turned out to be counsel's misunderstanding of what the judge had said about the Crown case being that there were three assailants. No correction was required. The second matter concerned there being nothing conclusive in terms of DNA found on Zakria's clothing. The judge felt he had adequately dealt with this and did not consider it should be given prominence by revisiting it. The third matter concerned his Honour's comments about speculation on the subject of blood transference onto weapons. The judge declined to say anything more to the jury because there was no evidence on the subject. The fourth matter concerned the judge having referred to the lighting in relation to Ms Gorton's non-recognition of Mr Tombe at the scene of the attack upon Mr Nagy. The judge responded to the effect that what he had said was just commonsense.
	
	
	The comment made by the judge about there being no explanation in relation to the (lack of) fingerprints issue ([13] in the extract) was not a submission that had been made by the prosecutor. There was no complaint made to the trial judge about the comment. With the benefit of hindsight, it might have suggested to the jury that the lack of any fingerprints near the boot of the car (from where the Crown suggested that weapons were obtained) did not detract from the Crown case. The true position was that it did not support the Crown case. But the fact that counsel did not perceive anything detrimental to the defence case, in the context of him having raised other complaints, suggests that the matter did not have the significance it is now suggested to have.
	
	
	The matter given emphasis by the applicant in [14] of the extract has no significance. It was an entirely neutral matter and what the judge said was an endorsement of a defence submission.
	
	
	The matter highlighted by the applicant in [16]-[17] of the extract was the subject of complaint at the trial. But the judge was correct to point out that it was a matter of speculation whether transference might or could be expected. Counsel for the applicant had been quite excessive in his address to the jury on this topic. For example, he said that Mr Nagy ""was bleeding heavily and there must have been blood on those weapons""; ""we know that there was a lot of blood that was produced""; ""he's hit at least 20 times and there's all this blood""; and ""those weapons would have had a lot of blood on them"". The evidence simply did not support such submissions. Mr Nagy sustained only the one wound and the blood stains seen in the area where he fell was relatively meagre (see Exhibit B). In these circumstances, it was necessary for something to be said to the jury to correct the wrong impression conveyed on behalf of the applicant and to avoid the jury engaging in speculation.
	
	
	The matter highlighted by the applicant in the final paragraph of the extract was a valid reminder of a significant matter for the jury to take into account.
	


Conclusion


	
	I am not persuaded that any of the specific matters identified in the submissions for the applicant looked at in isolation or in combination, and in the context of the entirety of the summing up, support the contention that the summing up was productive of a miscarriage of justice.
	
	
	Rule 4 applies in respect of most of the points sought to be raised. The only matter relied upon that was raised at trial concerned the comment made by the judge about the possibility of blood transference to the weapons used by the assailants and then to Ms Eastlake's car. That point arose from the lack of evidence and the excesses of counsel for the applicant's closing address to the jury. It had no merit. The other points that were sought to be raised for the first time in this Court lacked merit as well. For these reasons I favour a refusal of leave to appeal.
	


Orders


	
	I propose the following orders:
	


1   Time to file Notice of Application for Leave to Appeal extended to 19 January 2015.

2   Leave to appeal against conviction refused.

	HOEBEN CJ at CL:
	


Offences and sentence

The applicant seeks leave to appeal from the sentences imposed by Wilson SC DCJ on 30 July 2014 following a trial in the Newcastle District Court from 12 – 24 June 2014.


	
	The applicant was found guilty of one count of driving in a manner dangerous occasioning death, contrary to s 52A(1)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900, for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 10 years. The victim was the pillion passenger on a Suzuki motorcycle ridden by the applicant which collided with a parked car. This caused the victim to be flung from the bike to his death on 25 April 2011. The applicant was under the influence of intoxicating liquor at the time.
	
	
	On 30 July 2014 the applicant was sentenced to imprisonment with a non-parole period of 2 years and 7 months, commencing 21 July 2014 and expiring 20 February 2017, with a balance of term of 11 months expiring 20 January 2018. In addition the applicant was disqualified from driving for 4 years commencing 30 July 2014 and expiring 29 July 2018.
	
	
	The applicant seeks leave to appeal from that sentence on the following grounds:
	


Ground 1 – Her Honour erred in her assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence.

Ground 2 – Her Honour erred in failing to find special circumstances.

Ground 3 – Her Honour was in error in finding the amelioration of the sentence due to delay in the prosecution of the matter must be small given the criminality assessed by the court.

Ground 4 – The sentence imposed was manifestly excessive.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND


	
	On 25 April 2011 the applicant finished his shift as a train driver at 7am and after getting some sleep joined friends, including the deceased Adam Ryan, at the Toronto Hotel. The applicant was a close friend of the deceased whom he regarded as something of an older brother figure. The two men were drinking alcohol at the hotel. After some hours, the applicant and the deceased went to the Toronto Workers Club where they continued to drink. They left the Club at about 8.30pm with the applicant’s fiancée driving them to the applicant’s home. By that stage the applicant had been drinking since about midday.
	
	
	The applicant and the deceased remained at his home for a time but then decided to travel by motorcycle to West Wallsend, a distance of about 10 kms, where a mutual friend was hosting Anzac Day drinks. The motorcycle used by the applicant was a Suzuki dirt bike, which belonged to his brother.
	
	
	It was common ground that motorcycles of this type were not intended for use on public roads. The bike had no headlight, no indicator lights, no mirrors and no footrest for a pillion passenger. The tyres with which it was fitted were unsuitable for highway use. It was accepted that the bike was not roadworthy in the sense that it could not because of these deficiencies be registered for safe use on a public street in New South Wales. The applicant was not licensed to ride a motorcycle.
	
	
	The night was dark, it being after 9pm. It had been raining and there was still light rain falling from time to time. Neither the applicant nor the deceased wore a helmet. The applicant had some difficulty in starting the motorcycle so that it was the deceased who ultimately was successful in starting it. Once the motorcycle had been successfully started, the applicant commenced to drive it with the deceased as a pillion passenger.
	
	
	Because the applicant had no recollection of precisely how the accident occurred, the evidence on that issue was given by various eyewitnesses. Not far from where the journey commenced, the motorbike collided with a parked car. The impact was such that the car was propelled a short distance along the road. The motorcycle collided with the rear driver’s side of the car causing the applicant and the deceased to be ejected from the bike onto the road surface. The applicant was also on the roadway very near the bike and the deceased was further away from the bike. Bystanders tried unsuccessfully to revive the deceased but he died at the scene of the accident.
	
	
	The applicant was injured in the collision and suffered a fracture to the left side of his pelvis, along with some minor abrasions. The injury required surgical repair and the applicant spent a month in hospital followed by rehabilitation. The applicant told bystanders, police and ambulance officers at the scene of the accident that he was the driver of the motorcycle. Subsequently the issue at trial was whether the applicant or the deceased was the driver of the motorcycle. As indicated, that issue was decided against the applicant.
	
	
	The applicant had been drinking beer and spirits until shortly before the accident. A blood sample obtained from him at 10.45pm on the night of the accident revealed a blood alcohol reading of .124 grams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood. There was expert evidence that with such a reading, the driving skills of all people would be significantly impaired, but the skills of a younger driver would be impaired substantially. This was because a younger driver would be less likely than an older individual to be experienced either as a drinker or as a driver and the effect of alcohol upon such an individual would be greater. The expert evidence was that a driver’s perceptions, judgment, visual functioning and information processing would all be impaired in a person with a blood alcohol reading of .124. Such a person’s motor skills, co-ordination and reaction skills would also be significantly impaired.
	


Sentence proceedings


	
	Having reviewed the facts, her Honour considered the objective gravity of the offence and the degree of moral culpability of the applicant. In doing so, her Honour had regard to the guideline judgment in R v Whyte [2002] NSWCCA 343; 55 NSWLR 252. Her Honour noted that in accordance with that guideline judgment, the applicant was a young offender, a person of good character with no prior convictions, that death had been caused to a single person and that there was genuine remorse. Insofar as aggravating features were concerned, her Honour noted that the matter of aggravation was the degree of intoxication of the applicant. Her Honour concluded by reference to the expert evidence that the applicant at the time of the accident was very significantly intoxicated and that his driving ability was substantially impaired. Her Honour was of the opinion that the level of impairment of the applicant greatly increased the dangerousness of his conduct.
	
	
	Her Honour enumerated the other dangerous features of the applicant’s conduct. He chose to use a motorcycle that was not registered because it was neither designed nor safe for highway use. The journey was intended to be a relatively lengthy one and was knowingly undertaken on a dark and rainy night on a bike with no headlight. The applicant allowed a pillion passenger to join him even though the bike had no suitable foot rest for such a passenger and was plainly not designed for two riders. Her Honour noted that the applicant allowed his pillion passenger to undertake the journey without the protection of a helmet. This was significant because the fatal injuries suffered by the deceased were head injuries.
	
	
	Her Honour set out her conclusions as follows:
	


“In my view, the moral culpability of the offender for Mr Ryan’s death is very high indeed.

The Crown has urged the Court to find that the offender’s moral culpability is such that he abandoned responsibility for his own conduct. Having regard to the conjunction of features involved, that is a conclusion that I must reach.” (ROS 12.8)


	
	Her Honour then reviewed the applicant’s subjective case which was a strong one. She found the applicant to be a young man of good character (he was aged 18 at the time). He had been fully employed since completing his schooling and had gained the appropriate qualification to drive trains and had obtained fulltime employment in that occupation. The applicant was living with his fiancée, who gave evidence on his behalf, and who impressed her Honour as an honest and upstanding young woman who was providing the applicant with a stable and loving relationship and strong support. Her Honour referred to a number of glowing testimonials which had been placed before the court, which indicated the very high opinion which persons in the community had of the applicant. Her Honour noted that each of those persons who wrote a reference commented upon the impact that the crash and the loss of a close friend had had on the applicant. Her Honour found that the applicant had the significant benefit of a supportive family who would give him every assistance on his release from custody.
	
	
	The applicant gave evidence in the sentence proceedings. In relation to that evidence her Honour said:
	


“… it is clear that he has been terribly affected by the crash and the death of Adam Ryan. Without objection from the Crown, the offender read from a statement that he had written, a copy of which was marked for identification 3. In that statement he expressed his sorrow for the death of Adam Ryan, a young man he looked upon as a best friend and older brother figure. I do not doubt the sincerity of his feelings or the genuineness of his grief. Indeed, in reading his statement, the offender frequently broke down, sobs wracking his body.” (ROS 17.9)


	
	Her Honour found that the applicant had accepted responsibility for the deceased’s death and that his remorse was genuine. Her Honour noted that the applicant had recently received some counselling to assist him to deal with his grief, as well as his anxiety about the legal proceedings. Her Honour set out her conclusion on this issue as follows:
	


“I have, however, taken into account the offender’s grief at the death of his close friend, and the terrible feelings of guilt and self-blame he has experienced and expressed, to the extent that that is possible, given what I have assessed as the high level of the offender’s moral culpability.” (ROS 14.9)


	
	Her Honour was well aware of the delay which had occurred between the offence and proceedings being commenced against the applicant. On this issue, her Honour found:
	


“In determining the sentence to be imposed upon the offender, I have taken into account the delay in mounting the prosecution of the offender. The crash which killed Mr Ryan occurred on 25 April 2011, but the offender was not brought before a court to face any charge until 5 September 2012. Since the prosecuting authorities had evidence at an early stage of the admissions the offender made to those at the scene, the basis of the delay is not entirely clear. There was some additional delay in bringing the matter to trial because of the unavailability for a time of a Crown witness.

Whilst I do not doubt that this delay has caused additional stress and anxiety to the offender, and I have taken that into account in mitigation of sentence, the degree of amelioration in that regard must be small, given the criminality as assessed by the Court.” (ROS 15.4)


	
	In relation to rehabilitation, her Honour found:
	


“The offender’s counsel submitted to the Court that Mr Casey’s prospects of rehabilitation were strongly positive, and I accept that that is so. His former good character, his profession as a train driver and his solid work history, his supportive family, and the terrible lesson he has learnt from this crime, all point to a strong likelihood that the offender will never again offend in this, or in any other way.

Whilst the offender submitted that the Court should find that there are special circumstances to justify a variation in the usual ratio of sentence, I am not persuaded that that is so, and I make no finding in that regard.

It was submitted on the offender’s behalf that he will need a longer period of parole than would apply in the usual course to assist him with the issues surrounding binge drinking and grief management, but the evidence for that is relatively limited. It is of some significance that the offender took no formal steps to address these issues until after his trial.

Special circumstances should be in fact special. There should additionally be some clear evidence of progress in the relevant areas, such that an extended parole period can be seen to be likely to achieve an offender’s rehabilitation. There is no evidence in the present case to justify such a conclusion.

It seems to me that the parole period that will flow as a natural consequence of sentence will be sufficient.” (ROS 15.8 – 16.5)

THE APPEAL

Ground 1 – Her Honour erred in her assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence.


	
	The applicant submitted that when assessing the objective seriousness of the offending and his moral culpability, her Honour overlooked a relevant factor, i.e. that the activity which led to the death of the deceased was in fact a joint enterprise entered into by both of them. He submitted that they had spent much of the day drinking together and that the decision to go to the party using the bike was one jointly made, even to the extent of the deceased being the person who was able to start the motorcycle. The applicant submitted that both he and the deceased were involved in all decisions leading to the accident.
	
	
	In making that submission the applicant accepted that in R v Errington [1999] NSWCCA 18 the Court (Grove, Dunford and Greg James JJ) at [27] – [28] found that the actions of the victim cannot be a mitigating factor in an offence under s 52A of the Crimes Act. In that case the victim had been drinking heavily and had travelled willingly in a motor vehicle with someone she must have known was grossly intoxicated. However, the applicant also relied upon the decisions in R v Whelan [2004] NSWCCA 379 and R v Janceski [2005] NSWCCA 288 as supporting the submission. In R v Whelan the Court accepted that the sentencing judge was entitled to take into account the actions of another driver, who had made an extremely dangerous right hand turn across oncoming traffic into the offender’s path, in circumstances where the offender’s ability to control his own vehicle was significantly affected by his own intoxication. In Janceski Hunt AJA (with whom Spigelman CJ and Howie J agreed) considered those cases and said:
	


“28   Both cases are extreme examples. It is clearly incorrect to take the culpability of the victim into account in mitigation. The judge did not say expressly that he was taking that fact into account in mitigation …

29    The culpability of the victim will usually be relevant to the assessment of the seriousness of the offender’s conduct, and therefore to the offender’s culpability. …”


	
	The applicant submitted that there was error in failing to take this aspect of the factual circumstances into account, and that her Honour overlooked a relevant factor when assessing the objective seriousness of the offence and the applicant’s moral culpability.
	


Consideration


	
	An initial difficulty for the applicant is that this issue was not raised on behalf of the applicant in the sentence proceedings. In those circumstances, it is not appropriate to say that her Honour “overlooked” this issue. This Court has repeatedly said that a sentencing appeal is not an opportunity to reformulate arguments and that parties should be bound by the submissions made and evidence led in the lower court.
	
	
	This principle was recently restated in Zreika v R [2012] NSWCCA 44; 223 A Crim R 460 where Johnson J (with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Rothman J agreed) said:
	


“80   There is a practical expectation that an offender's legal representative will make submissions to the sentencing Judge at first instance, by reference to the particular factors which are sought to be taken into account in mitigation of sentence in the case at hand: Edwards v R [2009] NSWCCA 199 at [11]; Dyer v R [2011] NSWCCA 185 at [49]. …

81   The Victorian Court of Appeal has emphasised recently, that in sentencing appeals, the Court is reviewing the exercise of a discretionary judgment and not rehearing a plea of mitigation. It is not the occasion for the revision and reformulation of the case presented below. The Court will not lightly entertain arguments that could have been put, but were not advanced on the plea, and will have an even greater reluctance to entertain arguments that seek to resile from concessions made below or are a contradiction of submissions previously made. The Court spoke of the need for exceptional circumstances before this can be done, where it can be shown that there was most compelling material available on the plea that was not used or understood, and which demonstrates that there has been a miscarriage of justice arising from the plea and sentence: Romero v R [2011] VSCA 45 at [11]; Keane v R [2011] VSCA 156 at [13],[18]; Bayram v R [2012] VSCA 6 at [28]-[29].”


	
	Leaving aside the important issue raised by Zreika, there is little substance in this ground of appeal. Janceski was a Crown appeal in which the respondent was driving a motor vehicle when his passenger recognised another vehicle driving past as one which had been stolen from a friend. This resulted in a high speed car chase in the course of which the driver of the stolen vehicle lost control and he and his passenger were killed. On those facts one can see why the court expressed the opinion which it did.
	
	
	The facts of this case are more in accord with, though more culpable than, those in Errington. This was a case where the applicant’s moral culpability was high because he was aware that his passenger was very intoxicated and therefore much less likely to be able to hold on if there were any kind of accident. As driver he took responsibility for his passenger knowing that the passenger was in a highly intoxicated state. In those circumstances, the state of intoxication of the deceased increased the dangers associated with driving the motor cycle.
	
	
	It follows that on the facts of this case, taking into account the highly intoxicated state of the deceased, her Honour’s finding of a high level of moral culpability on the part of the applicant was well open to her. This is particularly so when counsel for the applicant on the sentence proceedings accepted that the applicant’s conduct took him “to the threshold of abandonment of responsibility”.
	
	
	This ground of appeal has not been made out.
	


Ground 2 – Her Honour erred in failing to find special circumstances.


	
	The applicant submitted that her Honour erred when she refused to make a finding of special circumstances on the basis that there was relatively limited evidence as to the likelihood of him successfully dealing with “the issues surrounding binge drinking and grief management”. He submitted that there were significant and positive signs which showed that if he were allowed a longer period on parole, rehabilitation was likely to be successful.
	
	
	The applicant referred to the evidence accepted by her Honour as to the genuineness of his anxiety and unresolved grief resulting from the death of the deceased. There was evidence that he had reduced his alcohol consumption after the accident and was highly motivated to address his problem drinking. There was the evidence that he had commenced counselling in relation to these issues. There was evidence as to the support provided to him by his partner and by his family. The applicant relied on the opinion in the pre-sentence report that his counselling with a local psychologist was an indication that he had a level of insight into his problem.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that the effect of this evidence was to demonstrate significant and positive signs that if he were allowed a longer period on parole, he was likely to resolve those issues. He submitted that in those circumstances, a finding of special circumstances was appropriate. He submitted that her Honour’s error was in failing to find that special circumstances existed.
	


Consideration


	
	The question of rehabilitation, and therefore a consequential finding of special circumstances, was largely otiose in this case. This is because her Honour found as a fact that the applicant’s prospects of rehabilitation were strongly positive, that he had learnt the terrible lesson from this crime and that there was a strong likelihood that the applicant would never again offend in this or in any other way. In other words, in relation to rehabilitation generally, her Honour was satisfied that this had been achieved. Accordingly, there was no need to allow further time for that process to take place.
	
	
	In relation to whether an additional period on parole would assist the applicant in dealing with his alcohol problem and grief reaction, his own evidence was not particularly convincing and was consistent with her Honour’s finding:
	


“Q. All right you did continue drinking after this collision on 25 April 2011?

A. Yes.

Q. Your pattern of drinking didn’t immediately change, did it?

A. No. Well I work most times during the week so I don’t drink during the week I only drink if I’ve got an off weekend.

Q. Yes. You said that you hope for some help with your alcohol consumption. What did you mean by that?

A. Well maybe I need help to stop drinking.

Q. Had you really given that issue much thought before coming to court to give evidence about your sentence?

A. Not really, no.

Q. Because it’s not one of the issues that you were going to see the counsellor about was it?

A. Well we haven’t fully got into detail about everything yet.

…

Q. I see you haven’t raised that with the counsellor yet?

A. No.” (T.24, 21 July 2014)


	
	In relation to the applicant dealing with his grief for the loss of his friend, the highest it was put by the psychologist was that he “would benefit from grief and loss counselling”. She recommended that he continue counselling to address “any unresolved or complex grief issues”.
	
	
	Against that background her Honour’s finding as to the limited nature of the evidence and that no steps were taken to address those two issues until after his trial, was well open to her. No error in her Honour’s fact finding on this issue has been established.
	
	
	Whether the ratio of the non-parole period to head sentence should be adjusted to less than the 75% prescribed by s 44(2) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 involves a “discretionary finding of fact” in respect of which this Court will be slow to intervene: Jiang v R [2010] NSWCCA 277 at [83]; Caristo v R [2011] NSWCCA 7 at [27]. The decision to find special circumstances is first one of fact to identify the circumstances and secondly, one of judgment to determine that those circumstances justify a lowering of the non-parole period below the statutory ratio: R v Simpson [2001] NSWCCA 534; 53 NSWLR 704 at [73].
	
	
	The presence of circumstances which are capable of constituting special circumstances does not compel the Court to make such a finding and reduce the non-parole period: R v Fidow [2004] NSWCCA 172 at [22]. The degree or extent of any adjustment of the “statutory ratio” is a matter for the discretion of the sentencing judge: R v Cramp [2004] NSWCCA 264 at [31]; Trad v R [2009] NSWCCA 56; 194 A Crim R 20 at [33]; MD v R [2015] NSWCCA 37 at [38]. It follows that no error has been identified in her Honour’s finding or approach to special circumstances.
	
	
	This ground of appeal has not been made out.
	


Ground 3 – Her Honour was in error in finding the amelioration of the sentence due to delay in the prosecution of the matter must be small given the criminality assessed by the court.


	
	The applicant submitted that her Honour’s finding “whilst I do not doubt that this delay has caused additional stress and anxiety to the offender and I have taken that into account in mitigation of sentence, the degree of amelioration in that regard must be small given the criminality as assessed by the court” wrongly fettered her sentencing discretion so that the discretion miscarried. The applicant submitted that there was no rule of law which prevented significant leniency being extended to an offender where there had been delay in prosecuting notwithstanding that the offence was serious.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that delay was an important consideration in sentencing. He relied upon R v Blanco [1999] NSWCCA 121; 106 A Crim R 303 where Wood CJ at CL (with whom Bell J and Smart AJ agreed) said:
	


“16    The reason why delay is to be taken into account when sentencing an offender relates first to the fact of the uncertain suspense in which a person may be left; secondly to any demonstrated progress of the offender towards rehabilitation during the intervening period; and thirdly, to the fact that a sentence for a stale crime does call for a measure of understanding and flexibility of approach: See, in addition to Todd and Mill, the decisions in Harrison (1990) 48 A Crim R 197 at 198-199 and King (Court of Criminal Appeal NSW, 24 February 1998).”


	
	The applicant submitted that in this case there had been a significant delay in the order of 18 months from the time of the accident until the time that he was first charged with the offence. He submitted that as in Blanco, there had been no explanation for the delay. Her Honour had accepted that the delay caused additional stress and anxiety. He submitted that while the objective criminality of an offence remained important, it did not restrict or prevent the exercise of the discretion of the sentencing judge to mitigate a sentence if there has been significant delay in the prosecution of the matter.
	


Consideration


	
	The applicant’s submissions depend upon a particular reading of what her Honour said. I do not so read her Honour’s findings. It is clear from the language used and the context, that her Honour was using emphatic, rather than prescriptive, language. The weight given by her Honour to the adverse consequences of delay on the applicant and her assessment of the seriousness of the offence were both part of the exercise of the same sentencing discretion. The “instinctive synthesis” referred to by McHugh J in Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at [66] and subsequently approved on many occasions by the High Court, involves the very process carried out by her Honour, i.e. identifying the principles to be taken into account and having done so, specifying an outcome without engaging in some kind of staged process.
	
	
	In this case the delay of approximately 16½ months was regrettable and unexplained but was certainly not as long as that which occurred in Blanco and the other cases on which the applicant relied. In any event, her Honour did not ignore the fact of delay. Rather, her Honour took it into account but when also taking into account the objective seriousness of the offending her Honour found that its ameliorative effect was limited. The extent to which her Honour took delay into account, was a matter of discretion. It has not been demonstrated that this exercise of discretion miscarried.
	
	
	This ground of appeal has not been made out.
	


Ground 4 – The sentence imposed was manifestly excessive.


	
	In support of this ground, the applicant relied upon two propositions. The first was that proper weight had not been given by her Honour to his very strong subjective case. In that regard, the applicant submitted that her Honour had improperly restricted the weight which she gave to his subjective case when she said:
	


“Whilst the offender has a very positive subjective case, and there is good reason to consider that this will be the only time he ever contravenes the criminal law in such a serious way, neither youth nor good character, nor a strong subjective case, can have significant weight in mitigation of the penalty in cases of this nature.

The sentence must be seen to have a reasonable proportionality to the objective circumstances of the crime, and persuasive subjective circumstances must not lead to inadequate weight being given to those objective circumstances.” (ROS 16.6)


	
	The second proposition relied on by the applicant was that her Honour had failed to take into account the extra-curial punishment experienced by him in that he had been “terribly affected by the death of Adam Ryan, a young man he looked upon as a best friend, an older brother figure”. (ROS 13.8) The applicant submitted that the psychological impact of the responsibility for the death of a friend could in an offence under s 52A Crimes Act 1900 amount to extra-curial punishment (R v Howcher [2004] NSWCCA 179; 146 A Crim R 371 at [16] and [18]). The applicant submitted that this is what had occurred here but her Honour had not taken it into account.
	


Consideration


	
	The submission that her Honour had improperly restricted the weight which she gave to the applicant’s strong subjective case is to misunderstand the rationale behind her Honour’s remarks. Following upon and in support of the passage relied upon by the applicant was the following quote from Hunt CJ at CL (McInerney and Hulme JJ agreeing) in R v Musumeci (unreported, NSWCCA, 30 October 1997):
	


“It is never easy to send a youthful person of good character to gaol, but where it is appropriate, it is something which must be done as a deterrent to others. The need for public deterrence will usually outweigh the fact that the particular offender has already learned his or her lesson. Also, retribution remains an important purpose which the sentence must serve. That is particularly so where the offence is one which involves the use of alcohol.”

When looked at in context, there was no error in her Honour’s approach.


	
	In relation to the second proposition, counsel for the applicant on sentence did not raise the issue of extra-curial punishment and made no submissions in relation to it. As already indicated, the decision in Zreika gives rise to a significant difficulty for the success of this submission.
	
	
	There are, however, other difficulties preventing the applicant succeeding on this submission. In Alameddine v Regina [2006] NSWCCA 317 at [10] – [20] the principles relating to extra-curial punishment were reviewed by Grove, Kirby and Hislop JJ. The effect of that review was that a distinction is to be made between situations where the extra-curial punishment was caused by external forces and those triggered by the offender’s own actions. Such an example is that in R v Allpass (1993) 72 A Crim R 561 where the offender was subjected to a campaign of abuse and harassment following publication of a sentence for a sexual crime against a young girl by an elderly man. That is not the situation here. The death of the deceased was a direct consequence of the applicant’s actions and was an integral part of the offending.
	
	
	In any event, even though her Honour did not consider the applicant’s grief under the heading of extra-curial punishment, she took it into account as an important part of the applicant’s subjective case. It was certainly not ignored. The remarks set out at [16] make that abundantly clear.
	
	
	It follows that the two propositions upon which this ground is based have not been made out and that this ground of appeal fails.
	
	
	The orders which I propose are:
	



	
	Leave to appeal be granted.
	
	
	The appeal be dismissed.
	



	
	HIDDEN J: I have had the benefit of reading in draft the reasons of Hoeben CJ at CL. A tragic case such as this presents a judge with a very difficult sentencing exercise. I can detect no error in her Honour’s approach. None of the grounds of appeal has been made out, and I agree with the orders proposed by the Chief Judge.
	
	
	ADAMS J: I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.

2703236,R v Skuthorpe [2015] NSWCCA 140,"Judgment


	
	HOEBEN CJ at CL: I agree with Hidden J.
	
	
	HIDDEN J: This is an appeal by the Director of Public Prosecutions, pursuant to s 5DA of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, on the basis that the respondent failed to honour an undertaking to provide assistance to the authorities, for which he had received a benefit on sentence. Section 5DA relevantly provides:
	


“(1)   The Attorney General or the Director of Public Prosecutions may appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal against any sentence imposed on a person that was reduced because the person undertook to assist law enforcement authorities if the person fails wholly or partly to fulfil the undertaking.

(2)   On an appeal the Court of Criminal Appeal may, if it is satisfied that the person has failed wholly or partly to fulfil the undertaking, vary the sentence and impose such sentence as it thinks fit.

                                                                                           … .”


	
	The respondent pleaded guilty in the Newcastle District Court to an offence of aggravated sexual intercourse without consent. He signed an agreed statement of facts, the effect of which can be stated briefly. The offence took place in an inner city Newcastle park. The respondent had penile/vaginal intercourse with the complainant over her resistance. Another man, who was with him, put his penis into her mouth and his finger into her vagina. Both men were strangers to her.
	
	
	The respondent was sentenced to imprisonment for 7 ½ years with a non-parole period of 5 years, after the sentencing judge had allowed a combined discount for his plea of guilty and assistance to the authorities. It is that discount which is at the heart of this appeal.
	
	
	When he was arrested, the applicant told police in a recorded interview that there had been an encounter with the complainant, but he denied having had intercourse with her. It appears from the statement of facts that DNA consistent with his had been detected on a vaginal smear taken from the complainant, but there was no evidence of the identity of the other man said to be involved. In the interview the respondent revealed that he had been in the company of a man said to be his cousin, Darren Nean. However, the effect of his account was that Mr Nean had not been in the park at the relevant time and had not had any sexual contact with the complainant. A warrant was issued for Mr Nean’s arrest, but at the time the respondent was sentenced it had not been executed.
	
	
	The respondent gave evidence in the sentence proceedings. This included the following (in-chief):
	


“Q.   The Crown told his Honour earlier on that during the course of your interview you identified the other person who was with you to the police?

A.   Yep.

Q.   Is that something – is assisting the police something that you’re still willing to do in relation to the other person that was with you if they require you, for instance, to give some evidence?

A.   Yeah, I would be happy to give evidence against the witness – ah, the co-accused.

HIS HONOUR

Q.   By saying what? What would you say that person did?

A.     I would tell him the truth, what exactly what I tell youse.

Q.   Well, tell me, tell everyone here in court what you would say y   our cousin - what’s his name?

A.    Darren Nean.

Q   Yeah, what he would do - sorry, what he did. What evidence would you give?

A.   What he did? He was with the girl at the same time I was with her and he had sexual intercourse with her.

Q.   In what form?

A.   Anal. Anal sex with her and--

Q.   Where were you when that happened?

A.   I was there with them.

Q.   Did you see it?

A.   Yep.

Q.   And what about other forms of - oral intercourse?

A.   Sorry?

Q.   Any oral intercourse? Did he have oral intercourse?

A.   No, just - I just had oral and he had, ah--

Q.   Beg your pardon?

A.   Oh, he had oral intercourse, yeah.

Q.   He did?

A.   Yeah.”

(Emphasis added.)


	
	He gave further evidence on this issue in cross-examination:
	


“Q.   In relation to your friend, Mr Nean, you told his Honour that he had anal intercourse with the girl?

A.   Sorry, I meant – I mean oral.

Q.   Oral?

A.   Yeah.

Q.   You’re aware of him rubbing his penis around the girl’s face?

A.   Not really.

Q.   Mm?

A.   Not really, no.

Q.   What do you mean by ‘oral intercourse’?

A.   She gave him – he put his penis in her mouth.

Q.   All right, so he had his penis up and near her face?

A.   Yeah.

Q.   And he put it in her mouth?

A.   He didn’t force it into her mouth.

Q.   He also put his finger into her, didn’t he?

A.   No, he didn’t.

Q.   You signed the facts agreeing to that, didn’t you?

A.   The facts state he put his finger up her, yeah. No, I didn’t. I might have signed it but I didn’t read it.

Q.   All right. I want you to tell his Honour – I’m going to ask you – you’re in the park with this young lady?

A.   Yes.

Q.   She’s on the ground?

A.   Yes.

Q.   You’ve had sexual intercourse with her?

A.   Yes.

Q.   At what stage during – did Mr Nean arrive?

A.   Mr Nean was with us the whole time.

Q.   Where was Mr Nean when the young lady was put on the ground?

A.   Mr Nean was sitting in the garden bed.

Q.   Where was Mr Nean when you were – when your penis was in the young lady’s vagina?

A.   He was sitting right next to her face.

Q.   All right, I want you to tell his Honour from the time the young lady was put on the ground until the time you got up and left, what did Mr Nean do?

A.   Mr Nean was still there having oral.

Q.   Sorry?

A.   Mr Nean was still having oral when I--

Q.   No, that’s a blunt description of what happened. What I’m asking you to tell his Honour in detail what it is you’re going to tell a jury that you saw Mr Nean do to her?

A.   I would tell the jury, I will tell anyone, jury, the magistrate, that he did have oral sex with her while I was there.

Q.   All right, what I’m asking you to do is what did he do? Tell the judge what he did when you say he had oral sex?

A.   That he struck his penis in her mouth.

Q.   Was he kneeling next to her or standing or how was he doing – what position was he in?

A.   He was kneeling.

Q.   And was he in that position before or after you commenced to have intercourse with her?

A.   During, as I was there and then he kneeled down.

Q.   And while you were having intercourse with this girl without her consent you saw him put his penis in her mouth?

A.   After. After I finished having sex with her.

Q.   After you’d finished?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And did you do or say anything when he did that?

A.   No, I’ve asked her, ‘cause he kept asking me was I – was he allowed to do it and I kept asking her and she didn’t say nothing, so I – he kept asking me and I asked her and she didn’t say nothing and when I jumped up he knelt down.”

(Emphasis added.)

(It is clear enough, I think, that his reference to anal intercourse was a mistake and he meant to say oral intercourse.)


	
	In his remarks on sentence the sentencing judge referred to the utilitarian discount to which the respondent was entitled because of his plea of guilty, noting that it had been a late plea. It was entered on the day the matter was fixed for trial. His Honour continued:
	


“Whilst I am talking about discounts, I should at this stage, mention this circumstance. The offender knows who the other man was. He knows who the man was who put his penis into the complainant’s mouth. He has not yet been arrested. There is a warrant out for his arrest but that has not been executed. The offender gave evidence in court before me, that should this offender be arrested, he is willing to give evidence against him. The offender is also therefore entitled, to a reduction on his sentence to reflect his willingness to assist the authorities. Combining both the discounts for pleading discounts (sic) and the discounts for assistance, meaning that I will impose upon the offender a sentence which is approximately 20 per cent less than it would otherwise have been.”


	
	The respondent had not made a statement to police setting out the evidence he could give against Mr Nean. Nor had he signed a written undertaking to give evidence.
	
	
	Mr Nean was subsequently arrested, and at his committal proceedings the respondent was called in the prosecution case. He had indicated before he entered the court that he was not prepared to give evidence at all. After he had been sworn he said that he was not going to give evidence and wished “to remain silent.” Insofar as he did answer questions, he claimed not to recall the incident at the park. Taken to his evidence in his sentence proceedings, he said at different stages that he did not recall it or that he told lies. He said that he did not recall saying that he was prepared to give evidence against Mr Nean.
	
	
	He denied that he had been threatened or been told in custody that he would be advised to keep his mouth shut. He said that he had not been told at any stage that if he did not honour his promise to give evidence against Mr Nean he could be re-sentenced. This led to the following exchange:
	


“Q.   So you’re prepared to wear everything, are you, as it were, take the rap for everything that happened?

A.   I’m doing it.

Q.   And face a charge of perjury. Do you know what perjury is?

A.   No.

Q.   Lying in court.

A.   Everyone lies in court. I’m not the first one to do it.”


	
	The only evidence of Mr Nean’s involvement was that anticipated from the respondent. As it was not forthcoming, Mr Nean was discharged.
	


The appeal


	
	In this court the Crown prosecutor submitted that the respondent had given an undertaking to assist law enforcement authorities, within the meaning of s 5DA(1), that he had clearly failed to honour it when he was called at the committal proceedings and that, accordingly, the sentencing process had miscarried. The rationale of s 5DA was explained, by reference to authority, by James J in R v Douar [2007] NSWCCA 123 at [29]:
	


“The principles to be applied on an appeal under s 5DA of the Criminal Appeal Act have been stated in a number of cases including R v O’Brien (NSWCCA unreported 10 June 1993), R v El-Sayed (2003) 57 NSWLR 659, R v Waqa (2004) 149 A Crim R 143, R v KS [2005] NSWCCA 87, R v Chaaban [2006] NSWCCA 352. These principles include:-

‘The purpose of section 5DA is not punitive. The purpose is to enable this Court in an appropriate case, and to an appropriate extent, to intervene to adjust or correct a sentence where the sentencing process can be seen, with the benefit of hindsight, to have miscarried by reason of the circumstances set out in the section.’ (O’Brien per Gleeson CJ at [2])

‘If the assistance and in particular the evidence, is not forthcoming, the discount has been obtained on an expectation which has not been fulfilled and the basis for the reduced sentence is removed. It is in these circumstances that s5DA allows the sentence to be varied to that which would have been imposed, subject always to the Court’s discretion not to intervene where circumstances justify such a course …’ (Waqa at 147 [24] per Dunford J).

‘… s5DA only authorises this Court to review the sentence where there has been breach of an undertaking to provide future assistance. In other words, where a discount has been allowed for the provision of past assistance and an undertaking to provide future assistance, and there is subsequently a breach of the undertaking to provide future assistance, this Court can adjust the sentence on account of the breach of that undertaking, but cannot interfere with that part of the reduction that has been allowed on account of the past assistance.’ (Waqa at 147-148 [26] per Dunford J)

‘In the event that the contemplated assistance is not given, s5DA provides a mechanism that allows the discount to be excised. It does not admit of reviewing the sentence generally …’ (Chaaban at [52] per Bell J).

‘The ability of the Crown to invoke this section is a very important part of the criminal justice system. Persons who give undertakings and who receive the benefit of those undertakings by way of a discounted sentence can, subject to exceptional circumstances, expect to have their sentences increased if they renege on their undertaking to give evidence. The departure from an undertaking of that kind is not to be regarded lightly and it will normally justify appellate intervention.’ (KS at [19] per Wood CJ at CL).”


	
	Provision for reduction of sentence where an offender has provided assistance to the authorities, or has undertaken to do so, is to be found in s 23 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. Relevantly for present purposes, that section provides:
	


“Power to reduce penalties for assistance provided to law enforcement authorities

(1)   A court may impose a lesser penalty than it would otherwise impose on an offender, having regard to the degree to which the offender has assisted, or undertaken to assist, law enforcement authorities in the prevention, detection or investigation of, or in proceedings relating to, the offence concerned or any other offence.

(2)   In deciding whether to impose a lesser penalty for an offence and the nature and extent of the penalty it imposes, the court must consider the following matters:

                                                                                                  …

(b)   the significance and usefulness of the offender’s assistance to the authority or authorities concerned, taking into consideration any evaluation by the authority or authorities of the assistance rendered or undertaken to be rendered,

(c)   the truthfulness, completeness and reliability of any information or evidence provided by the offender,

(d)   the nature and extent of the offender’s assistance or promised assistance,

(e)   the timeliness of the assistance or undertaking to assist,

(f)   any benefits that the offender has gained or may gain by reason of the assistance or undertaking to assist,

(g)   whether the offender will suffer harsher custodial conditions as a consequence of the assistance or undertaking to assist,

(h)   any injury suffered by the offender or the offender’s family, or any danger or risk of injury to the offender or the offender’s family, resulting from the assistance or undertaking to assist,

(i)   whether the assistance or promised assistance concerns the offence for which the offender is being sentenced or an unrelated offence,

                                                                                              …

(4)   A court that imposes a lesser penalty under this section on an offender because the offender has assisted, or undertaken to assist, law enforcement authorities must:

(a)   indicate to the offender, and make a record of the fact, that the lesser penalty is being imposed for either or both of those reasons, and

(b)   state the penalty that it would otherwise have imposed, and

(c)   where the lesser penalty is being imposed for both reasons-state the amount by which the penalty has been reduced for each reason.

                                                                                              …

(6)   The failure of a court to comply with the requirements of subsection (4) with respect to any sentence does not invalidate the sentence.”


	
	At issue in this appeal is the content of any undertaking said to have been given by the respondent, whether the sentencing judge in fact reduced the sentence he imposed because of an undertaking to assist in proceedings against Mr Nean and, if so, the extent of that reduction. A combined discount of “approximately 20%” for the respondent’s plea of guilty and his “willingness to assist the authorities” would not comply with s 23(4), because the proportion of that discount referable to the assistance was not specified.
	
	
	The failure to comply with subs (4) did not invalidate the sentence: subs (6), but it put the Crown prosecutor in this court to an educated guess about the reduction of sentence the respondent’s assistance had earned him. He noted that the late plea of guilty would be likely to have earned a discount of the order of 10%, and he argued that it “would have been apparent to the parties” that his Honour was allowing 10% for the plea and a further 10% for the promised assistance. It should be noted that at the sentence proceedings counsel for the respondent had submitted that a 10% discount for the plea was appropriate.
	
	
	Insofar as subs (4) distinguishes between past and future assistance, the Crown prosecutor submitted that the whole of the 10% discount was referable to future assistance. While the respondent had named Mr Nean during the police interview as the person who had been with him on the occasion in question, he did not inculpate him until his evidence in the sentence proceedings. In reality, the Crown prosecutor argued, there had been no past assistance.
	
	
	The primary submission of counsel for the respondent, Ms Cox, was that the respondent had not given an undertaking to assist law enforcement authorities capable of invoking this court’s jurisdiction under s 5DA. She relied on R v Stavropoulos [2007] NSWCCA 333, also a Crown appeal under s 5DA. There is no need to recite in any detail the course of events in that case. The respondent had pleaded guilty to an offence of aggravated kidnapping and had made a statement to police implicating two co-offenders. The sentencing judge had reduced his sentence in anticipation that he would give evidence against those co-offenders. The Crown’s complaint on appeal was that he departed significantly from his statement to the police when he gave evidence at the co-offenders’ trial. However, the appeal turned not upon whether he had failed to fulfil an undertaking to give evidence but, rather, whether he had given such an undertaking in the first place.
	
	
	The leading judgment was given by Hall J, with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Price J agreed. His Honour noted at [36] that the sentencing judge had allowed a “rolled-up” discount for the respondent’s plea of guilty and his assistance. That was a practice consistent with authority at the time, but it should be understood that the case was decided before subs (4) was inserted into s 23 by a 2010 amendment. There was no letter of assistance from police before the court. The Crown had not suggested that the respondent had given a written undertaking to provide future assistance, nor was there any record of an obligation on his part to give evidence against the co-offenders: [35]. Nevertheless, in his remarks on sentence the sentencing judge had observed that the respondent’s statement to police was the “evidence that he is prepared to give in court” and that it was “likely” that he would be called as a Crown witness: [36], [37].
	
	
	Hall J noted at [38] that “the sentencing judge spoke in terms of a willingness or preparedness by the respondent to give evidence, rather than there being any reference to an undertaking or an obligation by him to do so.” He observed at [42] that it was common ground that the respondent’s statement to police constituted “assistance” within the meaning of s 23, and that the issue was “whether or not the respondent also undertook to further assist the Crown by having given an undertaking to assist in proceedings against his co-offenders.” The respondent had not given evidence in the sentence proceedings. In submissions to the sentencing judge his counsel said that it was “proposed” that his client would give evidence, while acknowledging that his statement was inconsistent with the statement of the victim in relation to a significant matter and that the Crown might see “a potential difficulty” in calling him as a witness. The Crown prosecutor in the sentence proceedings said that it would “end up being a matter for the trial Crown as to whether this witness will be called”, adding that it might be seen that his statement “may not have been as full and frank as what we had wished for”: [45], [46].
	
	
	Hall J said at [56]:
	


“It is plainly desirable that any undertaking or promise for future assistance referred to in s.23 of the Act is framed with a degree of specificity. This is so, firstly, so that the nature and extent of any obligation arising under an undertaking may be identified and, secondly, to provide a proper basis for proceedings under s.5DA of the Criminal Appeal Act in which a question of breach of undertaking arises.”


	
	His Honour noted at [59] that there was no evidence that the respondent’s statement was an induced statement, and that it began with the conventional opening paragraph:
	


“1. This statement made by me accurately sets out the evidence which I would be prepared, if necessary, to give in court as a witness. The statement is true to the best of my knowledge and belief and I make it knowing that, if it is tendered in evidence, I will be liable to prosecution if I have wilfully stated in it anything that I know to be false or do not believe to be true.”


	
	At [60] his Honour summarised the relevant features of the case as follows:
	


“Accordingly, the position in the present matter is that:-

(a)   There is no indication in the respondent’s statement … of an undertaking by him that he would give evidence or that, if he were called to give evidence, it would be in the terms of his written statement.

(b)   There is no evidence given by any witness on behalf of the Crown that the respondent, in fact, gave an undertaking as now claimed.

(c)   There is no indication in the remarks on sentence either that an undertaking had been given within the meaning of s.23 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act or that in determining the sentence, the sentencing judge determined the respondent’s sentence upon the basis that some undertaking had been given by him within the terms of s.23.

(d)   There was some uncertainty as to whether or not the Crown would call the respondent to give evidence at the hearing of proceedings against his co-offenders. However, the prospect that he would be called was spoken of in terms of it being ‘likely’.

(e)   The evidence at its highest establishes that the respondent was prepared to give evidence, that there was an expectation of him being called to give evidence and of his stated willingness or preparedness to give evidence.”


	
	His Honour expressed his conclusion at [61], as follows:
	


“In oral submissions, the Crown contended that the Court could infer that an undertaking had been given as the discount given on sentence was, it submitted, something which ‘bespeaks’ the giving of an undertaking. There are two points in relation to that submission. Firstly, a reading of the transcript of the sentencing hearing conveys that there was an expectation that the respondent would more than likely be called to give evidence at his co-offender’s trial. An expectation, however, is not an undertaking within the meaning of s.23 of the Act. Secondly, whilst it is clear that the respondent had provided a measure of assistance in the form of his statement to police and prospectively indicated his preparedness to give evidence, the issue as to whether he was obligated to give evidence was not raised before the sentencing judge.”

Accordingly, his Honour held that the appeal failed “upon the basis that the evidence does not establish that the respondent bound himself, by way of a promise or undertaking, an essential matter for an application under s 5DA”: [62].


	
	While acknowledging that the present case is not on all fours with Stavropoulos, Ms Cox argued there are relevant similarities and that the approach of Hall J should be adopted here. She noted that the matters in s 23(2), relating to the significance, value and implications of assistance of authorities, were not addressed. In particular, his Honour did not consider the reliability of the evidence the respondent said he was prepared to give against Mr Nean: subs (2)(c). Ms Cox observed that in the recorded interview he had not inculpated Mr Nean at all, and in his evidence he said that Mr Nean had oral intercourse with the complainant but denied that he had inserted his finger into her vagina, even though he had signed a statement of facts asserting both those things. Ms Cox argued that at the time of the sentence there was a real question whether, given these inconsistencies, the Crown would have called him as a witness in any proceedings against Mr Nean.
	
	
	Ms Cox also relied upon the course of addresses in the sentence proceedings. As to assistance, counsel for the respondent had said no more than that his Honour had “also heard his evidence in relation to the assistance that he would be willing to give the police in relation to the co-offender.” More importantly, all that was said about it by the Crown prosecutor was as follows:
	


“[Crown Prosecutor]: … There’s the issue that arises as to any discount for assistance or future assistance. Your Honour’s heard the nature of what he apparently intends to say.

HIS HONOUR: He’s prepared to give evidence incriminating his cousin.

[Crown Prosecutor]: He’s prepared to give evidence, your Honour but it’s not exactly, with respect, there’s a certain amount of minimising of what Mr Nean is supposed to have done involved in it, so I’ll allow your Honour just to take that into account in assessing it.

HIS HONOUR: Thank you.”


	
	Ms Cox submitted that what the respondent said in evidence fell short of an undertaking to assist the authorities within the meaning of s 23 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and s 5DA of the Criminal Appeal Act. The effect of her argument was that his Honour’s combined discount of sentence was intended merely to recognise the respondent’s expressed willingness to give evidence against Mr Nean as a subjective matter in his favour. If his Honour had intended to allow a discount for future assistance capable of being adjusted by this court if it were not provided, she argued, he would unquestionably have spelled out the matters required by s 23(4). In fact, neither in his Honour’s remarks nor in the addresses of counsel was there any reference at all to s 23.
	
	
	Ms Cox submitted that, if the court found that there was an undertaking by the respondent to give evidence and the court were minded to intervene, there should be seen to have been a component of past assistance. She argued that the respondent’s revelation in the police interview of the identity of Mr Nean was itself of value, leading to the issue of a warrant for his arrest. Accordingly, she submitted, if we were satisfied that 10% of the discount should be attributed to assistance, 5% of that should be referable to past assistance. Otherwise, Ms Cox argued that the appeal should be dismissed on discretionary grounds, to which I shall turn later.
	
	
	The Crown prosecutor in this court emphasised that, unlike Stavropoulos, in the present case the respondent gave evidence in the sentence proceedings in the course of which he volunteered to give evidence against Mr Nean. The Crown Prosecutor relied upon the evidence I have quoted above, particularly the emphasised passages. Read as a whole, he submitted, the evidence amounts to an undertaking by the respondent to give evidence. Equally, he argued, the respondent must have understood that a proportion of the discount of sentence he received was referable to that undertaking and was allowed in the expectation that he would honour it. Moreover, given that his counsel had sought a discount of 10% in recognition of the plea of guilty, he would have understood the discount for assistance to have been of the same order.
	
	
	The Crown prosecutor noted authority that, for the purpose of s 5DA, an undertaking need not necessarily be in writing. In R v O’Brien (CCA, unreported, 10 June 1993), Gleeson CJ (with whom Sheller JA and Newman J agreed) said (at p 2):
	


“It was submitted on behalf of the respondent that the undertaking referred to in s 5DA must be in writing. I would reject that submission. There is nothing in the legislation which supports it. On the other hand, I acknowledge that practical difficulties could arise in individual cases unless there is clarity as to the undertaking in question and, in the ordinary course, it would help to achieve such clarity if the relevant undertaking were obtained in writing.”


	
	The Crown prosecutor acknowledged that there were issues of credibility affecting the evidence the respondent might have given in the proceedings against Mr Nean. However, he argued that at the very least the evidence would have pointed to Mr Nean as the second man involved in the incident as the complainant had described it. He also acknowledged that his Honour had not said anything in his remarks on sentence about his evaluation of the potential evidence and, more importantly, had not complied with s 23(4). He argued, however, that allowance should be made for the fact that his Honour’s remarks were delivered ex tempore in proceedings in a regional court.
	
	
	This is an unusual case. In evidence in the sentence proceedings the respondent made what appears to have been an unsolicited offer to give evidence against Mr Nean. In that respect this case is distinguishable from Stavropoulos. The respondent also made it clear enough what the effect of his evidence would be. I would infer that his Honour’s combined discount of sentence took that offer of assistance into account in the expectation that the respondent would give the evidence.
	
	
	I accept the Crown prosecutor’s submission that the discount was directed only to future assistance. So much is apparent from his Honour’s reference, in the passage from his remarks on sentence quoted at [8] above, to his “willingness to assist the authorities.” While it is true that the respondent’s revelation of the name of his companion in the police interview enabled that person to be identified, that was of no value unless he was prepared to give evidence against him. That was the view taken by this court in a case involving a similar situation: R v Carriage [2009] NSWCCA 147, although it should be noted that senior counsel for the respondent in that case put no submission to the contrary.
	
	
	The difficulty that his Honour did not specify the proportion of the combined discount referable to assistance was addressed in supplementary submissions by counsel for the parties. It is open to this court to make its own assessment of the appropriate discount. That was the course taken in R v GD [2013] NSWCCA 212, where a rolled-up discount for a plea of guilty and assistance had been allowed. It appeared to the court that the sentencing judge had reduced the sentence because of past and future assistance. The court’s approach was expressed by Button J, with whom Leeming JA and RA Hume J agreed, at [39]:
	


“The result is that this Court must attempt to construe the various components of the global discount provided by his Honour in order to determine this appeal. To the extent that that exercise may be impossible to achieve with complete accuracy, I consider that this Court should make its own assessment.”

In the present case I think it likely that his Honour intended a discount of 10% which, in any event, would have been appropriate.


	
	In the circumstances, then, I am persuaded that the respondent did give an undertaking, embraced by s 5DA(1), to give evidence against Mr Nean and that undertaking earned him a discount of the order of 10%. It is, of course, not in dispute that he failed to fulfil it. I should add that the fact that neither his Honour nor counsel expressly referred to s 23 is significant only to the extent that it may indicate that its requirements were overlooked. The exchange between the Crown prosecutor and his Honour set out at [26] above suggests that the prosecutor was inviting his Honour to assess the reliability of the respondent’s anticipated evidence, consistently with s 23(2)(c), although his Honour’s remarks do not disclose that he did so.
	
	
	The question remains whether this court, in its discretion, should intervene and adjust the sentence accordingly. With the wisdom of hindsight, it might have been preferable to adjourn the proceedings in the light of the respondent’s evidence to see whether he was prepared to make a statement to the police and to sign an undertaking to give evidence against Mr Nean. However, this court must deal with events as they occurred in the District Court. There is no doubt that, where the prerequisites for a successful appeal in s 5DA(1) are established, the court retains a discretion as to whether it should intervene: R v KS [2005] NSWCCA 87 at [21]. Ms Cox relied on two matters to support a submission that this court should stay its hand: the relevantly small discount involved and the delay in bringing the appeal.
	
	
	As to the size of the discount, Mrs Cox relied upon the proposition that only 5% was referable to future assistance but maintained her argument even if it were 10%. To deprive the respondent of the benefit of the 10% discount would mean an increase in the head sentence of about 10 months (and, proportionally, of about 6 months in relation to the non-parole period). That effect would not be insignificant and I do not think that, standing alone, it should prevent this court from adjusting the sentence.
	
	
	However, the delay in bringing the appeal is significant and, in my view, the combination of the two matters mitigates against allowing the appeal. The respondent was sentenced on 31 January 2013. He was called to give evidence in the committal proceedings against Mr Nean, when he failed to fulfil his undertaking, on 22 April 2014. It was nearly 9 months later, on 9 January 2015, when the appeal was lodged. The Crown prosecutor in this court frankly acknowledged that there was no explanation for that delay other that it being “symptomatic of a regional office.”
	
	
	For these reasons I am of the view that the appeal should be dismissed. However, to those two discretionary matters I would add another: the failure of the Crown prosecutor and counsel for the respondent in the District Court to draw his Honour’s attention to the requirements of s 23(4). It is important that the subsection be complied with. This court should not have to undertake the task which it did in GD. The purpose of the subsection is to ensure that the offender is left in no doubt about the extent to which his or her sentence has been reduced by assistance to the authorities, both past and future, and that, in the event of a s 5DA appeal, this court is in the same position. It is incumbent not only on the sentencing judge, but also upon the legal representatives of the parties, to ensure that these matters are addressed.
	
	
	I would dismiss the appeal.
	
	
	BEECH-JONES J: I agree with Hidden J.

2703239,Browning v R [2015] NSWCCA 147,"_________________________________________________________

Judgment


	
	GLEESON JA: I agree with the orders proposed by Garling J for the reasons given by his Honour. I also agree with the additional observations of Johnson J
	
	
	JOHNSON J: I have had the advantage of reading the draft judgment of Garling J. I agree with his Honour’s reasons and proposed orders, but wish to make some further observations.
	
	
	Firstly, I agree with Garling J’s statement (at [99]) that the mid-range finding by his Honour was, if anything, unduly favourable to the applicant. This was a sustained attempt by the applicant to set alight to his wife, whom he had doused with petrol. The impediment to his success was the repeated intervention of some courageous young men, who acted to protect Toni Browning in the dire circumstances which presented themselves. As this case demonstrates, an offence under s.47 Crimes Act 1900 may serve to instil great fear in the mind of the victim, who has been (in this case) covered with petrol and left to contemplate what is to happen next. The terror experienced by Toni Browning in this case is entirely understandable.
	
	
	Secondly, this offence was committed whilst the applicant was subject to a good behaviour bond imposed in the District Court on 28 March 2013, about one week prior to the commission of the offence. Not only was the applicant subject to conditional liberty at the time of the offence, but the orders binding him had been put in place to protect Toni Browning against a background of violence directed to her by the applicant.
	
	
	An apprehended domestic violence order had been put in place in September 2012 to protect Toni Browning from the applicant. That order was made under the legislative scheme described by Spigelman CJ (Mason P and Beazley JA agreeing) in John Fairfax Publications Pty Limited v Ryde Local Court [2005] NSWCA 101; 62 NSWLR 512 at 519 [20]:
	


“The legislative scheme is directed to the protection of the community in a direct and immediate sense, rather than through mechanisms such as deterrence. Individuals can obtain protection against actual or threatened acts of personal violence, stalking intimidation and harassment. Apprehended Violence Orders constitute the primary means in this State of asserting the fundamental right to freedom from fear. The objects served by such orders are quite distinct from those that are served by civil adversarial proceedings or proceedings in which an arm of the State seeks to enforce the criminal law.”


	
	The applicant breached the apprehended domestic violence order, leading to the imposition of non-custodial sentences in the Local Court and then (on appeal) in the District Court on 28 March 2013.
	
	
	In committing the s.47 offence on 5 April 2013 (and the associated Form 1 offences), the applicant was to be classified as a repeat domestic violence offender. In passing sentence for the present offence, it was appropriate to have in mind the statement of this Court in R v Hamid [2006] NSWCCA 302; 164 A Crim R 179 at 195-196 [86]:
	


“In sentencing a domestic violence offender, and in particular a repeat domestic violence offender, specific and general deterrence are important factors, together with the requirement of powerful denunciation by the community of such conduct and the need for protection of the community. Recognition of the harm done to the victim and the community as a result of crimes of domestic violence is important.”


	
	Where a court has made an apprehended domestic violence order to protect a person, and then further orders are made by way of conditional liberty for criminal offences arising from breaches of that order, the commission of another offence, in breach of that conditional liberty, will constitute significant aggravating circumstances: s.21A(2)(j) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. This is especially so where the offence against the protected person is of the very grave character of the s.47 offence in this case, with the offence being committed so soon after the applicant had been given the benefit of conditional liberty by order of the District Court.
	
	
	Thirdly, four further offences were to be taken into account on a Form 1 in passing sentence for the s.47 offence. These four offences included two offences, committed on 10 February 2013, of intimidating Toni Browning with intent to cause fear or physical or mental harm and contravention of a condition of an apprehended domestic violence order. In addition, two offences committed on 5 April 2013 (in the context of the s.47 offence) were to be taken into account, being intentionally damaging Toni Browning’s mobile phone and a further contravention of a condition of the apprehended domestic violence order. In taking these offences into account on the Form 1, the sentencing court was required to give greater weight to the need for personal deterrence and the community’s entitlement to exact retribution for serious offences: Attorney General’s Application Under Section 37 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (No. 1 of 2002) [2002] NSWCCA 518; 56 NSWLR 146 at 159 [42].
	
	
	The sentencing outcome in this case represented a restrained approach on the part of the sentencing Judge in all the circumstances of the case.
	
	
	GARLING J: Peter Browning, the applicant, seeks leave to appeal against a sentence imposed upon him on 2 May 2014 in the District Court.
	
	
	On 2 May 2014, the applicant pleaded guilty to a single offence contrary to s 47 of the Crimes Act 1900, namely, that:
	


“On 5 April 2013, at Daleys Point in the State of NSW [he] did throw an explosive substance, namely petrol, upon Toni Browning with intent to burn her.”


	
	The District Court (Ellis DCJ) imposed a sentence of 7½ years to commence on 8 April 2013, with a non-parole period of 4 years commencing on the same date.
	
	
	The maximum penalty for an offence contrary to s 47 of the Crimes Act is 25 years imprisonment.
	


Other Relevant Matters


	
	In addition to the offence to which the applicant pleaded guilty, he asked the Court, pursuant to s 33 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 to take into account four charges which were placed on a Form 1. Those charges included an offence of intimidating Mrs Browning with intent to cause her fear of physical or mental harm contrary to s 13(1) of the Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act 2007, two offences contrary to s 14(1) of the Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act of contravening a condition of an apprehended domestic violence order which was made for the protection of Mrs Browning, and a charge of intentionally damaging Mrs Browning’s mobile phone contrary to s 195(1)(a) of the Crimes Act.
	
	
	At the time of the sentencing proceedings, the Crown withdrew a backup charge which had been preferred against the applicant. However, the Court was asked to deal with two offences contrary to s 13(1) of the Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act which had been placed on a certificate pursuant to s 166 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986.
	
	
	In respect of those two offences, to which the applicant pleaded guilty, he was sentenced in each case imprisonment for 3 months to date from 8 April 2013 and to expire on 7 July 2013. These terms of imprisonment were wholly concurrent with each other, and with the sentence imposed in respect of the principal offence against s 47 of the Crimes Act.
	
	
	These two sentences have been served. There is no application before the Court in respect of these sentences. Other than as a matter of context, they are of no further relevance to the consideration of this application.
	


Agreed Facts


	
	The applicant and Mrs Toni Browning were married for over 30 years until they separated in August 2012.
	
	
	After separation, Mrs Browning moved in with her parents in the Daley’s Point area. The applicant remained living in the marital home in the Wamberal area.
	
	
	On 11 September 2012, an Apprehended Domestic Violence order (“the ADVO”) was made for a period of 12 months at the Lismore Local Court.
	
	
	Notwithstanding that ADVO, which restrained the applicant from threatening or intimidating or approaching or contacting Mrs Browning in any way, the applicant contravened it. On two occasions in late January 2013 and mid‑February 2013, the applicant breached the terms of the ADVO by approaching Mrs Browning, first when she was visiting the Ettalong Markets in the company of her elderly mother, and secondly, when she was at a tavern at Empire Bay with members of her family. On each of those occasions the applicant was reminded firmly that he was not entitled to approach Mrs Browning or communicate with her. As he was leaving on each occasion, the applicant threatened Mrs Browning.
	
	
	On 5 April 2013, Mrs Browning was driving home with her elderly mother. As she travelled through a roundabout, it became apparent that the applicant was driving his motor vehicle in the same roundabout, I infer, having followed her. She drove to her home, and pulled in along the driveway. As she pulled up outside her home, the applicant stopped his vehicle in the driveway directly behind her vehicle. She attempted to lock the motor vehicle but was unsuccessful. She took out her mobile phone in order to attempt to ring the police. At that point in time, the applicant approached the driver’s side of the car where Mrs Browning was sitting. He opened the door, grabbed her mobile telephone from her and threw it to the ground, smashing it. The applicant punched Mrs Browning to the right side of her head and dragged her from the car. The applicant was heard shouting at Mrs Browning and, also, her mother.
	
	
	At about that point in time, Mrs Browning heard the accused say “I’ve 30 litres of petrol and I am gunna burn …”. Mrs Browning could not make out the balance of what the applicant said.
	
	
	Three teenage boys, who were in the next door property, alerted by Mrs Browning’s screams, came to her assistance. They observed the applicant standing over Mrs Browning, holding her by her shirt. When confronted by them, and having been told to stop, the applicant replied: “Leave it, it’s my wife”.
	
	
	The applicant then let go of Mrs Browning and walked to the back of his motor vehicle where he took out a black jerry can full of petrol. Mrs Browning got up and ran towards the set of stairs on the side of her house. The applicant chased her, and caught her. He took the cap off the jerry can and poured the contents of the can over her head.
	
	
	The applicant then took out a box of matches and attempted to light one of the matches. The three teenage boys jumped over the fence separating them from the applicant, and ran to the aid of Mrs Browning. One of the boys grabbed the applicant and pulled him away from Mrs Browning and onto the ground, causing him to drop the matches. That teenager then threw the matches into a neighbour’s yard.
	
	
	Mrs Browning was screaming because the petrol was burning her face. One of the other teenagers obtained a hose and helped to wash the petrol off Mrs Browning. The third teenager called the police.
	
	
	Apparently undaunted, the applicant walked back to his vehicle and got another jerry can of petrol out of it. He poured its contents onto the driveway so that the petrol ran down to where Mrs Browning was standing. The petrol ran under the motorcar which had been driven by Mrs Browning to her house, and in which her elderly mother was still sitting.
	
	
	The applicant, who by then was sitting in the front driver’s seat of his motor car with the door open, attempted to light small pieces of paper with a cigarette lighter and throw them onto the petrol which had been poured on the ground, so as to ignite it. The burning paper went out before the petrol ignited.
	
	
	Upon seeing what the applicant was doing, one of the teenagers ran up and pushed the driver’s door closed to stop him throwing the lit paper out of the car and onto the spilled petrol.
	
	
	The applicant started his motor car and left the scene. He was arrested by the police a short time later.
	
	
	During an interview with police, the applicant told police that he was aware of the ADVO in place against him for the protection of his wife. He was asked about the allegations that he had assaulted Mrs Browning and poured petrol over her head. He responded “I don’t remember … I blanked out”.
	
	
	As a result of the whole of the incident, Mrs Browning suffered scratches and bruising to the right side of her face and head, and minor petrol burns to various parts of her body.
	
	
	These facts, to which I have just referred, were drawn from a Statement of Facts which was tendered by the Crown to the sentencing Judge, and which was not objected to.
	
	
	The applicant was called to give evidence during the sentencing proceedings. He was asked about the events of 5 April 2013. He told the Court that he could remember seeing his wife’s car stopped in the driveway, and he pulled in behind it in order to speak to her. He said that after that point in time he could remember nothing as to what happened. He agreed that, as witnesses had observed him pouring petrol over his wife, that must have been what occurred.
	
	
	In cross-examination the applicant, when taken to the events of 5 April 2013, agreed that he poured petrol on his wife, but denied that he lit or attempted to light the petrol. His attention was drawn to the inconsistency between that evidence and the Agreed Statement of Facts. He responded that he did not remember what happened. Ultimately, in response to a question from the sentencing Judge, the applicant agreed that he did take out matches, attempt to light the petrol, but was unable so to do.
	


Proceedings on Sentence


	
	The Crown tendered a Victim Impact Statement from Mrs Browning. In that statement she recorded that she was still traumatised by the events of the physical attack upon her. She told the Court that she could still smell petrol covering her body. She felt guilty that her elderly mother was trapped in a car which was covered in, and surrounded by, petrol. She said that she still feared the horrific consequences had her elderly mother become trapped in a burning vehicle.
	
	
	She reported that she continued to feel terrified even though the applicant was in jail, and that she was fearful for herself and for her family and friends once the applicant was released from jail.
	
	
	The Crown also tendered a criminal history record for the applicant. That form recorded that the applicant, who was born in October 1955, and accordingly was 57 at the time of the offences, had a criminal history which, after achieving his adulthood, involved offences dealing with driving motor vehicles in 1974 and 1990, and a minor offence of unlawful carnal knowledge in 1978. But for those relatively minor offences, until 2012, the applicant had no criminal history as an adult - certainly, no history which was relevant to these offences
	
	
	On 4 February 2013, the applicant was dealt with in the Gosford Local Court for two offences of contravening a restriction in an ADVO and for an offence of common assault. For each of those offences, the applicant was convicted and placed on a bond to be of good behaviour pursuant to s 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. An appeal was lodged. It was dealt with in the District Court at Gosford in March 2013. On that day, with respect to each offence, the convictions were set aside and the Court, without proceeding to a conviction, imposed with respect to each offence, a bond pursuant to s 10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act for a period of 18 months.
	
	
	The bonds were imposed in the Gosford District Court in March 2013 by Ellis DCJ, before whom the sentencing proceedings came.
	
	
	The Crown also put before the Court a Pre-Sentence Report, which had been obtained from Community Corrections for the purpose of the sentence.
	
	
	The applicant’s attitude to his offending was discussed during the course of the interview for the pre-sentence report. It was concluded that the applicant had minimised his offending significantly, and found it difficult to empathise with the victim, Mrs Browning. Ultimately, he conceded to the interviewer that he was ashamed of his behaviour.
	
	
	It was concluded that he had a medium risk of re-offending. He was assessed as suitable for a range of education programs, including the Domestic Abuse Program.
	
	
	Ultimately, Community Corrections concluded:
	


“It appears that Mr Browning’s wife left the marriage in 2012, and the offender’s mental health deteriorated over a number of months. Mr Browning’s attitude to his offending behaviour is concerning as he continues to blame the victim and her family for his actions. His regret appears to be focussed around his own circumstances.”


	
	In late November 2012, the applicant had been seen by a registered psychologist at the Reid Clinic. He had been referred there by his general practitioner, who was concerned with his levels of distress, and his declining ability to attend to, and concentrate on, his business, consequent upon the separation from his wife.
	
	
	According to the tests administered, the applicant was found to have mild depression and significant anxiety and stress. He was medicated for the depression, and also for hypertension. He was ultimately diagnosed with an adjustment disorder, mixed anxiety and depressed mood.
	
	
	On the day following the incident, and after his arrest, the applicant was admitted to the mental health unit at Gosford Hospital and detained there under the Mental Health Act 2007. By the conclusion of his period of detention, there was no evidence of any major mental illness or disorder. He apparently expressed remorse over the alleged incidents prior to his admission, and the discharge summary notes that his claimed poor recollection of the incident did not appear to have any organic basis.
	
	
	He was discharged from the facility back into police custody.
	
	
	A forensic psychiatric report dated 30 May 2013, was also put before the sentencing Judge. It had been obtained previously for consideration when he was being sentenced for his earlier offences.
	
	
	The report identified some physical problems associated with high cholesterol, angina and hypertension. Insofar as a psychiatric diagnosis was concerned, it concluded that the applicant had a chronic adjustment disorder with depressed mood, and associated major depressive disorder.
	
	
	As well, the sentencing Judge had a psychiatric report of Dr Richard Furst, consultant forensic psychiatrist, before him.
	
	
	The applicant gave a history to Dr Furst with respect to events after his separation. He said:
	


“Mr Browning described becoming severely depressed after the marital separation, having been low in mood even before his wife left him. He was unable to cope, felt very depressed, became withdrawn, gained weight, lost interest in things, lost his motivation and drive to work, had low energy levels, felt agitated, irritable and moody, noticed his concentration and memory were letting him down, and suffered from insomnia – sleeping only around two hours per night.”


	
	The applicant gave a history to Dr Furst, that he had felt hopeless and suicidal and had made, what seems to be, a desultory attempt to hang himself on 11 February 2013, as a consequence of which he was admitted to the Mandala Clinic, the mental health unit at Gosford Hospital for a period of about 2½ weeks, after which he returned home.
	
	
	The applicant maintained to Dr Furst that he had no recollection of the circumstance surrounding his offence, although he reconstructed that he probably wanted to speak to his wife to know why she had left him.
	
	
	Dr Furst then reviewed a series of relevant documents, including a psychiatric report of Professor David Greenberg dated 30 May 2013. Dr Furst agreed with the diagnosis by Professor Greenberg, that the applicant had a major depressive order prior to the offence. He differed from Professor Greenberg in that he would not have concluded that the applicant had a chronic adjustment disorder.
	
	
	Dr Furst certainly concluded that the applicant was properly required to have ongoing psychiatric care.
	
	
	With respect to the events in question, Dr Furst expressed these various comments:
	


“[The applicant] was probably suffering from severe depressions at the time of the offences in question before the Court, having lost weight, being unable to sleep, attempting suicide in February, and feeling hopeless, losing motivation and general decompensating to the point that he was unable to concentrate properly and became lost in familiar areas on two occasions. …

He reported a poor memory for the alleged offences before the Court on 5/4/13, but had intact recollection right up until the moments before the offence. Although his reported amnesia is a consideration, it is unlikely that he was acting in a state of dissociation or has the defence of automatism available, as his alleged actions were purposeful and he was able to make coherent statements of an angry nature to the victim and his mother …

…

It is likely that Mr Browning acted on impulse at the time of the offences in question in response to his severe depression, feelings of anger and inability to come to terms with his marital separation. He may well have struggled to control himself at the time.

…

Although his depression was precipitated by the shock of his marital separation, the severity of his depressive symptoms make a diagnosis of major disorder more appropriate than an adjustment disorder alone.

A major depressive disorder is an illness characterised by a pervasive low mood, low self-esteem and loss of interest or pleasure in normally enjoyable activities. It is a disabling condition that has an adverse impact on a person’s ability to work or study, their family life, sleeping and eating habits and general health. Diagnosis is based upon a combination of self-reported symptoms and mental state features. Depressed individuals may be preoccupied with, or ruminate over, thoughts and feelings of worthlessness, inappropriate guilt or regret, helplessness, hopelessness and self-hatred.

Other symptoms of depression include poor concentration and memory, withdrawal from social situations and activities, reduced sex drive and thoughts of death or suicide. Insomnia is common. It is common for individuals with depression to present with physical complaints including fatigue, headaches, or problems with digestion. The more severe depressive symptoms are typically referred to as melancholic, which are characterised by a more severe level of depressed mood, anhedonia (loss of pleasure and profound sadness) and psychomotor agitation.”


	
	Dr Furst concluded that Mr Browning was receiving appropriate treatment for his psychiatric condition and would probably make a reasonable recovery over coming months if he continued with his general treatment program.
	
	
	As I noted earlier, the applicant was called to give evidence during the sentencing proceedings. In his evidence in chief, he told the Court that he felt very ashamed of himself for the behaviour in which he engaged on 5 April 2013. He asserted that he would not offend again, and that if placed in the position in which he was in the past, namely, in or near the presence of the victim, Mrs Browning, he would walk away from such a circumstance because he had “… been through enough punishment already”.
	
	
	A fair reading of the applicant’s evidence would suggest that at least until the end of the cross-examination, when he was asked a number of questions by the sentencing Judge, he was reluctant to accept that he had undertaken all of the conduct reported by the independent witnesses, and contained in the Agreed Statement of Facts, and he was reluctant to accept that his wife was not the cause of the dispute, and shared some blame. It would seem that, ultimately, he came to an acceptance of those facts.
	
	
	At the conclusion of the applicant’s evidence, the applicant’s solicitor made oral addresses to the Court, as did the Crown.
	
	
	At the conclusion of addresses, his Honour proceeded to impose the sentence and deliver his Remarks on Sentence.
	


Remarks on Sentence


	
	His Honour commenced by identifying the offence, and noting the maximum penalty applicable. In particular, his Honour noted that the offence did not require the infliction of bodily injury.
	
	
	His Honour then turned his attention to the Agreed Statement of Facts, and set out a comprehensive version of those facts. No criticism is directed to his Honour’s summary.
	
	
	His Honour noted that the applicant pleaded guilty in the Local Court, and was entitled to a discount of 25%, and he also noted that the applicant had been in custody since 8 April 2013, and he indicated that he would backdate his sentence to then.
	
	
	It is convenient here to interrupt the summary of his Honour’s Remarks on Sentence to indicate that, in this Court, it is agreed between the Crown and the applicant’s counsel, that his Honour should have backdated the sentence so as to commence on 5 April 2013, which was the day on which the applicant was arrested and taken into custody. It is agreed that his period of time in the mental health unit at Gosford Hospital ought count as part of his time in custody.
	
	
	Regardless of the outcome of the substantive grounds argued on this appeal, it will be necessary for the Court to, at the least, resentence the applicant so that his sentence commences on 5 April 2013.
	
	
	His Honour noted the applicant’s previous offences and, in particular, the fact that he had appeared a little over a week prior to the offence in question in the District Court at Gosford before his Honour.
	
	
	His Honour noted the way in which he would deal with the breaches of the bonds. No complaint is made with respect to that.
	
	
	His Honour’s attention had been drawn to the decision of R v Dinh [2010] NSWCCA 74; (2010) 199 A Crim R 573. His Honour considered that decision.
	
	
	His Honour noted that the principle set out in Dinh required him to regard the range of acts set out in s 47 of the Crimes Act as not being hierarchical, but rather that it was a matter for him to determine what the factual situation was in this case, and ultimately determine where it falls on the continuum of offending against the particular provision.
	
	
	His Honour then considered the question of the extent of the applicant’s intent with respect to formulating a view as to the seriousness of his conduct. His Honour noted that he accepted that the matter proceeds on the basis that the incident was not a pre-meditated one, it was nevertheless clear that the applicant had formed an intent that he was serious in his attempts to set alight to the victim, and that he made a number of attempts so to do. His Honour noted that that crime was only prevented by the intervention of the three teenagers who were “… courageous in coming to the aid of the victim”. This is undoubtedly true.
	
	
	His Honour concluded that the matter fell within the mid-range of offending, and that the only reason that it did not fall in a more serious range was because there was no premeditation. His Honour also accepted that, at the time of the offence, the applicant had been diagnosed as suffering from a major depressive illness.
	
	
	However, his Honour noted there was no direct causal connection between the offending and that illness as being relevant and took it into account when considering whether or not general deterrence played as significant a role as it otherwise might.
	
	
	His Honour concluded from hearing the evidence of the applicant that he had demonstrated insight into his offence and that he had now expressed some contrition, not because of what had happened to him but because he had realised, and accepted, the consequences of his offending on the victim.
	
	
	His Honour expressed the view that the sentencing exercise was a difficult one with “very little, if any, guidance in terms of specifics”. His Honour had regard to the principle set out in the decision of Dinh.
	
	
	His Honour concluded in this way:
	


“I decide this matter on the basis of my conclusion as to the objective criminality being in the mid-range but I note that it is against the background of an offence that is a very serious criminal offence which carries a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment, and that that penalty applies regardless of whether an individual suffers actual bodily harm or not. …”


	
	His Honour then indicated that he thought that the notional commencement point of the sentence was 10 years. He then discounted it by 25% for the early plea of guilty, leaving a remaining head sentence of 7½ years. His Honour found special circumstances and determined to fix a non-parole period of 4 years.
	
	
	His Honour dated the sentence to commence from 8 April 2013, which was when the applicant was formally taken into custody, having been released from the Mental Health Unit at the Gosford Hospital.
	
	
	Finally, his Honour noted that, in assessing the sentencing, he had taken into account all of the matters on the Form 1.
	


Application for Leave to Appeal


	
	The applicant seeks leave to appeal on the basis of six grounds. They are as follows:
	


“(1)   The Court’s finding that the s 47 Crimes Act 1900 offence was in the mid-range of seriousness failed to adequately account for the Court’s findings that the offence was not pre-meditated but spontaneous, that no significant harm was occasioned to the victim, and that the appellant’s attempts to carry out his intended actions were less determined than in other examples of this offence, and other matters which bore on the assessment of the seriousness of the offence.

(2)   The Court erred in finding that there was “no evidence of any direct causal connection” between the applicant’s offending and his major depressive illness.

(3)   The Court’s stated “starting point” of 10 years total term, and the ultimate reduced total term of 7½ years, reflected a reduction of 25% for the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty but failed to take into account the other factors in mitigation that were not taken into account by the Court in the finding of special circumstances.

(4)   The Court erred in inviting the Crown to give its opinion as to:

(i)   the quantum of the sentence the Court was proposing to impose; and

(ii)   what quantum of sentence would be “appealable”.

(5)   The Court erred in increasing the quantum of the sentence the Court proposed to impose consequent on its discussions with (and opinions given by) the Crown (noted above in Ground 5) (sic)

(6)   The sentence imposed was, in all the circumstances, manifestly excessive.”

Ground 1: Mid-range of Seriousness


	
	The applicant submits that in light of the fact that the applicant’s actions on 5 April 2013 were not pre-meditated but spontaneous, that there was no significant harm caused to the victim, and the nature of the applicant’s attempts to set the petrol alight were such that they were not persisted with, the offence was lower than the mid‑range of objective seriousness.
	
	
	As well, the applicant submitted that by comparison with the conduct, the subject of the decision of this Court in Dinh, there were many features which did not exist in the factual circumstances here which, if they were present, would have positioned the seriousness of the offending at or above the mid-range.
	
	
	In conclusion, the applicant submitted:
	


“… that by failing to really look at the range of actions that were absent in this matter, to properly assess where in that range the actions of this appellant truly sat, in accordance with the principals in R v Dinh …, the Court’s assessment of the appellant’s conduct as being mid-range was flawed, resulting in a ‘starting point’ (and subsequent sentence) that was unreasonable or plainly unjust.”


	
	The Crown submitted that, contrary to the applicant’s submission, the applicant’s attempts to light the petrol were serious and persistent, and that those attempts were only thwarted by the intervention of the three teenagers. Even after their intervention, the Crown submits, the applicant attempted to continue to light the petrol.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the absence of any significant physical injury was an irrelevant consideration in assessing the seriousness of the criminality. The Crown submitted that if significant injury had been sustained, then a different charge would likely follow. It was correct, the Crown submitted, for the sentencing Judge to conclude that the absence of actual bodily harm is not a mitigating factor.
	
	
	Finally, the Crown submitted that, having regard to the principles in Dinh, the sentencing Judge approached the assessment correctly, noting that the objective seriousness for an offence against s 47 of the Crimes Act is to be determined by the established facts. The Crown submitted that no error has been demonstrated.
	
	
	This Court is, and always has been, very slow to intervene in a sentencing Judge’s evaluation as to the degree of objective seriousness of an offence.
	
	
	In Mulato v R [2006] NSWCCA 282 at [37], Spigelman CJ said:
	


“Characterisation of the degree of objective seriousness of an offence is classically within the role of the sentencing Judge in performing the task of finding facts and drawing inferences from those facts. This Court is very slow to determine such matters for itself, or to set aside the judgment made by a first instance judge exercising a broadly based discretion. The question must be whether or not a particular characterisation which her Honour gave to the circumstances of the offence, was open to her Honour.”


	
	In the same decision, Simpson J said at [46] this:
	


“The assessment of the objective seriousness of an offence is quintessentially for the sentencing Judge. It is, if not a finding of fact, then the exercise of an evaluative process akin to fact finding or the exercise of a discretion. As such it is reviewable in this Court only on the principle stated in House v The King [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499. The importance of respecting the role of the first instance Judge should never be underestimated. It is not the function of this court to substitute its own view of objective seriousness for that of the first instance Judge. That is not because objective seriousness is something determined by reference to the evaluation of the credibility of witnesses, in respect of which it is conventionally held that the first instance Judge is in a superior position. It is because it is a fundamental aspect of the appellate system. Each judicial officer in the hierarchy has his or her own function, and those at appellate level need to take care not to trespass upon the role of those at first instance.”


	
	In order to consider fully the applicant’s submissions, it is necessary to have regard to the principles stated by this Court in Dinh. At [46], Johnson J (with whom Basten JA and Howie J agreed), said:
	


“[46]   When an offence, such as that under s 47, is defined to include any of several categories of conduct, the seriousness of the conduct in a particular case depends not on the statute defining the offence, but on the facts of the case. In the case of a s 47 offence, a sentencing Judge has to consider where the facts of the particular case lie in a spectrum, at one end of which lies the worst type of offence perpetrated by any act which constitutes a s 47 offence as defined.”


	
	The terms of s 47, on their face, make it plain that the offence is complete whether a person suffers bodily injury as a consequence of the conduct of the offender or not. The offence is one of undertaking an act, in this case pouring petrol (an explosive substance) over a person, whilst having an intent to burn.
	
	
	Here, not only were the elements of that offence satisfied by the plea of guilty, but the evidence overwhelmingly established those elements. In particular, the persistent but thwarted attempts by the applicant to set alight to the petrol, demonstrated his intention to burn his wife.
	
	
	The facts of and surrounding this offence are, in my view, of obvious seriousness. The applicant followed the victim who was driving her elderly mother home to her parents’ place. He parked his car directly behind where her car was stopped. He approached the driver’s side of the car where the victim was sitting, opened the door, assaulted the victim and damaged her mobile phone which was the tool for summoning police assistance. The victim was pulled out of the car, and stood over by the applicant. When confronted by the neighbouring teenagers and told to let go of the victim, the applicant did so but, fetched the petrol, prevented his wife from escaping him by chasing after her and physically restraining her, then poured the contents of the jerry can of petrol over her head and produced matches intending to light the petrol.
	
	
	He was thwarted. He then made a second attempt, this time pouring the petrol contents onto the driveway so that it ran down to the victim and under the car where her mother was sitting. He made further attempts to light that petrol. His offending only ceased when one of the teenaged neighbours, in effect, contained him within his vehicle. He then fled the scene.
	
	
	Accepting, as his Honour did, that this was not a pre-meditated offence, nevertheless the facts demonstrate that the offending was serious. The fact that no physical injury ensued was due entirely to the intervention of three teenagers.
	
	
	In my view, the finding of his Honour that this offence was in the mid-range was, if anything, unduly favourable to the applicant. However, the fact that I form a view of the objective seriousness is, as the authorities demonstrate, not to the point.
	
	
	The question is whether it was open to his Honour to have come to the conclusion which he did. In my view, it was. The facts which I have just outlined are more than sufficient to support the conclusion to which his Honour came.
	
	
	I would not uphold this ground.
	


Grounds 2 and 3


	
	The applicant combines these grounds in his submissions. It is to be remembered that in Ground 2 the applicant complained that the Court erred in finding that there was no evidence of any direct causal connection between the applicant’s offending and his major depressive illness.
	
	
	It is convenient to deal with this Ground first. The Crown resists a finding of error. It notes that in the proceedings on sentence, the applicant’s legal representative did not make any submission that there was a causal connection. In the course of the Crown submissions, a discussion between the sentencing Judge and the Crown occurred on the subject. His Honour ventured the view that there was no such causal connection. The Crown notes that after that exchange, the applicant’s legal representative made further submissions, but did not suggest to the contrary of that view.
	
	
	The sentencing Judge was in a difficult position when considering this question of whether the applicant’s depressive illness had a causal connection with this conduct. The evidence from the applicant was that he could not remember his offending conduct. He did not attempt to give any explanation for it himself. The highest which any explanation for his conduct rose to on this day, was an available inference that, having accidentally and unintentionally seen his wife, the applicant followed her to her parents’ home because he wanted to talk to her. That inference is available from his previous attempts to discuss with his wife their separation, in the context of her unwillingness so to do.
	
	
	The expert report of Dr Furst seems to reason that a causal connection existed by reason of the co-existence of the depressive illness and the conduct, the subject of the offence.
	
	
	In describing a major depressive disorder, Dr Furst suggests that the disorder is a disabling condition that has an adverse impact on a person’s ability to work or study, their family life, sleeping and eating habits and general health. He notes that depressed individuals may be preoccupied with, or ruminate over, thoughts and feelings of worthlessness, inappropriate guilt or regret, helplessness, hopelessness and self-hatred.
	
	
	Some of those symptoms were noted by Dr Furst as having existed in the applicant prior to the offence. Dr Furst had previously recorded in summary, the nature of the conduct, giving rise to the offence. He noted that the applicant was able to make coherent statements “of an angry nature to the victim and her mother”. He noted that there was no reason to conclude that the applicant was mentally ill within the legal test at the time of the offence. He then went on to express his opinion that it was likely that the applicant acted on impulse at the time of offences in question:
	


“in response to his severe depression, feelings of anger and inability to come to terms with his marital separation. He may well have struggled to control himself at the time”.


	
	The reasoning for the connection between a disorder, which has the consequences to which I have earlier referred, and the conduct in question, is absent from the report of Dr Furst. There is an obvious causal connection between anger on the part of the applicant, and his conduct. His statements at the time are evidence of that causal connection.
	
	
	The mere statement of a causal connection with the depressive disorder by Dr Furst, in terms which would otherwise be described as an ipse dixit is not persuasive. The fact that the applicant’s lawyer at the sentencing hearing did not make any submission with respect to such a causal connection suggests also that there was a less than convincing connection between the two.
	
	
	It was a matter for the sentencing Judge to assess, as to whether he accepted, on the balance of probabilities, the opinion of Dr Furst. His Honour made known his tentative view in the course of the Crown submissions. The applicant’s lawyer did not seek to dissuade his Honour from that view, or even raise it with him, in submissions in reply.
	
	
	I am not satisfied that in all of the circumstances, there was any error in his Honour declining to accept the existence of the causal connection postulated by Dr Furst. It was, on any view, speculation rather than reasoned opinion. I would not uphold Ground 2.
	
	
	Ground 3 complains that the sentence imposed, while accounting for the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty, failed to take into account:
	


“other factors in mitigation that were not taken into account by the Court in the finding of special circumstances”.


	
	The applicant listed the following matters as being matters which ought to have but which were not, explicitly, taken into account in mitigation of the offence. They were these:
	



	
	the applicant’s expression of remorse, both immediately after the incident to hospital staff, and then during his evidence on sentence;
	
	
	the fact that he accepted responsibility and entered the plea of guilty despite his lack of memory of committing the offence;
	
	
	the fact of the applicant’s apparent mental breakdown and major depressive illness, which does not appear to have been reflected in the sentence even though the Court said that it was taken in account;
	
	
	the fact that the applicant was co-operative with police on the arrest;
	
	
	the fact that the applicant did not have a serious and/or extensive criminal record for a man of his age.
	



	
	The Crown submitted that the applicant’s submission arises from a mistaken understanding of the way in which the sentencing Judge structured his sentencing remarks.
	
	
	It is correct, as the applicant submits, that the sentencing Judge, towards the end of his sentence, and having dealt with the matters on the s 166 Certificate, did commence by saying:
	


“I propose to start this sentence at a term of 10 years and discount it by 25% leaving a sentence of 7½ years”.


	
	The applicant submitted that this phrasing demonstrates that his Honour failed to have regard to any mitigating factors.
	
	
	The difficulty with this submission is that, immediately prior to his Honour expressing himself in this way, his Honour made clear reference to the purposes of sentencing set out in s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, and made specific reference to having considered the provisions of s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act “… both in terms of mitigating and aggravating factors”.
	
	
	Earlier, in the course of his Remarks, his Honour had comprehensively referred to both the objective circumstances and the subjective circumstances engaged in this sentencing exercise. With respect to the applicant’s mental condition, and his major depressive illness, his Honour noted that it was a relevant factor, and that general deterrence was not as significant as it otherwise might be. Once his Honour had, correctly in my view, discounted any causal connection, this was the appropriate approach to this matter.
	
	
	It is correct, as the applicant submits, in the Discharge Summary of the Mental Health Unit of Gosford Hospital, there is a record that the applicant expressed remorse for his conduct. However, the applicant’s evidence, given during the sentencing proceedings, cast considerable doubt upon that. It was only towards the end of his evidence that the applicant was prepared to express any remorse whatsoever for what he had done. There is no reason to think that his Honour’s conclusion, expressed at it was, did not reflect a reasonable finding on the facts.
	
	
	There is no reason to think that the applicant’s prior good record was disregarded by his Honour. When recounting the circumstances leading up to the sentencing hearing, his Honour specifically noted that the applicant was entitled to be treated as a person of good character. In light of that specific statement, I would not be prepared to conclude that his Honour ignored that fact when considering the appropriate sentence to impose.
	
	
	The applicant submits that the fact that he was co-operative with police on arrest should be taken into account in mitigation of his offence.
	
	
	Section 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act provides that, in accordance with s 23, the provision of assistance to law enforcement authorities is entitled to be regarded as a mitigating factor.
	
	
	Here, the evidence did not suggest any provision of assistance to authorities. It merely suggested that the applicant, having been arrested, agreed to participate in an electronically recorded interview, and gave an account of the incident. Beyond that, there is no factual material to support any conclusion of co-operation or assistance. The mere fact that an applicant participates in an electronically recorded interview about the incident, the subject of the offence, even though not obliged to, is not a matter which is entitled to any weight, of itself, in mitigation of any sentence. If it were otherwise one would, in effect, be running the risk of imposing a punishment upon someone who exercised their right to silence.
	
	
	There was no reason for the sentencing Judge to have had regard to any mitigating effect, in the circumstances of this case, from the mere fact that the accused participated in an electronically recorded interview.
	
	
	The fact that the applicant was effectively a person of good character prior to the domestic violence offence committed against his wife in 2013 was taken into account.
	
	
	I see no reason to conclude that his Honour failed to have regard to any of these factors to which the applicant calls attention, when deciding what penalty ought be imposed. I would not uphold Ground 3.
	


Grounds 4 and 5


	
	These grounds can be dealt with together. They suggest that error is to be found in the process of sentencing because the Judge exposed to the Crown his tentative view as to an appropriate sentence and, in effect, invited the Crown to comment upon it, and then took into account the Crown’s submissions. The grounds suggest inappropriate conduct on the part of the Crown.
	
	
	It is necessary to set out, unfortunately at some length, the context to the discussions between the sentencing Judge and the Crown, and then those discussions.
	
	
	It is to be recalled that the applicant was taken into custody on 5 April 2013. The sentencing proceedings took place on 2 May 2014. That is to say, about 13 months after the applicant had been taken into custody. He had been on remand, and not admitted to bail, for the whole of that period.
	
	
	In the course of the submissions by the applicant’s lawyer, the following was put to the Court:
	


“Hanrahan:   … and that it’s had to take a serious intervention as has occurred in this case for there to be a change in that course of behaviour. We would submit your Honour that this man has served sufficient time in jail for him to be given a release, not a total release your Honour, perhaps in some way on a tight lead … either under a suspended sentence or on some form of supervised management of him in the community, but there is an opportunity for society to benefit more from a man who has recognised his wrongs and been able to recover from them, and deal with them properly, rather than be kept in jail and to be exposed to the kind of dangers that he has to date been exposed to there. I know it is a difficult situation your Honour, but this is not the sort of person, in my submission, who should be in jail. …”


	
	The submissions continued for some further time, and at the conclusion of them, the applicant’s lawyer said:
	


“And in those circumstances your Honour, I renew my application to allow this man to remain in the community under careful supervision.”


	
	In short, the applicant’s lawyer was, at that stage, submitting that a 13 month non-parole period ought to be imposed.
	
	
	At that point in time, the Crown was called upon to address and make submissions. The lawyer appearing for the Crown first addressed the question of the seriousness of the offence. He commenced by reminding the Court that the offence carried a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment, and submitted that this offence was a serious one. He then summarised the facts which supported that submission.
	
	
	The lawyer for the Crown went on to say this:
	


“Your Honour, in offending of this nature, in my submission, issues of specific and general deterrence loom large. It is in the context of a domestic relationship, continuous breaches of those, the AVO and the Court orders, not just in relation to that general deterrence, but also that specific deterrence in relation to this offender sending that, and communicating to him, the significance of this offence.”


	
	His Honour then adjourned for lunch. During the luncheon adjournment his Honour read the judgments in the matters of Dinh and three other District Court cases which had been referred to in Dinh. Upon return, the Crown lawyer’s submissions continued. They drew his Honour’s attention to the fact that the cases provided had some significant differences with the one standing for sentence. His Honour’s attention was drawn to the statements of principle in Dinh, and a discussion ensued between the Bench and the Crown lawyer about various of the facts in this matter.
	
	
	Having outlined various of the matters of fact, and other issues for consideration, his Honour went on to say:
	


“But I would have to say, and I’ll give Mr Hanrahan another opportunity, I’d have to say that Mr Hanrahan and I are a fair way apart in terms of what he’s advocating as the outcome and what I consider to be an appropriate sentence.

I mean against the background of 25 years, and in my view that it is a serious example of this offence in the sense that it is at least in the mid-range, probably the upper end of the mid-range, and he gets 25% discount, but, you know, he is still looking, I am still looking at a starting point for the sentences, maybe somewhere between 8 and 10 years with a discount of 25% obviously, that, well on 10 years it brings it back to 7½, and on 8 years it brings it back to 6. And then no one has addressed on this, but there is an issue of special circumstances I need to consider … which probably apply I would have thought bearing in mind his age, first time in custody etc, etc.”


	
	The Crown agreed that it would be appropriate for the Court to find special circumstances, notwithstanding issues which he had previously raised. The Crown then reminded his Honour that he needed to note the Form 1 offences, and give them proper consideration. The Crown reminded his Honour that he also had to deal with the matters on the s 166 Certificate. All of these submissions were entirely appropriate.
	
	
	There was then considerable discussion as to the appropriate approach to be taken with respect to the offences that were referred to in the certificate under s 166 of the Criminal Procedure Act. The Crown was careful to ensure that his Honour was reminded that he ought not consider the same conduct twice when dealing both with the principal offence and the offences contained in the certificate under s 166.
	
	
	There was then further discussion between the Bench and the Crown about the particular facts, and the nature of the aggravating circumstances. At the end of that discussion, his Honour turned to the applicant’s legal representative, Mr Hanrahan, and said:
	


“His Honour:   Well, perhaps I’ll just heard [sic] from Mr Hanrahan again, Mr Hanrahan, there is no point in my imposing upon your client a sentence of imprisonment that would be successfully appealed by the Crown.

Hanrahan:   Yes I understand that your Honour, I appreciate that.

His Honour:   I certainly think that if I was to sentence him to a term of imprisonment which then ended up meaning that he had a non-parole period that brought about a fairly immediate release, that not only would the Crown appeal, but the Crown would be successful on appeal, which is really the pertinent point and the question is, what is the minimum, I’m prepared to give him, the least amount that is called for, because he has, I mean there is some, while I don’t accept its provocation, there is at least some explanation and some understanding after long years of marriage and the frustrations that were clearly occurring in his life in relation to what was happening. But, it is still not, against a 25 year maximum penalty, the only thing that’s really missing is pre-meditation from making it -

Hanrahan:   And that’s the most significant thing your Honour I mean -

His Honour:   I agree it’s significant, but it’s the only thing that’s missing from making it up in the sort of most serious range.

Hanrahan:   Yes it is that’s right and the kind of pre-meditation that was involved in the Dinh case was extreme.

... ”


	
	This was followed by more discussion between the applicant’s lawyer and the Bench about the seriousness of the offence, the nature of the intent which was disclosed and whether the applicant’s conduct ought be regarded as being mitigated to the extent that his wife, the victim, had precipitated it by declining to speak with him.
	
	
	The following exchange then occurred:
	


“His Honour:   Yes. Well I mean it’s just a case of trying to find where the range is, he doesn’t want to go anywhere else, the Crown doesn’t want to go anywhere else, but I’d like to get it right. I don’t think giving him a non-parole period, well I know giving him a non-parole period of 12 months is not within range, the question is where is the bottom of the range.

Hanrahan:   Could I suggest your Honour that it not be twice that, that that would be somewhere within the range, having regard to those other matters that we’ve looked at. But in all the objective circumstances that it would fit in that category somewhere under the two year mark … whether that be the top or the bottom, somewhere around that.

His Honour:   I’ll see if Mr Crown can help me on that, I don’t know, I don’t think …

Crown:   Your Honour’s quite correct when your Honour said that it’s    a difficult exercise that your Honour has because none of those cases do set out a sentencing principle in terms of quantum in any way that your Honour could be guided by and again that case of Dinh that I provided to your Honour was for the comments on the nature of sentencing that type.

His Honour:      Yes.

Crown:   In my submission your Honour, that is of little benefit to compare this case to that.

His Honour:      No, the numbers don’t help for this -

Crown:   No, that’s not to suggest that your Honour couldn’t consider similar aggravating features or that but your Honour’s task I think as your Honour has already articulated is that those guideposts that your Honour mentioned, that is the maximum penalty, the nature of those aggravating features, those sorts of things are what your Honour has to go on if I can …

…

Crown:   Yes, and I accept it’s difficult from the Crown’s perspective to give your Honour that guidance in terms of quantum. … the reason is that those who are successful aren’t charged with this offence. So just in one perspective of where your Honour places this in terms of criminality I don’t think I would cavil greatly with what your Honour said, that the intent is very significant in terms of this offence. …

…

Crown:   In relation to the intent though, that is a significant example under this offence because of those multiple attempts and because they are only stopped by the intervention of a third party. In my respectful submission, your Honour wouldn’t accept that it was any positive act on the part of the accused that ended this. …

…

Crown:   It’s not so here, and it is only again stopped by those physical interventions. And that is in my submission quite a significant factor in relation to an offence of this type. It’s true that the petrol doesn’t cause severe burns that for instance caustic acid would, but if lit it can take matters quite significantly further. So there’s obviously a significant fear there and that’s why, whilst there is different offences that are categorised under the section, they all carry that penalty of 25 years in my respectful submission.”


	
	Further submission occurred in which the Crown drew attention to various features surrounding the offence. The following exchange then took place:
	


“Crown:   Your Honour just for the record, I don’t know if it’s necessary but in my submission from the Crown’s perspective the course that my friend urged would be, as your Honour has already indicated …

His Honour:   I think it’s appealable error if I was to do that.

Crown:   … would have your Honour sliding into that area.

His Honour:   The real question is not so much the head sentence but the real question is what’s the minimum time he’s got to serve. Mr Hanrahan’s now saying two years, whereas I was probably thinking, well even it was to start with eight, that brings it back to six and the best he could probably get there would be three, even if it was three + three. Then it could easily be four + two-.

Crown:   Your Honour if your Honour accepts my submissions in relation to the overall criminality of the matter I suppose and your Honour is then considering of course the Forms 1 and those sorts of other aggravating features. In my respectful submission my friend’s revised position would still cause your Honour in looking against the backdrop of that 25 year …

His Honour:   It is, that’s why I’m asking you.

Crown:   Yes, your Honour. It would still cause your Honour to fall into appealable error. That is the revised, that is the two years. As your Honour knows, it is of course a matter for your Honour. I hope I can be of some assistance.

His Honour:   Yeah, well it’s not as if you’re standing her [sic] advocating a course, you’re standing her [sic] responding to a request for assistance in terms of each of us might have a view as to what the range is obviously and in a case such as this, it’s helpful to have as many views upon that as possible, ultimately, it will be my view that counts and if it goes anywhere else by way of a Crown or defence appeal, it will be for the CCA.

Crown:   Yes.

His Honour:   But getting as much input as possible hopefully increases the chances that it’s done, or that it’s got right the first time. Does the Crown say that a non‑parole period of three and a half years would be outside the range?

Crown:   I would submit to your Honour that having regard to that maximum penalty and the degree of criminality and the intent and those aggravating features that yes it would your Honour. Your Honour also has those issues as I’ve noted, there are of conditional liberty, those other matters that I’ve raised with your Honour.

His Honour:   Yes, I thank you Mr Crown.”


	
	The sentencing Judge gave the applicant’s lawyer an opportunity to be heard further. Nothing of substance emerged from that discussion.
	
	
	In Barbaro v The Queen; Zirilli v The Queen [2014] HCA 2; (2014) 88 ALJR 372, the High Court held that the Victorian practice of counsel for the prosecution providing a submission about the bounds of the available range of sentences in any particular matter, was wrong in principle. The practice referred to, involved counsel for the prosecution specifying in numerical terms, a range for a head sentence, and in some cases, a range for a non-parole period also in numerical terms.
	
	
	In the judgment of the majority (French CJ, Hayne, Kiefel and Bell JJ), the dangers in such a practice were identified. At [33], their Honours said:
	


“The statement by the prosecution of the bounds of an available range of sentences may lead to erroneous views about its importance in the process of sentencing with consequential blurring of what should be a sharp distinction between the role of the judge and the role of the prosecution in that process. If a judge sentences within the range which has been suggested by the prosecution, the statement of that range may well be seen as suggesting that the sentencing judge has been swayed by the prosecution’s view of what punishment should be imposed. By contrast, if the sentencing judge fixes a sentence outside the suggested range, an appeal against sentences seems well-nigh inevitable.”


	
	However, the judgment of the High Court in Barbaro is not authority for the proposition that the obligation of a prosecutor to render assistance to the Court has been entirely removed. The contrary is the case. In CMB v Attorney General for New South Wales [2015] HCA 9; (2015) 89 ALJR 407, French CJ and Gaegeler J, said at [38]:
	


“The Crown (by whomever it is represented) has a duty to assist a sentencing court to avoid appealable error. That duty would be hollow were it not to remain rare that an ‘appellate court’ would intervene on an appeal against sentence to correct an alleged error by increasing the sentence if the Crown had not done what was reasonably required to assist the sentencing Judge to avoid error.”: R v Tait (1979) 24 ALR 473 at 477.


	
	The plurality (Kiefel, Bell and Keane JJ) were of a like view. At [64], their Honours said:
	


“The determination of the appropriate sentence is one that rests solely with the Court. The public interest in the sentencing of offenders, does not permit the parties to bind the Court by their agreement. Nonetheless, the prosecutor is under a duty to assist the Court to avoid appealable error. Where the sentencing Judge indicates the form of proposed sentencing order and the prosecutor considers that such a penalty would be manifestly inadequate, the prosecutor discharges his or her duty to the Court by so submitting. The failure to do so is a material consideration in the exercise by the Court of Criminal Appeal of the residual discretion. The weight of that consideration will depend upon all of the circumstances. A prosecution concession that a non‑custodial sentence is an available disposition is a powerful consideration weighing against intervening to impose a sentence of imprisonment on appeal.” (footnotes omitted)


	
	Nowhere in the exchanges which I have quoted at length, did the Crown advocate any range of penalty by way of a term of imprisonment in any numerical sense, or at all. The Crown was careful to draw the attention of the Court to various of the facts and the aggravating circumstances. He was careful to ensure that the sentencing Judge understood that he was not contending that the cases, copies of which had been given it his Honour, were directly in point. The only submission which the prosecutor made, was that the Court would fall into appealable error if a sentence reflecting either of the two alternate proposals which the applicant’s lawyer had advanced, was imposed. To that extent, the prosecutor did precisely what the High Court suggests his duty ought be.
	
	
	If, as it is said occurred, the sentencing Judge, having given an indication of his thinking as to a sentence, invites submissions and then reconsiders what the sentence ought be, provided that the offender’s lawyer is given an opportunity to be heard, as occurred in this case, there can be no error of process, or error of substance.
	
	
	I would not uphold Grounds 4 and 5.
	


Grounds 6: Manifest Excess


	
	This ground arises for consideration in the context that the applicant has not persuaded the Court that there has been any identifiable discrete or specific error of the kind raised in the previous grounds. Nevertheless, it is open to an applicant to submit, and this applicant submits, that:
	


“Having regard to the objective criminality of the offence, together with the appellant’s subjective features, this Court would still find that the sentencing Judge failed to properly exercise his sentencing discretion on the basis that the sentence ultimately imposed was ‘plainly unjust or unreasonable’. ”


	
	Here, the objective seriousness of the offending was categorised as in the mid-range in a manner which was open to the sentencing judge. The offending occurred in the context of a breach of an ADVO, and a breach of a number of bonds under s 10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act which had been imposed only a few weeks before this event. Any sentence to be imposed needed also to take into account four offences which were placed on the Form 1 schedule.
	
	
	It needs also to be kept in mind, that until the time of his separation, the applicant had not been convicted of any criminal offences. However, his conduct after separation had led to him being before the Courts on a number of occasions.
	
	
	The maximum term of imprisonment fixed by the legislature with respect to this offence demonstrates the legislature’s view that the offence is a serious one.
	
	
	Notwithstanding the mitigating factors which were available, and the subjective case of the applicant, I am not able to conclude that the sentence itself reflects error, that it was unreasonable, nor that it was one that was not lawfully open to the sentencing Judge to impose, and accordingly, I would not uphold this ground.
	


Summary


	
	I have read and agree with the observations of Johnson J.
	
	
	I have not been persuaded that there has been any error of the kinds asserted with respect to the sentencing Judge’s conclusions, nor have I been persuaded that the sentence itself bespeaks error on the basis that it is not a sentence which could lawfully have been imposed. These conclusions would lead to the appeal being dismissed.
	
	
	However, for the reasons which immediately follow, it is necessary that the application be granted and the appeal be upheld, and for the applicant to be resentenced. The sentence which is to be imposed is the same as that imposed by the sentencing Judge.
	


Error in Commencement Date


	
	The sentencing Judge fixed the commencement date as 8 April 2013.
	
	
	The applicant was actually taken into custody on 5 April 2013, and then was taken to the Mental Health Unit at Gosford Hospital, where he was detained pursuant to the mental health legislation.
	
	
	The Crown concedes that custody commenced on 5 April 2013, and the sentence ought to have been dated from that day.
	
	
	Accordingly, the Court will uphold the appeal for the purpose of correcting such error, and will resentence the applicant accordingly.
	


Orders


	
	I make the following orders:
	



	
	Application for leave to appeal granted.
	
	
	Appeal allowed.
	
	
	Set aside the sentence imposed by Ellis DCJ in the District Court of NSW on 2 May 2014.
	
	
	In lieu of that sentence, impose the following sentence:
	



	
	The applicant is sentenced to a term of imprisonment for 7 years and 6 months to commence on 5 April 2013 and to expire on 4 October 2020.
	
	
	A non-parole period of 4 years commencing on 5 April 2013 and expiring on 4 April 2017 is fixed.
	



	
	The applicant is not to be released to parole before the expiry of his non‑parole period.

		17 June 2015",2015-06-16 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2703245,R v Joffe; R v Stromer [2015] NSWSC 741,"Judgment


	
	Daniel Shayne Joffe has pleaded guilty to two counts of procuring Nathan Stromer to acquire relevant securities whilst in possession of inside information, contrary to ss 1043A(1)(d) and 1311(1) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth).
	
	
	Nathan Stromer has pleaded guilty to two counts of acquiring the relevant securities whilst in possession of inside information, contrary to s 1043A(1)(c) and 1311(1) of the Corporations Act.
	
	
	At the time of the offending the offences carried a maximum penalty of imprisonment for five years and/or a fine of $220,000. (The maximum penalty was increased to 10 years with effect from 13 December 2010.)
	
	
	The offender Joffe also admits his guilt in respect of a further offence against s 1043(1)(d) of procuring the acquisition by Stromer of relevant securities. His guilt in respect of that offence is to be taken into account in relation to the second of the offences to which he has pleaded guilty.
	
	
	The first offence for each offender involved Joffe procuring Stromer in August 2006 to acquire 29,580 shares in Auckland International Airport Limited whilst in possession of inside information.
	
	
	The second offence for each offender concerns the procurement by Joffe of Stromer in November 2006 to acquire 962,000 Contracts for Difference (“CFDs”) in Alinta Infrastructure Holdings whilst in possession of inside information.
	
	
	The offence that the offender Joffe asks to be taken into account concerns his procurement of Stromer in September 2006 to acquire 135,000 CFDs in AWB Limited whilst in possession of inside information.
	


Facts


	
	A very lengthy and detailed “Joint Statement of Agreed Facts on Sentence” was tendered from which I derive the following.
	
	
	At the time of the offences, Joffe and Stromer were close friends who had known each other for at least ten years.
	
	
	Joffe was employed at Moody’s Investor Service Pty Ltd (""Moody's”) as an associate analyst. All analysts and associate analysts were required to read and understand Moody's trading policy. These included a “Prohibition Against Trading While Aware of Material Non Public Information”, a “Corporation Securities Trading Policy” and a “Code of Business Conduct”. There is no dispute that Joffe was aware at the time of his offending that what he was doing was contrary to the expectations of his employer and contrary to law.
	
	
	Stromer was employed in his father's business which was involved with property development and aged care. Investing and trading in securities was an interest he shared with his father. More will be said later about his relationship with his father.
	


Auckland International Airport


	
	In March 2006, Babcock and Brown received a proposal from Deutsche Bank to consider a proposal for a possible takeover of Auckland International Airport (""Auckland Airport""). The proposal was given a codename (Project Nimbus) to ensure its confidentiality.
	
	
	Babcock and Brown approached Moody’s about the possibility of engaging Moody’s to perform a rating assessment service in relation to the airport. A senior analyst from Moody's, as well as Joffe who was an associate analyst, attended a meeting on 3 July 2006 with representatives of Babcock and Brown and Deutsche Bank. They were provided with a discussion paper headed ""Project Nimbus"" and given some details of the proposed transaction to make a bid for an airport. The actual airport concerned was not identified.
	
	
	There was a further meeting on 1 August 2006 attended by the same personnel during which the identity of the airport was disclosed. This information was material and was not generally available within the meaning of Div 3 of Pt 7.10 of the Corporations Act.
	
	
	The representative of Babcock and Brown indicated that there were a number of factors to overcome before the engagement of Moody’s was formalised. Specifically, two local councils owned 21 per cent of Auckland Airport and Babcock and Brown required a recommendation from the airport’s board (i.e. that there be a “friendly takeover”).
	
	
	The statement of facts includes that, “the [Auckland Airport] information was not specific in terms of timing, takeover structure or bid price. However, a person who commonly acquired Div 3 financial products would be influenced by the … information to acquire [Auckland Airport] securities between 1 and 8 August 2006”.
	
	
	At some time in the week following this meeting Joffe communicated the Auckland Airport information to Stromer, thereby procuring Stromer to acquire shares contrary to s 1043A(1)(d) of the Corporations Act. On 8 August, Stromer bought 29,580 shares at $1.6972 through his broker whilst in possession of the information, contrary to s 1043A(1)(c) of the Corporations Act.
	
	
	On 12 September 2006, Joffe received an email from a fellow Moody’s employee advising, “All is not going to plan for B&B. They are still ‘in negotiations’ with Auckland Airport management and are not sure what the outcome will be”. Immediately thereafter, there were a number of communications passing between Joffe and Stromer and, a couple of minutes after the last of these, Stromer placed an order with his broker to sell all of his Auckland Airport shares.
	
	
	After payment of commission and GST, Stromer made a pre-tax profit of $359.09 on the sale of the shares. This consisted of a gross trading gain of $1,193.99, less commission of $834.90. He had invested a total amount of $50,202.31.
	
	
	It is agreed between the parties that at all relevant times, Joffe knew, and Stromer knew, or ought reasonably to have known, that the Auckland Airport information was “inside information”, that is it was not generally available and, if it were generally available, a reasonable person would expect it to have a material effect on the price or value of financial products relating to that entity.
	


Australian Wheat Board Limited


	
	Joffe asks that his guilt in respect of an offence concerning Australian Wheat Board Limited (""the Wheat Board"") be taken into account. This company managed and marketed wheat and other grain exports from Australia and provided a range of services to the farming community. Moody’s rated the debt of AWB Harvest Finance, which was a subsidiary of the Wheat Board. In 2006, Joffe and David Howell were the Moody’s associate analyst and analyst respectively for AWB Harvest Finance.
	
	
	On Thursday 14 September 2006, Joffe received an email from David Howell attaching a “pre-meeting” pack of information relating to the Wheat Board in preparation for a meeting with representatives of the Wheat Board on Wednesday 20 September 2006. The information within the pre-meeting pack was sourced from material in the public domain.
	
	
	On Friday 15 September 2006 and over the following weekend, Joffe and Stromer communicated by phone and text message on nine occasions.
	
	
	At about 3.00pm on Monday 18 September 2006, Joffe attended a Wheat Board pre-meeting with Moody’s officers in preparation for the proposed meeting with the Wheat Board representatives on the Wednesday. Prior to the pre-meeting he viewed a Sydney Morning Herald article on the internet relating to the Wheat Board and viewed its share price on the CommSec website. He did so again after the meeting.
	
	
	The meeting of Joffe and other Moody's representatives with personnel from the Wheat Board took place during the afternoon of Wednesday 20 September 2006. The Moody's representatives were informed that the Wheat Board was considering announcing to the Australian Securities Exchange (“ASX”) that it would indemnify AWB (International) Limited for its legal costs arising from the Cole Inquiry and any potential tax that might be assessed against the Wheat Board in connection with transportation fees paid for wheat sold to Iraq. Such tax was estimated, on a worst-case scenario, to be approximately $259 million as at 30 September 2006. The Moody's representatives were also told that below average rainfall was affecting domestic wheat production and, that if the drought continued, there may be further downgrades to the wheat production forecast. (This was the “the Wheat Board information”.)
	
	
	The Wheat Board’s most recent market guidance and wheat crop forecast for domestic wheat production for the 2006/2007 crop (18-20 million tonnes) was no longer correct and the ABARE (Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics) forecast production of 16.4 million tonnes was more accurate. This information was already known to the market.
	
	
	The Wheat Board indicated to Moody's that it was of the belief that the probability of AWB International Limited incurring the tax liabilities referred to above was remote but that it was thought prudent to put the indemnity in place to reassure the wheat growers of their position.
	
	
	Joffe and Stromer were in telephone contact on a number of occasions later that night as well as on multiple occasions in the ensuing days and Joffe continued accessing internet sites relating to the Wheat Board.
	
	
	On the morning of Friday 22 September, Joffe sent an email to an officer of the Wheat Board requesting a draft copy of its proposed announcement regarding the indemnity. His contact with Stromer by telephone call and text messaging continued until the morning of Tuesday 27 September.
	
	
	On Monday 25 September, Stromer established a trading account with CMC Markets. On Tuesday 26 September his account was credited with payments from his bank account totalling $26,000. At around 10.45am on Wednesday 27 September, Stromer sold short 135,000 Wheat Board CFDs through his CMC account.
	
	
	The agreed facts include that it was between about 2.30pm on 20 September and 10.45am on 27 September that Joffe communicated the Wheat Board information to Stromer, thereby procuring Stromer to acquire financial products contrary to s 1043A(1)(d) of the Corporations Act.
	
	
	On Thursday 28 September, the Wheat Board made an announcement to the ASX announcing a reduction in the wheat production forecast for 2006/07 from 18-20 million tonnes to 12-15m tonnes. It also announced that the Wheat Board would indemnify AWB International for legal costs arising from the Cole Inquiry and any costs of contesting any ATO assessment of any outstanding tax in connection with inland transportation fees for wheat sold to Iraq. The Wheat Board’s share price closed on 28 September at $3.35 and opened the following morning at $3.32, closing that afternoon at $3.27.
	
	
	Communications between Stromer and Joffe continued by phone and text message throughout 27, 28 and 29 September.
	
	
	In two transactions on Friday 29 September, Stromer disposed of all of his Wheat Board CFDs. He made a pre-tax profit of $1,278.79. This consisted of a trading gain of $2,120 less commission and other fees of $841.21. Stromer had invested a total of $22,950 in the Wheat Board CFDs. He had been required by CMC to provide a margin equal to five per cent of the total exposure of the holding at any point in time. Accordingly, save for the highly unlikely event of an overnight rise in the Wheat Board share price greater than five per cent, Stromer’s likely maximum exposure was $22,950.
	
	
	The parties agree that at all relevant times Joffe knew that the Wheat Board information was “inside information”.
	


Alinta Infrastructure Holdings


	
	As at November 2006 Alinta Limited (""Alinta"") was the owner and manager of energy and infrastructure assets including gas, pipes and energy transmission lines. It also owned power generation assets. It had divested assets into Alinta Infrastructure Holdings (""Alinta Infrastructure"") but decided as part of a broader corporate strategy to consolidate all of its assets and acquire Alinta Infrastructure. The proposal to make the acquisition was given a code name (Project Wren/Little Duck) so as to preserve confidentiality in communication with the parties involved.
	
	
	On the afternoon of Friday 10 November 2006 the designated associate within Moody’s for Alinta (Adrian Atkins) received a telephone call from a person at Alinta advising of a proposal to announce a takeover bid for the partly paid issued securities of Alinta Infrastructure that it did not already own on 15 November 2006. (This was the “Alinta Infrastructure information”.) Joffe was not directly involved but became aware of the proposed takeover from discussions with Mr Atkins. A matter of minutes later, Joffe conducted a search on the CommSec website in relation to Alinta Infrastructure. While doing so, or immediately afterwards, he was in touch with Stromer.
	
	
	On the morning of 13 November 2006, Stromer telephoned CMC Markets and told a representative that he wanted to get money into his account. He spoke of the need to have the funds “cleared quite quickly”.
	
	
	Between about 3.30pm on 10 November and 11.45am on 13 November 2006, Joffe communicated the Alinta Infrastructure information to Stromer, thereby procuring Stromer to acquire financial products relating to that company, contrary to s 1043A(1)(d) of the Corporations Act. At about 11.45am on 13 November 2006, Stromer, whilst in possession of the Alinta Infrastructure information, commenced trading in Alinta Infrastructure CFDs with CMC Markets, acquiring 627,000 long CFDs that day contrary to s 1043A(1)(c) of the Corporations Act. At the time the price of the Alinta Infrastructure shares was $1.82.
	
	
	Whilst Stromer was engaged in that activity, Joffe was accessing the CommSec website for Alinta Infrastructure on a large number of occasions and he was in contact with Stromer that afternoon by way of multiple calls and texts.
	
	
	Also on the afternoon of 13 November 2006, Joffe withdrew $30,000 from his bank account by way of a bank cheque payable to Stromer and gave it to him that evening. The Crown contended that this represented Joffe’s intention to contribute to and share in the profits from Stromer's acquisition of CFDs in Alinta Infrastructure. However, Joffe claimed during a later investigation by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (“ASIC”) that it was a loan that Stromer had sought because he had said that he was experiencing short-term financial difficulties.
	
	
	The fact was, however, that Stromer had $141,000 in his bank account at the time and, the Crown contended, it was unlikely he would have deceived his friend Joffe. (Ultimately because of problems relating to the banking system, the $30,000 was not used by Stromer and was later returned to Joffe.) The timing of the provision of the $30,000 to Stromer was submitted by the Crown to be significant as well; it was the first business day after he had provided the inside information to Stromer and on the day that Stromer started acquiring CFDs in Alinta Infrastructure, with the deadline for the acquisitions being the expected takeover announcement in two days’ time.
	
	
	A further matter relied upon by the Crown was the accessing by Joffe of the CommSec website for Alinta Infrastructure. He did this within minutes of learning of the takeover bid on Friday 10 November 2006. He did so again on “a large number of occasions” on Monday 13 November, on the evening of which he provided Stromer with the $30,000 bank cheque. He did so again on eight occasions on the afternoon of Tuesday 14 November, the eve of the expected takeover bid announcement. The Crown submitted that this indicated an interest in the Alinta Infrastructure share price that was not evident previously in relation to the Auckland Airport matter and supported the contention that in respect of the Alinta Infrastructure matter he did so because he was intending to be financially interested.
	
	
	Despite there being no direct evidence of it, I think that it is not a matter of mere speculation, as contended by senior counsel for Joffe, that the $30,000 was intended by Joffe to represent him taking a financial interest into the ""investments"" made by Stromer. I am satisfied of this to the criminal standard.
	
	
	At around midday on 14 November 2006, Stromer acquired a further 245,000 long CFDs in Alinta Infrastructure.
	
	
	Shortly afterwards, a representative of CMC Markets telephoned Stromer and expressed concern as to whether he was aware that he had built up a significant position in relation to Alinta Infrastructure. Stromer was informed that a second instalment on the underlying CFDs would become due on 13 December and that if he did not close his position by then he would be liable for that payment. Stromer indicated that he would definitely close out the position before that date.
	
	
	Almost immediately after that conversation, Stromer spoke to another representative at CMC Markets and inquired about the price of long CFDs in Alinta Infrastructure, indicating that he wanted “as much as possible”. He was told the price was $1.95. He acquired a further 90,000. He then spoke with yet another CMC Markets representative indicating that he wanted more.
	
	
	Over the afternoon of 14 November and the following day, Joffe accessed the CommSec website for Alinta Infrastructure multiple times; accessed the ASX webpage relating to the latest ASX announcements; and was in contact with Stromer.
	
	
	Alinta Infrastructure shares closed on 14 November 2006 at $1.97.
	
	
	At 9.43am on 15 November 2006, Alinta made an announcement to the ASX: “Alinta announces cash offer for AIH”. Joffe telephoned Stromer minutes later. Alinta International shares opened at $2.06 that day and closed at $2.07.
	
	
	At 10.29am, a representative of Alinta emailed a copy of the ASX announcement to Moody’s associate analyst, Adrian Atkins. Half an hour later, Stromer sent a text message to Joffe. Eight minutes later he (Stromer) commenced selling 615,000 Alinta Infrastructure CFDs in twenty trades. He then telephoned Joffe and shortly afterwards sold a further 347,000 CFDs in four trades, thereby closing out his position in Alinta Infrastructure.
	
	
	Stromer realised a pre-tax profit of $182,770.32 from trading in Alinta Infrastructure CFDs. This consisted of a gross trading gain of $187,493 less commissions and financing fees of $4722.68. He had invested $94,757. CMC had required him to deposit a margin of 10 per cent of the total exposure of the holding at any point in time. The agreed facts include that save for the highly unlikely event of an overnight collapse in Alinta Infrastructure Holdings share price greater than 10 per cent, Stromer’s likely maximum exposure was $179,457.
	
	
	It is agreed between the parties that Joffe knew, and Stromer knew, or ought reasonably to have known, that the Alinta Infrastructure information was “inside information”.
	
	
	On 21 November 2006, a representative of CMC Markets informed Stromer that amounts relating to recent trading would have to be withheld pending an investigation.
	
	
	ASIC commenced its investigation into Stromer’s trading in Alinta Infrastructure on 8 December 2006 but did not communicate that fact to Joffe and Stromer at that time. On 19 December 2006, CMC advised Stromer that it was holding the funds in his CMC account (approximately $182,000) pending an investigation being conducted by the ASX. No proceeds from the Alinta Infrastructure transactions were ever paid by CMC to Stromer.
	
	
	A prosecution was commenced with the service of Court Attendance Notices in January 2010. Later I will say something more about what has occurred since then.
	


Personal circumstances – Nathan Stromer


	
	The offender Stromer did not give evidence at the sentence hearing. Expert reports, testimonials and other documentary material were tendered on his behalf.
	
	
	Stromer is 36 years old. He has experienced a difficult relationship with his parents, particularly his father who was described as volatile, a poor communicator and a bully. He was often critical and made the offender feel unworthy. Stromer told Dr Collins, psychologist, that he retreated into himself and felt timid and isolated.
	
	
	He was afforded a first class education at a private school and then went on to achieve law and commerce degrees at university. He worked for a major law firm and then as a management consultant before, somewhat ironically, commencing to work in his father's business in 2004. He remained there until he left and worked as an asset manager until September 2009. He has struggled to obtain employment since being charged. He has been engaged in selling wine from a call centre for the past few years.
	
	
	Stromer has been in a relationship with Ms Ping Ma for the past seven years or so. She gave birth to their child in January of this year. He described her to Dr Collins as “prosocial” and a “positive support”. She gave evidence (and provided a testimonial) which included some detail about various adverse ways in which the protracted proceedings and the uncertainty concerning the outcome had impinged on their lives.
	
	
	Dr Collins' report sets out the history provided by Stromer which included that he experienced depression and anxiety since childhood. He sought psychiatric help in 2001 after entertaining suicidal thoughts. He received treatment then and since from Dr Vlado Gojak. His mood was said to have improved in recent years but he was stressed over the current matter and the likely outcome. He was preoccupied with thoughts about how his partner will cope if he is imprisoned and was concerned about bonding with his new child if he received a custodial sentence. Dr Collins also reported that Stromer was socially avoidant; largely as a result of the reputational damage the offending caused his family.
	
	
	Dr Collins found that Stromer did not meet the criteria for any major mental illness. His depression had improved and was being well-managed with medication. There remained indicators of generalised anxiety.
	
	
	In relation to his mental state at the time of the offending, Dr Collins reported that his “mood and coping were reduced at the time … and he was suffering from generalised anxiety and major depression”. It was her view that “he would have been vulnerable and psychologically fragile at the time of the offences”.
	
	
	In her “formulation”, Dr Collins said that Stromer would have met the criteria for major depression and generalised anxiety disorder at the time of the offences which would have impacted his criminal conduct. I note that she did not clearly explain how this was so. She said his mental health had improved over time but that his mental state will deteriorate, she thought, should a custodial sentence be imposed. (I interpolate that this might be expected in anyone in Stromer’s position.)
	
	
	Dr Collins said that if Stromer is incarcerated there should be monitoring of his mental state over the short to medium term and a suicide risk assessment performed immediately when he is received into custody.
	
	
	Dr Collins did not consider Stromer to present a high risk of recidivism and suggested that any order that can incorporate a period of supervision will assist by observation of his mental health and general coping secondary to his sentencing.
	
	
	A report by Dr Vlado Gojak confirmed that Stromer first saw him in December 2001 complaining of depression and anxiety. Such conditions have endured on a fluctuating basis since. Dr Gojak prescribed antidepressant medication which Stromer has maintained. There was an increase in the intensity of Stromer's anxiety symptoms in 2006 (the year of the offending) when he engaged in a series of family therapy sessions. Dr Gojak last saw Stromer in 2012 but added that he continued to be prescribed antidepressant medication by his general practitioner.
	
	
	Stromer's mother gave evidence which, amongst other things, provided some further insight into the difficulties of the family dynamic. She said that the family therapy that was pursued in 2006 was unhelpful and probably put more stress on her son.
	
	
	Aside from these mental conditions, Stromer also suffers from Grave's disease, an autoimmune disease affecting the thyroid gland and causing it to become overactive. It is exacerbated by stress.
	
	
	Stromer was seen recently by Dr Stephen Allnutt. The history set out in his report is broadly consistent with that in Dr Collins' earlier report. Dr Allnutt considered that Stromer suffered from a recurrent depressive disorder and generalised anxiety disorder. He also manifested symptoms consistent with obsessive-compulsive personality disorder and possible obsessive-compulsive disorder, which are said to be different although with possibly overlapping conditions.
	
	
	Dr Allnutt considered that ""it would be reasonable to view [Stromer's] offending behaviour to have been motivated, at least partly, by an attempt to impress his father so as to gain his approval in an area of interest that he and his father shared. He would have been more prone to pursue this due to his underlying symptoms of depression and generalised anxiety disorder.""
	
	
	It was Dr Allnutt's opinion that Stromer was remorseful for his offending behaviour. He noted that he had sought to address his anxiety and depression in treatment with mental health professionals; had shown improvement in his mental state; and had a stable environment. He concluded that he would be at low risk of recidivism.
	
	
	The authors of the testimonials spoke positively (as one might expect) about the offender's various positive character traits. They also confirmed aspects of the history he had provided to the authors of the expert reports. His mother's testimonial displays much candour about the problems within the family, particularly in her description of her husband's ""highly aggressive manner"" and ""bullying"" towards her son. It must have been a very difficult document for her to compose. Stromer's sister described their father as ""overcritical, irrational, non-communicative, intolerant and emotionally abusive"". She believed that the period in which her brother worked with him was ""a type of breaking point"".
	
	
	The period of time that has now elapsed since Stromer became aware of the investigation by ASIC has taken a toll. Dr Allnutt reported:
	


""Overall he said the extended process was devastating because it incurred more legal fees for him and his family, and he understood that as soon as he was charged his career was finished. The legal process that was ongoing continued to demand his time and made it difficult for him to commit to work, it made his social life difficult and overall made his future unpredictable and uncertain. …

He had been with his partner since 2008 and the legal process was a shadow in terms of his mood and the ability for him and his partner to plan for their future. It affected his feelings about himself and his relationship, and created extra stress.""


	
	His partner's testimonial included that, ""Much of our relationship has been dominated by anxieties concerning when and how this matter will be resolved, the pressure on Nathan's family, impact on his reputation, his health, and our future prospects"". She perceived that there had been a negative effect on both his physical and mental health. Similar negative effects resulting from the long and drawn out process of the proceedings are described in the other testimonials. For example, Mr Robert Reiner, a friend since school, observed that Stromer ""has been worn down by the … legal proceedings"" and had endured ""a lot of stress as his life was put under a microscope"" during the protracted investigation. Mr George Papanikitas, a friend from university days, observed that Stromer had experienced a ""very significant personal toll"". Stromer had spoken to him:
	


""about the severe stress that he and his family have experienced over the last 8 years – stemming from his feelings of shame and remorse, the crippling financial burden resulting from incurring very significant legal costs and the loss of his regular income, progressive withdrawal from his social circles, bleak career prospects and uncertainty around sentencing"".

Personal circumstances – Daniel Joffe


	
	Joffe did not give evidence in the sentence proceedings but there were tendered in his case a variety of expert reports, testimonials and other documentary materials.
	
	
	Joffe is aged 38 and lives alone but in the same apartment complex as his parents. He was born in South Africa and came to Australia at the age of 9 after the family had lived for about two years in London.
	
	
	Joffe attained Bachelor of Economics, Bachelor of Laws, and Master of Commerce degrees from the University of New South Wales. He worked as an intern at the Australian Law Reform Commission, as a Research Associate/Financial Analyst for BRW magazine and as a Senior Business Analyst for KordaMentha Corporate Advisory prior to joining Moody’s in late 2005.
	
	
	A useful summary of his life in general may be drawn from the report of Dr Bruce Westmore, psychiatrist:
	


""He describes having had, in the past and currently, a close supportive relationship with his family … and he was also particularly close to his paternal grandfather.

The family moved to the United Kingdom when Mr Joffe was aged 7 and he said, around that time he believes he started to develop various psychological problems … He had trouble making friends and he was teased because of his accent and he had a stutter. He felt his parents' relationship was in jeopardy and he did not feel able or comfortable discussing his own personal problems with them because of that. While in the United Kingdom he felt alone and isolated and he started to develop certain ideas in relation to his body image and he said he felt 'ugly', but he could not understand those emotions at the time or why nobody wanted to be his friend. He started bringing his prepared lunch home from school and he lost his appetite.

A few years later, the family moved to Sydney and his mother's mood improved and his parents' relationship also improved. While he did not feel that the move to Australia was as traumatic as the move to the United Kingdom, he again felt it was 'really challenging'. Isolation and loneliness continued to affect him, although he was able to make some friends and he said of those friendships that he 'cherished them greatly'.

He did well at school and he was a hard worker and no behavioural problems of an antisocial or disciplinary type were identified. He then attended university, where he met the co-accused and a girl who was to become his girlfriend. He describes her as being a somewhat gregarious and outgoing woman and she had many friends and she became 'my lifeline into the world'. He appears to have become quite dependent upon her but, several years into their relationship, she gained the opportunity to work overseas. She took that offer up and he said, around mid-2006 he became aware that she had 'found someone else … it was a terrible blow, I didn't see it coming, I was terribly reliant on her …'.

Following the breakdown of his relationship with his girlfriend, Kara, he became increasingly close to the co-accused in this matter, a man he considered to be his friend and a neighbour. The co-accused appears to have taken over many of the social roles and probably the psychological support type roles that Kara had previously had in his life. It is likely, in my view, that he formed the same dependent type relationship with the co-accused as he had had previously with Kara. The co-accused had disclosed that he was himself having difficulties in his relationship with his own father and Mr Joffe himself discussed and disclosed to the co-accused his own emotional 'hurt and pain' following his breakup with Kara.""


	
	Dr Westmore made the diagnoses of Anorexia Nervosa and Depressive Disorder. He made provisional diagnoses of various forms of the latter. Notwithstanding the seriousness of the offences, he did not detect any antisocial personality characteristics. He did, however, find a causal link between Joffe's mental condition and his offending:
	


""I do believe his quite unique and complex psychopathology did however play an immediate and direct role in the offending behaviour, certainly in his motivation for committing the acts that he did, doing so in the hope that he would assist his friend.""


	
	Professor Kerryn Phelps AM has a medical practice at Double Bay where Joffe had been a patient since 2002. She knew him and his family personally and professionally. She attested to his good character. She also said that she was aware that at the time of the offences he was ""deeply depressed, withdrawn and socially isolated"" and that ""the emotional distress exacerbated a long-standing relapsing eating disorder resulting in weight loss and distorted body image"".
	
	
	Professor Phelps described the effect upon Joffe of the protracted ASIC investigation in terms of it placing ""an inordinate amount of stress on both Daniel and his family"". He consulted her during this period with a range of symptoms including hypertension, insomnia, night terrors, palpitations, shortness of breath, increased severity of migraines, chronic diarrhoea and abdominal pains. She said that after he was charged in January 2010 he became reclusive; he ""did not socialise or leave his unit except to go to the synagogue on Friday evenings or to volunteer for OzHarvest on Tuesday evenings where he assists in feeding the homeless"". She also noted that he had not been able to secure employment and had relied upon his family for financial support which had exacerbated his feelings of guilt, shame, embarrassment and low self-worth. She added, ""This long and protracted ordeal has had a profound effect on Daniel's wellbeing and on the wellbeing of his parents"".
	
	
	Mr Chris Thornton, clinical psychologist, first saw Joffe in relation to his eating disorder in September 2014. The history he obtained included that Joffe had ""experienced a period of relative wellness from 2000 to 2006 whilst in a relationship with a long term girlfriend, Kara"". His weight increased during this period to about 72 kg (he is said to be 174cm tall). But after the relationship ended in 2006 he became depressed and ""slipped into a more serious phase of restricting his eating"". His weight decreased to around 68kg in 3 months. It further decreased from 62 kg in February 2007 to around 60kg in May 2007, up until that time his lowest adult weight. His parents intervened by more closely monitoring his food intake and his weight rose to 65 kg.
	
	
	Mr Thornton said that after Joffe was charged he became obsessed around organising his defence. He experienced significant symptoms of depression and felt compelled to control his weight and eating. To counteract the effects of his parents’ monitoring his eating he increased the intensity of his exercise to control his weight which fluctuated between 60 and 65 kg. When he saw Mr Thornton last year his weight was 66.5 kg. He continued to see him at regular intervals and Mr Thornton observed that, after an initial small increase in Joffe’s weight, by March this year it had dropped to 62 kg. Mr Thornton was sufficiently concerned at the deterioration in his mental health, particularly his anorexia nervosa condition, that he had suggested to Joffe’s general practitioner and psychiatrist that consideration should be given to hospitalisation in a specialised eating disorders inpatient unit to arrest the decline. Mr Thornton also expressed serious concern for Joffe's well-being if he were to be incarcerated, fearing that his eating disorder is likely to worsen significantly.
	
	
	Dr Geoffrey Buckett, a consultant psychiatrist and specialist in the treatment of eating disorders, saw Joffe regularly since September 2014. His diagnoses were consistent with those made by Dr Westmore. He also expressed concern about the ""severe consequences"" of incarceration: ""It is possible that the outcome would be life threatening"".
	
	
	Dr Westmore was similarly concerned:
	


""Clearly incarceration will be extremely difficult for this man because of his multiplicity of psychological and psychiatric problems, but also because of the absence of antisocial characteristics, he will be a prisoner at risk.""


	
	In oral evidence he said that incarceration will make Joffe’s depression worse and likely aggravate his anorexic illness. And this would be exacerbated if he was placed on protection, which he considered quite likely.
	
	
	In a further report (26.4.15), Dr Westmore pointed out that:
	


""Anorexia nervosa in males is rare but, when it does occur, it is recognised by psychiatrists as being a severe and serious condition with generally a poor prognosis.""


	
	The Crown tendered a body of email correspondence obviously derived from Moody's. These were served the day before the sentence hearing was due to begin on 27 April 2015 and necessitated an adjournment. Generally, the emails were intended to show that in 2006, following the break-up of Joffe's relationship with his girlfriend, Kara, he showed an interest in food and sport and was in an intimate relationship with a female co-worker. Clearly the Crown was challenging the assertions that in 2006 Joffe was depressed and had an eating disorder. If anything, this challenge had the reverse effect. In the end, the Crown conceded that Joffe “probably did” have an eating disorder at the time of the offending. The only issue concerned what impact it had.
	
	
	Dr Westmore reviewed the body of emails and obtained further history from Joffe. He concluded that the emails did not detract from the diagnosis of anorexia nervosa. He also questioned whether there was any expert opinion to the contrary (which there is not).
	
	
	Dr Westmore was required to appear for cross-examination. In his evidence in chief he explained the seriousness of anorexia nervosa in males. He said:
	


“It is a rare condition in males. It is recognised as a far more serious condition in males, with a poorer prognosis, associated with greater chronicity, greater morbidity and greater mortality and greater dysfunction generally. In males the illness will often come on later in life rather than [in] adolescence and it adopts a chronic course.”


	
	Dr Westmore was asked about Joffe’s current appearance compared to when he first saw him last December. He said “he looks cachectic to me today”, which he explained meant he was “very thin, emaciated, with a pallor about him … which is not healthy”. This accords with my own observation.
	
	
	On the question of delay in ultimately being sentenced, Dr Westmore wrote in his recent report:
	


""The delays in sentencing are clearly impacting on Mr Joffe's mental health, his need to see medical experts and no doubt have protracted conversations with his legal advisors are all contributing to his distress, as is the uncertainty of the outcome of the court case. Not knowing the outcome is often more difficult, painful and psychologically distressing than having to deal with an outcome, even though it might be negative or unfavourable. He is clearly underweight, he remains depressed and he must be considered to be an at risk patient. There is significant morbidity and mortality associated with both Anorexia Nervosa and depressive illnesses. He remains under psychiatric care and it is vital that this continue. Admission to an eating disorder unit should also be considered at some stage.""


	
	Mr Thornton also reviewed the emails and reported that he had no reason to change his opinion. He took the opportunity to report:
	


""Anorexia Nervosa has the highest mortality rate of any psychiatric condition, and has a higher rate of death by suicide than in patients suffering from depression. There is clear evidence that eating disorders are highly inheritable conditions. [I interpolate that Joffe's mother suffered from the condition.] In no way should the severity of this condition be minimised. They are not a disorder of choice.

…

I am concerned that the late presentation of these emails from the DPP has necessitated a delay in Mr Joffe's hearing. In the weeks between our sessions on 26/3/15 and 4/5/15, Mr Joffe's weight has decreased to 58.8 kilograms. This is a loss of 3.2 kilograms in three weeks. The Clinical Practice Guidelines for the treatment of anorexia nervosa indicate that a persistent weight loss of a kilogram a week is an indication of the need to hospitalise a patient for medical stability. In the week since the delay to date Mr Joffe has decreased his caloric intake by around 50% and has markedly increased his exercise. I am concerned that the delay necessitated by the presentation of these emails has acted to increase the severity of Mr Joffe's eating disorder and has increased the possibility of significant medical complications arising from his disorder. I would be alarmed if there were any further unnecessary delays to bring this matter to a conclusion. My original conclusion that incarceration of Mr Joffe would place his health at great risk by preventing specialist treatment of this serious and complex mental disorder remains.""


	
	It may be noted that within that extract from Mr Thornton's last report there is reference to Joffe's weight being 58.8 kg as at 4 May 2015. Tendered on the last day of the sentence hearing on 28 May was a letter from Professor Phelps advising that she had weighed him on 27 May. His weight had further decreased to 57.1 kg. In another letter she indicated that in a recent discussion with Dr Buckett the question of hospitalisation was given even more earnest consideration.
	
	
	A large number of testimonials and the evidence given by Joffe’s mother provide support for the history of his eating disorder being longstanding. There is reference to the anxiety and stress that he has endured during the period of the investigation and prosecution. They also speak of his many positive personal attributes, describe his offending behaviour as being out of character, and describe the level of his feelings of guilt, shame and remorse. There are expressions of gratitude for Joffe's ""generous spirit and significant contribution"" since 2007 to the work of OzHarvest in gathering and delivering food to the disadvantaged. He has also provided support to the Chai Foundation charity. A rabbi confirmed Joffe's regular attendance at the synagogue and wrote of his continued efforts at atonement ""in a dignified and sincere manner in accordance with the Jewish custom"".
	


Seriousness of the offences


	
	Speaking generally, insider trading is not a ""victimless"" crime; it is a serious criminal offence. It has the capacity to undermine to a significant extent the integrity and efficacy of markets as well as confidence in the commercial world generally. Persons who receive price sensitive information in relation to securities are expected to conform to exacting standards of honesty. Insider trading has been described as a form of cheating; a form of fraud. (These propositions are derived from cases such as R v Rivkin [2003] NSWSC 447; 198 ALR 400 at [44]; R v McKay [2007] NSWSC 275; 61 ACSR 470 at [60]; R v Doff [2005] NSWCCA 119; 54 ACSR 200 at [56]; Hartman v DPP [2011] NSWCCA 261; 87 ACSR 52 at [94] and R v Hill; R v Kamay [2015] VSC 86 at [46].)
	
	
	There are a number of matters to be considered in assessing the seriousness of the offences committed by Messrs Joffe and Stromer. One aspect is the quality or ""grade"" of the inside information. In assessing this it is appropriate to keep in mind that the essential aspect of ""inside information"" is that if it was generally available, it might have a material effect on the price or value of the financial product in question.
	
	
	A high degree of materiality would generally lead to a finding of greater objective seriousness; a low degree of materiality might, but not necessarily, lead to a finding of low objective seriousness; and knowledge by the offender of the degree of materiality would bear upon moral culpability.
	
	
	Much was made in submissions of what information was generally available in the marketplace. However, there is no evidence as to what the offenders' knowledge of this was. In other words, there is no claim by either of them that they considered the materiality of the information to be low because of what was already publicly available. They cannot lay claim to a finding of lower moral culpability on this account. (I note what Joffe is said to have claimed to Dr Westmore (report of 9.12.14 at p. 2.9) but do not accept it, given that it conflicts with the agreed facts.)
	
	
	I accept the submissions that were made about the quality of the information in the Auckland Airport matter being less than that in the case of Alinta Infrastructure. The latter concerned a takeover that was actually proposed, albeit there was no indication of price, whereas the former involved one that was being considered as a possibility. A takeover in the latter might not have come as surprise to the market; it was the timing that was the important aspect of the information. In relation to the Wheat Board offence that Joffe asks to be taken into account, the information concerned some announcements that were to be made which, having regard to what was already in the public domain, was of relatively low quality.
	
	
	Both the amount invested and the profits derived are relevant matters to consider. In round figures, in the Auckland Airport matter, Stromer invested $50,000 and achieved a net profit of about $350. In the Wheat Board matter, he invested $23,000 and achieved a net profit of around $1,300. In the Alinta Infrastructure matter, he invested $95,000, with a likely maximum exposure of $180,000. He derived a net gain $182,000. Of course, Stromer is not to be sentenced in respect of the Wheat Board matter.
	
	
	In the case of CFDs, the actual investment required is a small proportion of the underlying security and greater potential profits and losses from price movements in that security may result. Accordingly, the Crown submitted that both the amount deposited in the margin account and the total potential exposure are relevant to an assessment of criminality. In the case of Alinta Infrastructure, Stromer invested $94,757 and was required to deposit a margin requirement equal to 10 per cent of the total exposure. According to the agreed facts, his likely maximum exposure was $179,457.
	
	
	Although Joffe did not make any investment himself and did not stand to make any profit, I have earlier mentioned my acceptance of the Crown's contention that he intended to contribute $30,000 to the amount invested by Stromer in the Alinta Infrastructure matter.
	
	
	In Joffe's case, it was accepted that he had actual knowledge that the information was not generally available and that if it were, a reasonable person would expect it to have a material effect on the price or value of the financial products in question. Further, if common sense and moral values did not tell him, he was well aware that communicating inside information was wrong by the fact that he had been required to read and understand Moody's trading policies and code of business conduct.
	
	
	A matter particularly important in the assessment of the gravity of Joffe's offences is the breach of trust aspect. Further, the fact that he disclosed the information to only one person, who was a friend, does not assist him. As was observed by Bellew J in Khoo v R [2013] NSWCCA 323 at [16], once he had divulged the information he had no control over what happened to it or how it was used.
	
	
	For Stromer, it was contended that he did not actually know, but simply that he ""ought reasonably have known"" that Joffe was providing to him ""inside information"". The Crown contended to the contrary, but it is a matter that requires proof to the criminal standard of beyond reasonable doubt.
	
	
	The bases for Stromer's submissions were that he was not a ""true insider""; the psychological evidence suggested that he was not in a position to evaluate the information in a clear frame of mind; his conduct, at least in relation to Alinta Infrastructure where there was no attempt to deflect attention, was more consistent with a lack of actual knowledge; and there was other information in the market place, the existence of which made it less likely that he appreciated the information was ""inside"" information. The problem with the latter submission is that there is no evidence of his awareness of what was, or was not, in the market place.
	
	
	The Crown countered by submitting that the fact Stromer was not a true insider was not a basis for inferring a lack of actual knowledge. He was an intelligent man with university degrees in law and commerce, the latter majoring in banking and finance. He had worked for about two years in a major corporate law firm. The information came from his close friend who worked in Moody's core business of providing advice as to the likely credit rating outcome of its clients' proposed corporate activities. It was common sense that any information Joffe received in that role must have been received on a confidential basis; and Stromer must have realised that when the information was conveyed to him. But, as was pointed out in the submissions of Mr Dhanji SC, realising that information was “confidential” is one thing; knowing that it is “inside information” is not necessarily the same.
	
	
	In relation to Auckland Airport, it was an agreed fact that the information conveyed by Joffe to Stromer was that Babcock and Brown was considering making a takeover bid. The nature of the information is such that make it unlikely that Stromer would not have realised that this was ""inside information"".
	
	
	In relation to Alinta Infrastructure, strong indications that Stromer was aware that he was in possession of ""inside information"" were that it concerned an actual rather than possible takeover; his haste in acquiring as much of the financial product as he could; and the fact that he was prepared to risk exposure to a potential loss of about $179,457.
	
	
	I am not prepared to accept that it is a reasonable possibility that Stromer's psychological condition rendered him incapable of evaluating information in a clear frame of mind, or of making reasoned judgments. Having regard to all of the circumstances, I am satisfied that he had actual knowledge in respect of both offences that what he had was “inside information” and not merely confidential information that he ought reasonably have known was of that character.
	
	
	The circumstances in which offences of this nature can be committed vary widely and there are a number of matters to be considered in an assessment of their objective seriousness. A factor that might be significant in one case in this assessment might not be so significant in another. In the end, having considered the types of matters I have just been alluding to, I consider that the Auckland Airport offences are less serious than the Alinta Infrastructure offences. They are not offences that are anywhere near the upper range of seriousness for these types of matters; the Auckland Airport offences are below the midrange of seriousness and the Alinta Infrastructure offences are just within that range. Joffe's offences are more serious than Stromer's because of the breach of trust factor.
	


Some specific findings


	
	There are a number of mitigating factors to be taken into account and most of them are common to each offender.
	
	
	Aside from their offending behaviour, they are persons of good character (which is not uncommon in a matter such as this). Notwithstanding that they did not give evidence, there is an overwhelming body of evidence that supports the proposition that they are genuinely remorseful. There is no realistic prospect of their re-offending (which the Crown conceded) and so personal deterrence is unnecessary to factor into the assessment of sentence.
	
	
	The pleas of guilty are a reflection, in part, of their willingness to facilitate the course of justice. They were entered after protracted challenges to aspects of the prosecution case. The history of the proceedings is so complex and lengthy that it would be impractical, and in any event unproductive, to set out the detail. The flavour of the history may be derived by reference to the following: DSJ v R; NS v R [2012] NSWCCA 9; Joffe v R; Stromer v R [2012] NSWCCA 277; Joffe v The Queen; Stromer v The Queen [2013] HCATrans 109; DSJ v R; NS v R [2014] NSWCCA 77. A significant point to note is that the offenders were originally charged with 10 offences but the prosecution ultimately accepted pleas of guilty to merely 2 of them with Joffe asking that a third offence be taken into account.
	
	
	The delay in the investigation (3 years) and in the proceedings themselves (5½ years) is a significant feature to be taken into account. I acknowledge the submission by senior counsel for the Crown that delay, in and of itself, is not a mitigating feature. And the Crown conceded that ""there has been demonstrated rehabilitation"" during the period of the delay. In this case, responsibility for the delay is not exclusive to one party but it would be a fruitless exercise to trawl through the history in order to assess blame. The fact is that the delay has involved a form of punishment in itself in the adverse psychological impacts that it has had upon each of the offenders.
	
	
	Joffe has not been employed for quite some years. Stromer had only managed to find work in recent years as a call centre salesperson. They are unlikely to find employment in the commercial or legal world for the foreseeable future.
	
	
	Another mitigating feature to be taken into account in Stromer's case is that he co-operated in the making of a pecuniary penalty order under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (Cth) in the sum of $222,349.87: see s 320(a) of that Act.
	
	
	I am not prepared to accept that Stromer's mental condition was at the time of offending or now is of sufficient severity that it should be taken into account in the various ways that are usefully summarised in the judgment of McClellan CJ at CL in Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194; 79 NSWLR 1 at [177]. It remains, however, a significant feature of his overall subjective case and has additional relevance in the assessment of the degree of mitigation to be afforded on account of the inordinate delay in the investigation and prosecution.
	
	
	I am prepared to accept that Joffe's mental condition is relevant. To some extent it was causally linked to his offending which reduces his moral culpability and the need for denunciation of his conduct. I also accept the powerful evidence that his condition of anorexia nervosa would render any custodial sentence more onerous. His mental condition is also relevant in assessing the weight to be given to delay as a mitigating feature.
	


Other matters relevant to the assessment of sentence


	
	It is common ground that no sentence other than one of imprisonment is appropriate in the case of each offender. The seriousness of the offences justifies that position which I accept: s 17A Crimes Act 1914 (Cth).
	
	
	Each offender is to be sentenced for two distinct offences, albeit of a similar nature but separated in time by some months. It is necessary that their sentences be partially accumulated to appropriately reflect the totality of criminality. The Alinta Infrastructure offence is more serious than the Auckland Airport offence and the individual sentences will reflect that.
	
	
	In terms of parity, I have determined that the sentences to be imposed upon each offender should be similar. There are some factors which render Joffe's offences more serious (for example, his breach of trust) but his moral culpability is reduced and he has a more significant subjective case. His overall sentence will be longer than Stromer’s because of the additional offence to be taken into account.
	
	
	The maximum penalty of imprisonment for 5 years and/or a fine of $220,000 is a benchmark I have borne in mind. Similarly, I have had regard to the statutory requirement in s 16A(1) of the Crimes Act to impose a sentence that is of a severity appropriate in all of the circumstances. I have also borne in mind the importance of general deterrence given the difficulty of detecting crimes of this nature, but its significance is tempered in this case to a minor extent in Stromer's case and a little more so in Joffe's case on account of their mental health issues.
	
	
	The ultimate submission for the Crown was that nothing less than a full-time custodial sentence was called for. Senior counsel for each of the offenders submitted that imprisonment was appropriate but that it should either be suspended or served by way of an intensive correction order.
	
	
	I was provided by the Crown and counsel for Joffe with quite informative schedules of other cases of insider trading. I do not intend to describe in detail any particular case but simply confirm that after arriving at a provisional view as to the appropriate sentence the schedules were then reviewed as a yardstick: see Hili v The Queen; Jones v The Queen [2010] HCA 45; 242 CLR 520 at [54]. They confirmed the correctness of my provisional view.

	GLEESON JA:  I agree with Garling J.
	
	
	JOHNSON J: I agree with Garling J
	
	
	GARLING J: This is an application for leave to appeal in respect of a sentence imposed in the District Court of NSW by his Honour, Acting Judge Phegan on 30 May 2014.
	
	
	The applicant, Shawn Jason Cappis, pleaded guilty before Phegan ADCJ to a single offence contrary to ss 11.1 and 307.6(1) of the Criminal Code 1995 (Cth), namely that:
	


“Between 15 March 2013 and 27 July 2013, at Sydney, in the State of NSW, [he] attempted to possess a substance, the substance having been unlawfully imported and the substance being a border controlled drug, namely, methamphetamine, and the quantity possessed being a marketable quantity.”


	
	This offence involved 679.7gms of pure methamphetamine.
	
	
	The offence carries a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment, and/or in addition a fine of $850,000.
	
	
	Phegan ADCJ imposed a sentence of 6 years and 9 months imprisonment commencing on 27 July 2013 with a non-parole period of 4 years commencing on that day, and expiring on 26 July 2017.
	


Facts


	
	The following summary of facts is taken from the Agreed Statement of Facts tendered to the sentencing Judge, and from his Honour’s summary.
	
	
	The applicant was friendly with a Canadian male, Mr Danny Quart. They shared a room at the Falcon Lodge in North Sydney. At the same time as the applicant and Mr Quart were resident at the Falcon Lodge, two Icelandic nationals were also resident there. The four became friendly.
	
	
	On 11 June 2013, the applicant ceased residence at the Falcon Lodge, as did Mr Quart. Mr Quart returned to Canada from Australia shortly afterwards. On 18 July 2013, the applicant transferred money to Mr Quart in Canada.
	
	
	On 22 July 2013, the applicant, who had travelled to Queensland, telephoned the manager of the Falcon Lodge, enquiring as to whether a package had arrived for “his buddy”, a reference to Mr Quart. He asked the manager to contact him on a mobile telephone number when the package arrived.
	
	
	On the following day, a package on consignment from Canada addressed to Mr Quart at Falcon Lodge, was received at Falcon Lodge. The applicant telephoned the manager and asked him if the package had arrived and, because he was in Brisbane, asked the manager to give the package to his two Icelandic friends.
	
	
	The AFP intercepted the package, forensically examined it, and established that there were four brown-coloured bottles inside containing liquid consisting of between 30% and 37% of pure methamphetamine. The forensic analysis established that the total amount of pure methamphetamine secreted inside the four brown-coloured bottles was 679.7gms.
	
	
	Later on 23 July 2013, the applicant contacted his Icelandic friends and asked them to collect the package for him. He told them that the package contained clothes. That was clearly untrue to his knowledge.
	
	
	There was some difficulty in locating the package at the Falcon Lodge, because the AFP had possession of it. The package was replaced, and on the next day, 24 July 2013, the applicant telephoned the manager at the Falcon Lodge to ascertain whether the package had been located. He was told that it had been. He told the manager that his Icelandic friends would return to collect the package. The applicant then sent them a text message asking them to return to the Falcon Lodge to collect the package.
	
	
	Late in the evening of 26 July 2013, the applicant flew from Brisbane to Sydney. He travelled to the Kings Cross area.
	
	
	On the following day, 27 July 2013, the applicant telephoned a male, Mr Jong Hyon Kim (whom the applicant referred to as “Jack”). He made arrangements to meet Mr Kim in a specified location in Chinatown.
	
	
	On the afternoon of 27 July 2013, the applicant travelled by taxi to the Falcon Lodge and met with his Icelandic friends. He retrieved the package from them. After about 30 minutes the applicant left the premises at North Sydney and travelled to Chinatown where he met Mr Kim. He handed a plastic shopping bag to Mr Kim containing the contents of the package which had been sent from Canada to the Falcon Lodge.
	
	
	The applicant and Mr Kim parted ways, and shortly thereafter the applicant was arrested.
	
	
	Mr Kim was followed and observed, and about an hour after the applicant was arrested, Mr Kim was also arrested. The plastic shopping bag handed to him by the applicant was recovered. Inside the plastic shopping bag were the four brown-glass bottles matching the bottles which had been received at Falcon Lodge.
	
	
	About a month later, one of the two Icelandic friends was arrested and charged.
	


Sentence Proceedings in the District Court


	
	In the proceedings on sentence which took place on 29 May 2014, the Crown tendered an Agreed Statement of Facts. The Crown informed the Court that the applicant did not have any previous criminal history.
	
	
	The applicant’s counsel tendered a psychological report of Ms Anna Robilliard. No other evidence was put before the Court.
	
	
	The Crown handed up written submissions on sentence, and provided a schedule of cases which, the Crown submitted, were comparable.
	
	
	The applicant’s counsel made submissions orally. As well, the applicant’s counsel handed up to the Court a two page document containing a table of other cases, and sentences which had been imposed.
	
	
	The report of Ms Robilliard was not subject to any cross-examination by the prosecutor. The report recorded that the applicant was born in Calgary and was aged 34 at the time of his offence. He came from a family of three children. He was the youngest. After an initial period of time of living with his father and mother, their marriage broke down and his mother, together with all of her children, moved across Canada to a different province. There, the applicant’s mother remarried. He seems to have had a reasonably stable family life thereafter. However, he had some difficulty at school where it appears that he had violent tendencies and a quick temper. The applicant reported to Ms Robilliard that this tendency to violence had generally ceased by about his mid-20s.
	
	
	Having left school, he engaged in a range of casual employment. At the age of 21 he moved to Japan and remained there for two and a half years. He found employment in Japan teaching English. He thereafter returned to Canada where he was in only part-time employment.
	
	
	The applicant had a number of personal relationships. He reported that he had no particular difficulties with his health other than the fact that since about the age of 20 he had been treated for an anxiety disorder for which he was taking medication. He reported that whilst in custody, he had occasionally had panic attacks.
	
	
	According to Ms Robilliard’s report, the applicant reported that he had been using drugs and alcohol since his mid-teens. In particular, from the age of about 19 onwards, he had been accustomed to using cocaine.
	
	
	He reported to Ms Robilliard that he had arrived in Australia from Canada in March 2013, and had planned to stay in Australia for about six months. He reported that he had been a heavy user of cocaine whilst in Australia.
	
	
	Ultimately, Ms Robilliard summarised the applicant’s position in this way:
	


“Since his arrest and imprisonment, he said he has been able to look back and recognise that his pattern of substance use had escalated out of his control and in recent years he was involved in a sub-culture that shared his lifestyle which enabled him to deny the seriousness of his addictions. This is no longer the case, and Mr Cappis said that he now realises his addictions have directly contributed his criminal involvement and the current legal situation. He described participating in the index offences as the worst mistake of his life. He maintained that he has since made a decision never to use illegal drugs again and minimise his use of alcohol.”


	
	The applicant informed Ms Robilliard that he intended to return to Canada on his release from custody, initially to stay with his family.
	
	
	Ms Robilliard thought that the applicant would benefit from individual psychotherapy sessions, training courses that would increase his vocational skills and knowledge, and also monitoring and management of his psychoactive medications both whilst in custody and after his release.
	
	
	During the sentencing proceedings, the Crown submitted that the applicant performed the role of the principal recipient of the drugs in Australia and that, although there was no specific evidence to suggest that the applicant was to receive any financial reward for his role in the offence, a common sense inference was that the applicant was involved for profit.
	
	
	The Crown noted in submissions that the quantity of drugs was significantly above the minimum marketable quantity, and that general deterrence was fundamental consideration in the assessment of the appropriate sentence.
	
	
	Counsel for the applicant did not demur from the descriptions of the applicant’s involvement in the offence. She conceded that her client “did not appear to be at the bottom of the chain”, but that he fell somewhere in the middle because he was not the principal of the offence.
	
	
	The Crown’s submissions noted that the Court should take into account the applicant’s plea of guilty. The Crown conceded that the applicant had entered a plea of guilty at the first reasonable opportunity. However it added this submission:
	


“However, given the strength of the Crown case, the Crown submits that the Court could not be satisfied that the offender’s plea was more than recognition of the inevitable.”


	
	The Crown submitted that the strength of the Crown case may be taken into account and that by reference to a number of authorities, the Court was entitled to consider whether the applicant’s plea was motivated by a willingness to facilitate the course of justice, or simply a “recognition of the inevitable”.
	
	
	The Crown noted, with respect to sentencing for Commonwealth offences, that it was reasonable to adopt a range of discounts of between 10% and 25%. The Crown also noted in its submissions that it was not necessary for a court to specify the quantity of the discount to which regard had been had.
	
	
	On the issue of a discount for the early plea of guilty, the only submission made by counsel for the applicant was that the Court would:
	


“… allow for the plea of guilty, for the plea at the earliest opportunity, that being in the Local Court”.


	
	Counsel for the applicant then addressed his Honour with respect to a series of specific cases. At the end of that address, she said:
	


“But your Honour, my ultimate submission to you … would be that the Court may consider that a head sentence somewhere between 5 and 7 years is appropriate in this case.”


	
	Counsel for the applicant had previously submitted, having regard to the fact that the applicant was facing his first full-time period of custody, and that he would be returning to Canada upon the completion of any minimum term, that:
	


“I would ask the Court to consider imposing a minimum term of around the 60-65% mark.”

Remarks on Sentence


	
	Phegan ADCJ proceeded to sentence the applicant on 30 May 2014, which was the day following the submissions which had been made.
	
	
	His Honour summarised the Agreed Statement of Facts. He summarised the effect of the report of Ms Robilliard. He then addressed the specific provisions of s 16A of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth). He also noted that it was important to include as a relevant factor, the concept of general deterrence in any of his statements.
	
	
	The sentencing Judge concluded with respect to the role of the applicant in the offence, that he was not a mere courier, and that he had a role in the importation of the drug which was significant. His Honour said:
	


“He clearly was an active participant and very much part of the putting in place with the arrangements which brought about the importation of the drug and indeed, even beyond that, the somewhat clandestine arrangement for its collection and its further distribution through Mr Kim.”


	
	His Honour concluded that the applicant was at a level of “some significance” in the course of the importation.
	
	
	His Honour moved on to note the quantity which he found was significantly in excess of the minimum marketable quantity of drugs.
	
	
	His Honour then turned to the subjective factors of the applicant’s personal history, and summarised them. He noted in particular that the applicant had no prior criminal record in Australia.
	
	
	His Honour then considered the question of the early guilty plea. He had regard to the fact that the plea occurred at the earliest reasonably practicable opportunity, and also that the case against the applicant was very strong and that a conviction, his Honour found, was almost inevitable. His Honour then said:
	


“In the circumstances therefore, I regard a reduction of what might otherwise have been the appropriate sentence, by something in the vicinity of, or slightly in excess of, 15% to be appropriate.”


	
	Having addressed all of those matters, his Honour then imposed the sentence to which earlier reference has been made.
	
	
	It is convenient to note at this point that the sentence (6 years 9 months) fell within, but towards, the upper end of the range (5 years to 7 years) which counsel for the applicant had submitted was the appropriate head sentence. The non-parole period was about 60% of the overall sentence. This was the most favourable percentage to the applicant urged upon the Court by the applicant’s counsel (60% to 65%).
	
	
	The sentence was dated to commence from 27 July 2013, which was the date upon which the applicant was taken into custody.
	


Application for Leave to Appeal


	
	On 2 February 2015, the applicant lodged a Notice of Application for leave to appeal against his sentence.
	
	
	The grounds of appeal drafted by the applicant himself were as follows:
	


“1.   Not granted my full 25% discount for my early guilty plea.

2.   Bad legal advice.

3.   Judge’s comments.

4.   Discount for compassionate grounds.”

Ground 1: Inadequate Discount for Plea of Guilty


	
	The applicant’s written and oral submissions were concise. He submitted that he entered a plea of guilty at the earliest point in time. He submits that he had been advised by his lawyer that he would be given a full 25% discount, that he feels that the 25% discount was “an entitlement”, and that it was an error on the part of the Judge to fail to give him a 25% discount, to represent his early plea of guilty. He drew the Court’s attention to many cases where a discount of 25% had been allowed for an early plea.
	
	
	It cannot be doubted that a significant consideration with respect to the appropriate allowance by way of a discount to an offender who pleads guilty, is whether the plea was entered at the first reasonable opportunity. Here, that was conceded by the Crown, and recognised by the sentencing Judge.
	
	
	The central matter which is required to be considered by the sentencing Judge is the willingness of the offender to facilitate the course of justice by entering the plea. In assessing that willingness, when a sentencing court is dealing with a Commonwealth offence, a relevant consideration for the sentencing Court is the strength of the Crown case against the offender: see Tyler v R; R v Chalmers [2007] NSWCCA 247 at [114] per Simpson J, 173 A Crim R 458; Danial v R [2008] NSWCCA 15 at [28] per James J.
	
	
	Clearly, there was a strong Crown case against the applicant. As the facts and matters discussed below in [74] and [75] show, a conviction was inevitable. There was no error in the sentencing Judge fixing a discount by having regard to such features.
	
	
	In that respect, it cannot be said that the choice of the figure of 15% for the discount was an inappropriate one.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that he had an entitlement to a discount of 25%.
	
	
	A similar submission was made, and rejected, by this Court in Trujillo-Mesa v R [2010] NSWCCA 201. Fullerton J (with whom Hodgson JA and Price J agreed) said at [17] this:
	


“This Court has restated in a number of decisions, and without qualification, that there is no entitlement to and no presumption favouring a particular percentile discount for a plea of guilty.”


	
	The applicant’s submission that he had an entitlement to a discount of 25% is simply wrong and must be rejected.
	
	
	I would reject the first ground.
	


Ground 2: Bad Legal Advice


	
	The applicant submits that his lawyer informed him that he would be given a full 25% discount for his plea of guilty. The applicant asserts that the lawyer “promised” this to him. He says that the lawyer reassured him that he would receive such a discount.
	
	
	He then submitted:
	


“When judge said only granted 15%, I urged lawyer to fight. She said don’t fight in front of this judge ‘we will appeal’. ”


	
	There is no evidence before the Court as to what the legal advice actually given to the applicant was. The applicant does not suggest in his written submissions that, had he been given different advice, he would not have entered a plea of guilty. There is no application to withdraw his plea of guilty.
	
	
	The proposition that the advice that he received was bad advice depends upon the fact that he was confident that he would receive a 25% discount. For the reasons which I have expressed in dealing with the first ground of appeal, no offender has an entitlement to any particular discount, there is no fixed percentage discount which is applicable in all circumstances, and the application of the discount is a matter entirely for a sentencing Judge.
	
	
	It can be accepted that the applicant’s lawyer may have anticipated a higher discount than 15%, and may have said that to the applicant. However, any such advice is always, in respect of any discretionary consideration in the sentencing process, a matter which is ultimately for the decision of a Judge, and a matter upon which no offender can expect to be given any firm assurance.
	
	
	The applicant complains that his lawyer did not fight the judge when a 15% discount was announced. However, in the course of submissions, no percentage discount was discussed either by the Crown during its submissions or during oral submissions of counsel for the applicant. In the course of discussion during submissions, no percentage discount was raised or discussed. The only time the sentencing Judge announced the discount, was in the course of his Remarks on Sentence. It was at that stage, clearly inappropriate for counsel for the applicant to have said anything at all.
	
	
	This ground of appeal must, in my view, be rejected.
	


Ground 3: Judge’s Comments


	
	The applicant submits that, in effect, the conclusion of the sentencing Judge that, upon the facts, a conviction for his offence was inevitable, was not one that could properly be reached or determined at all.
	
	
	The applicant’s written submissions say that he is not sure how anyone can determine what he would or would not do in any case. He points to the fact his case was dealt with promptly, expeditiously and efficiently with concomitant savings of costs.
	
	
	In my view, this ground has no merit and ought be dismissed.
	
	
	On the facts placed before the sentencing Judge, the evidence gathered by the Crown was overwhelming. The friendship between the applicant and Mr Quart, the transfer of money by the applicant to Mr Quart followed shortly thereafter by the receipt of a package at the residential address of the applicant, which Mr Quart had left, and the enquiries made by the applicant of the manager of the premises to identify the arrival of the package, all provide compelling evidence that the applicant knew that the package was being imported.
	
	
	The recorded discussions between the applicant and his Icelandic friends when the package was being unwrapped, his arrangements with Mr Kim to deliver the package to him and hand over the contents of it, and his actions in taking the contents of the package from Falcon Lodge to Chinatown and handing them over to Mr Kim, which were observed and available to be proved by independent, reliable and corroborated evidence, all demonstrate that this applicant knew that it was a package containing illicit drugs, and was keen to obtain possession of it. The Crown case was compelling.
	
	
	The conclusion of the sentencing Judge was well open to him. There is no error of fact. The applicant’s submissions must be rejected.
	


Ground 4: Compassionate Grounds


	
	The applicant submits that he ought to have been given a further 5% discount on his sentence because he was a foreigner, and that his time in prison would be difficult. He submitted that he has no family or friends to visit him whilst he is in prison. He apparently receives no visits and, because he is a foreigner, he is not able to access work release or weekend leave. He submits that it is hard being away from home, family and friends and in prison.
	
	
	This Court has said on many occasions that these matters are of strictly limited significance.
	
	
	In R v Ferrer-Esis (1991) 55 A Crim R 231, Hunt J (with whom Gleeson CJ and Lee CJ at CL agreed) said at 239:
	


“There were a number of subjective facts which the Judge took into account. The respondent is incarcerated in a foreign country, living amidst a foreign language and a foreign culture. He is isolated from any outside contact. However, with all due respect to the views to the contrary, which may have been expressed by others, I do not consider that very much weight should be given to that particular circumstance.

The fact is that any person who comes to this country specifically and quite deliberately to commit a serious crime here (as did the respondent) has not justifiable cause for complaint when, as the inevitable consequence of the discovery of his crime, he is obliged to remain incarcerated in this country, with its language and culture foreign to him, isolated from outside contact. …”


	
	There is no reason why the fact that any foreigner, present in Australia, as a temporary visitor, who chooses to commit a crime in the deliberate way in which this applicant has, ought expect that such hardship as inevitably follows from being isolated from and friends, ought carry any significant weight.
	
	
	The applicant’s submissions suggest an entitlement to a further 5% discount to reflect this factor. There is no such entitlement. His isolation from family and friends is a factor to be considered, but one which is of very limited significance.
	
	
	Here, on the particular facts of this case, it was a matter which carried very little, if any, weight in the sentencing process. I detect no error on the part of the sentencing Judge with respect to this aspect.
	
	
	This ground fails.
	


Conclusion


	
	No error has been shown with respect to any of the grounds advanced on the appeal.
	
	
	There was no ground which raised any suggestion of a manifest excess in the sentence imposed by the sentencing Judge. Having regard to the seriousness of the offence, and the potential maximum penalty, the sentence is one which, on any view, is well within the range available to a sentencing Judge in the exercise of their discretion.
	
	
	Accordingly, I do not hold the opinion that any less severe sentence is warranted in law, and should have been passed.
	
	
	I propose the following orders:
	



	
	Application for leave to appeal granted.
	
	
	Appeal dismissed.

Judgment


	
	THE COURT: This is an application for leave to appeal in respect of a sentence imposed by her Honour Judge Wilson (as she then was) in the District Court of NSW on 8 August 2014.
	
	
	The applicant, Goce (or George) Mitreski, pleaded guilty before Wilson DCJ to six charges, each for an offence against s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985, namely that on various dates between 10 January 2013 and 21 March 2013, he supplied a prohibited drug, namely, methamphetamine. In addition, the applicant admitted to four other charges, three of supplying a prohibited drug, namely, methylamphetamine contrary to s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act; and one of knowingly dealing with the proceeds of crime contrary to s 193B(2) of the Crimes Act 1900.
	
	
	The maximum penalty for his offences against s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act, is 15 years imprisonment and/or a fine of $220,000.
	
	
	Wilson DCJ proceeded to impose an aggregate sentence pursuant to s 53A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. She imposed an overall sentence of 4 years and 4 months imprisonment commencing on 21 March 2013, and expiring on 20 July 2017. She specified a non-parole period of 3 years and 3 months which will expire on 20 June 2016.
	


Application for Leave to Appeal


	
	On 2 April 2015, the applicant filed a Notice of Application for leave to appeal. The application is limited to a single ground, in the following form:
	


“The sentencing judge erred in declining to make a finding of special circumstances.”


	
	It will be appropriate to commence consideration of the application by setting out a brief summary of the facts giving rise to the offences.
	


Facts


	
	This summary of facts is taken from a Statement of Facts tendered to the sentencing Judge, and from her Honour’s Remarks on Sentence. The prosecution case against the applicant was largely based upon electronic surveillance of his telephone, and upon specific events observed on 21 March 2013.
	
	
	Over the course of 10 and 11 December 2012, investigating police intercepted a series of text messages between the offender and another individual, which referred to the applicant being in a position to supply two ounces of methylamphetamine at a purchase price of $2,200. That offence was one of the offences placed on a Form 1 to be taken into account.
	
	
	On 18 December 2012, further exchanges of text messages constituted an agreement by the applicant to supply Mr Edmonds with an ounce of methylamphetamine. This offence was also placed on a Form 1.
	
	
	Over 24 and 25 December 2012, a further agreement to supply methylamphetamine by the applicant to Mr Edmonds was entered into. This involved the supply of one ounce of methylamphetamine. This was the third offence placed on the Form 1 schedule.
	
	
	The offences which were specifically charged, and to which the applicant pleaded guilty, involved four occasions between 10 January 2013 and 2 March 2013, when the applicant agreed to supply one ounce of methylamphetamine to Mr Edmonds.
	
	
	On 21 March 2013, investigating police monitored a meeting between Jason Edmonds and the applicant. The pair were followed to a fast food restaurant carpark at Edgeworth and were observed to park in adjacent spaces within that carpark. When the applicant arrived, Mr Edmonds was seen to get out of his car and walk towards the applicant’s car. The police stopped the applicant and Mr Edmonds and arrested them.
	
	
	Upon searching the applicant, police found a small resealable bag containing 27.4gms of methylamphetamine, the purity of which was 13.5%. The possession of this drug constituted the fifth offence with which the applicant was charged.
	
	
	After the search was concluded, the applicant was asked about whether he had any further drugs in his possession. He informed police that there were drugs in his motor vehicle.
	
	
	The police found a small Tupperware container in the car which contained 53.2gms of methylamphetamine with a purity of 12.5%. As well inside the container was a separate medium sized resealable plastic bag which was found to contain 29.6gms of methylamphetamine with a purity of 13.5%.
	
	
	The applicant, when questioned, admitted that the drugs found on his person in the carpark were for supply to Mr Edmonds, and that the drugs found in the motor car were for the purpose of supplying other individuals. The possession of these drugs constituted the sixth drug supply offence with which the applicant was charged.
	
	
	The final offence which was placed on a Form 1, was an offence of dealing in the proceeds of crime. After his arrest, police executed a search warrant at the applicant’s home at Argenton. A sum of $14,050 was found. This sum of money formed the basis of the charge which was taken into account on a Form 1.
	
	
	Wilson DCJ expressed these conclusions with respect to the facts:
	


“The charged offences – [including] the Form 1 offences – represent the supply of over 330gms of methylamphetamine with an approximate value … of around $1,000 … per 28gms. The motivation for the offender’s crimes was financial, and the $14,050 or so in his possession at arrest, is some small indication of the scale of the trade in which he was involved….

Plainly, over the period of three or fourth months encompassed by the charges, the offender was a supplier of reasonably significant amounts of methylamphetamine to those able to pay the purchase price for his product. He had a customer base and understood language by which drugs and payment could be discussed discretely, and a price structure and payment systems for the transactions in which he was involved. Significant amounts of money changed hands to the offender’s profit.

The conclusion that the offender was trafficking in methylamphetamine is inescapable …

…

The offender’s crimes … represent a commercial operation of sales for profit to all comers.”

Sentence Proceedings in the District Court


	
	The Crown tendered a Statement of Facts. The Crown informed the Court that the applicant had no previous criminal history. It also tendered a pre‑sentence report.
	
	
	As well, the Crown sought an order for the forfeiture of the money pursuant to the Proceeds of Crimes Act 2002 (Cth). The Crown asked that an issue with respect to the forfeiture of the applicant’s motor vehicle await further proceedings.
	
	
	Counsel for the applicant tendered seven documents which were references about the applicant, either from friends or family, former employers and a short reference from the Parklea Chaplaincy Service. Finally, a letter from the applicant addressed to the Court was tendered. There was no objection to that material and it was admitted. There was no other evidence or material placed before the Court on the question of sentence.
	
	
	The pre-sentence report compiled by the Community Corrections officer at Parklea, set out the background of the applicant. It recorded that the applicant was the eldest of two siblings; that he had a stable and supportive upbringing; and that his parents’ Macedonian culture and beliefs played a strong part in his upbringing, which occasionally led to clashes with his beliefs developed in a more Westernised culture.
	
	
	The Court was told that the applicant continued to share a close relationship with his family and has been the recipient of their ongoing support during his period on remand.
	
	
	The applicant was educated to a Year 12 level, although his education was characterised, and disrupted, by the fact that he was bullied by reason of his different ethnic background from his fellow students.
	
	
	The applicant worked part-time during his time at school and, upon completing school, began full-time employment in a warehouse with a major retail company. He worked there for over 15 years, and was promoted over time to a managerial position. Once he achieved that position, the applicant apparently began experiencing workplace bullying which resulted in him leaving his job, but gaining employment with a well-known machinery company. The applicant’s employment with that company continued up to the time of his arrest, although his position was due to be made redundant about a week later.
	
	
	The applicant reported a history of drinking, and using illicit substances later in life, from about the age of 23 on a regular basis. About a year before his arrest the applicant recorded that he began using amphetamines on a weekly basis. He also reported that he had a gambling problem. The Community Corrections officer assessed the applicant as being at low risk of re-offending.
	
	
	The Community Corrections officer expressed the view that the applicant accepted responsibility for his role in the offences, and was able to demonstrate an appropriate level of insight as to how his actions may impact on the greater community.
	
	
	The officer considered that the applicant would benefit from a period of supervision by Community Corrections, with strategies including referral to appropriate agencies to address gambling issues, a referral to a drug and alcohol service for assessment and referral to a psychological service to address “… unresolved issues with regards to bullying”.
	
	
	The applicant’s letter to the Court included the following statements:
	


“Since my incarceration one year ago, the time in custody I have spent on remand, I have come to realise the error of my ways. I have had a lot of time to reflect and am very remorseful of my actions and seeing how I have hurt my family, hurts me even more.”


	
	The applicant went on to record that he had used his time in custody to undertake courses whenever possible, that he had sought help from the chaplaincy service and had come to recognise that his crimes were associated with his alcohol intake, his recreational drug use, and his gambling addiction.
	
	
	He informed the Court that he proposed to change those things by changing his friends when he was released from custody and making every attempt upon release to live a responsible and better life.
	
	
	The various references testify to the fact that, but for these offences, the applicant was a man of good character who had got along well with his peers, participated in sport and had been a good employee.
	
	
	The reference from the chaplaincy service referred to a note with respect to Mr Mitreski’s participation in the Positive Lifestyle Program:
	


“Goce has been one of the most encouraging participants I have encountered in this course over the past few years. We have talked about how he draws on past problems and past successes in planning for the future. His ability to think out of the square in organisation at work, something he was very proud of, and we talked about he needs to use those skills in other settings, especially in close relationships. He has a realistic grasp of future planning and is acknowledging he will have to contend with significant ‘ex inmate’ hurdles as normal life problems.”


	
	One of the employment references was of importance. It came from an international freight forwarder and licensed customs broker. It says:
	


“George Mitreski is a person who is held in high regard within our organisation. Management at Megatop Cargo are aware of George’s attributes and have offered a position within the company in the past as a warehouse manager. George is both very bright and quite motivated. I am confident that he will devote himself to a position within our organisation with a high degree of diligence.

Mr Mitreski would be an asset at Megatop Cargo as he is highly motivated and skilled in the role we are looking to fulfil within our warehouse staff ranks.

I recommend George without reservation. I am confident that he will establish productive relationships with the staff at Megatop and our constituents.”


	
	Whilst this is a relevant and most supportive statement, it is regrettable that the author of it does not acknowledge that she has been provided with any information at all, or that the company has been provided with any specific information about the nature of the offences, and the underlying conduct, in which the applicant had been engaged. Necessarily, this limits the weight which can be given by the sentencing Judge to the author’s opinion.
	


Remarks on Sentence


	
	Her Honour’s Remarks on Sentence commenced with a careful attention to the facts of the applicant’s offending. Her Honour also noted that the applicant had entered pleas in the Local Court prior to committal, which warranted a discount of 25% on any sentence.
	
	
	Her Honour made positive findings in her Remarks on Sentence with respect to the applicant. Those positive findings included:
	



	
	the applicant was a man aged 34 years old without any prior criminal history, of previous good character who was well supported by his close family;
	
	
	the applicant had a good level of education, and a good working ethic, and a good long term work history, seemingly continuously employed after leaving school;
	
	
	the applicant’s work history was such that he had a number of employment opportunities open to him upon release from custody;
	
	
	the applicant became involved in the drug trade as a means of obtaining funds to gamble and pay his gambling debts;
	
	
	the applicant had good prospects of rehabilitation, his future prospects were bright;
	
	
	the applicant was remorseful for his crimes and had some insight into the damage that drug traffickers inflicted on others;
	
	
	the applicant had made the most of his time in custody seeking out courses and activities that could assist him to address his gambling addiction and substance abuse; he had sought counselling and spiritual support from chaplains and was regarded as a model prisoner who worked hard and well.
	



	
	Her Honour then noted that a submission had been made on behalf of the applicant that the Court should find special circumstances. With respect to that submission, her Honour said:
	


“Special circumstances seem to have become, in practical application, anything but special. Here, the offender has addressed his gambling addiction to the extent that he can in custody, and sought assistance for his drug use issues. It seems to me that there is no real need for any extended period of parole and, accordingly, I do not make that finding.”


	
	Her Honour then addressed the fact that in cases involving trafficking of drugs, general deterrence needed to be a substantial element of any sentence which was imposed. Her Honour had also earlier addressed the question of weight to be given to the applicant’s prior good character and lack of criminal history. She observed, in accordance with authorities cited, that in cases of deliberate and planned criminality, particularly with drug trafficking, the features of good character and lack of prior criminal history would have less significance and weight in considering the appropriate sentence to be imposed. Her Honour also noted that having regard to the fact that the criminality in question was a course of conduct over a period of some months “… his former good character has to be of diminishing relevance in any event”.
	
	
	Her Honour then summarised the position with these remarks:
	


“The offender’s crimes represent an ongoing course of criminality which can, subject to the principle of totality, be appropriately reflected by an aggregate sentence. There should, in my view, be some degree of accumulation since the magnitude of the overall criminality cannot adequately be comprehended by the sentence imposed for one individual offence.”


	
	Her Honour then proceeded to impose the aggregate sentence, which consisted of an overall sentence of 4 years and 4 months, with a non-parole period of 3 years and 3 months.
	


Applicant’s Submissions


	
	As earlier indicated, the applicant relies on a single ground of error on the part of the sentencing Judge, namely, her failure to make a finding of special circumstances.
	
	
	The content of her Honour’s Remarks on Sentence which specifically addresses the issue of special circumstances is set out above at [38].
	
	
	The applicant submitted that her Honour’s conclusion that there was “no real need for any extended period of parole” was the principal reason for her conclusion that special circumstances did not exist. The applicant submitted that this was an erroneously narrow conclusion because the principle referred to by some authorities reflected both the need for an extended period of release on parole and, as well, the desirability of an extended period of release on parole to facilitate the rehabilitation of the offender as constituting special circumstances.
	
	
	The applicant next submitted that, in considering whether there was a “need” for an extended period of parole, the sentencing Judge erroneously focussed attention on what the applicant had done in the past while in custody. The error was submitted to be that what the applicant had done whilst in custody was not directly relevant, the issue being whether he needed an extended period of conditional release in the future, subject to parole, to improve his chances of successfully overcoming his gambling addiction and drug issues.
	
	
	Finally, the applicant submitted that his case was one which raised a clear basis for a finding of special circumstances, namely, that the finding that he had already made progress towards rehabilitation, and had good prospects of rehabilitation, was directly relevant to the consideration of making a finding of special circumstances, but had not been taken into account by the sentencing Judge.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that in the event that error was established, this Court would engage in a resentencing process which left the head sentence intact, which made a finding of special circumstances, and then determined the appropriate non-parole period.
	


Crown Submissions


	
	The Crown submitted that the ground for the application was misconceived because the sentencing Judge had carefully considered whether or not special circumstances should be found, and had rejected a finding of special circumstances. The Crown noted that this was not a case in which a sentencing Judge had failed to consider whether or not special circumstances existed, nor had failed to provide reasons for not finding the existence of special circumstances.
	
	
	The Crown drew attention to a recent decision of this Court in Estephan v R [2015] NSWCCA 100 which addressed all of the principles involved in a finding of special circumstances.
	
	
	The Crown noted authorities of this Court to the effect that the mere fact that in any one case there were circumstances present which enabled a finding of special circumstances to be made did not compel the Court to make such a finding and thereby reduce the non-parole period. The Crown submitted that the Court would keep in mind that a non-parole period must appropriately reflect the criminality involved in the offence.
	
	
	The Crown finally submitted that there was no error of the necessary kind to allow for this Court to intervene. In particular, the Crown pointed to the fact that the factors relied upon as constituting special circumstances were taken into account as mitigating factors in the determination of the aggregate sentence, and to count them again would run the risk of double counting. The Crown concluded by submitting that:
	


“Her Honour, as she was entitled to be, was unpersuaded by the applicant’s circumstances that there was a sufficiently special basis for a finding of special circumstances on the material before her. The applicant did not discharge his onus of persuading her Honour to find special circumstances, and it would have been an error for counsel to attempt to persuade her by double counting the factors already advanced as [mitigating] circumstances.”

Discernment


	
	It cannot be doubted that a determination by a sentencing Judge to adjust the ratio of the non-parole period to the overall sentence from that prescribed by s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act involves the exercise of making findings of fact, accompanied by an evaluative judgment to determine whether the factual circumstances found justify the lowering of the non-parole period below the statutory ratio: see R v Simpson [2001] NSWCCA 534 at [73]; (2001) 53 NSWLR 704; MD v R [2015] NSWCCA 37 at [40]; Allen v R [2015] NSWCCA 113 at [33].
	
	
	Section 44(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act records that the non-parole period for the sentence is “… the minimum period for which the offender must be kept in detention in relation to the offence”. Spigelman CJ in R v Simpson at [56] noted that this express provision reinforced what the High Court of Australia had said in Power v The Queen [1974] HCA 26; (1974) 131 CLR 623, where, in the joint judgment, at 628 and 629, the Court said:
	


“… In a true sense the non-parole period is a minimum period of imprisonment to be served because the sentencing Judge considers that the crime committed calls for such detention.”


	
	And, further, at 629:
	


“… The legislative intention … [is] to provide for mitigation of the punishment of the prisoner in favour of his rehabilitation through conditional freedom, when appropriate, once the prisoner has served the minimum time that a judge determines justice requires that he must serve, having regard to all of the circumstances of his offence.”


	
	As Spigelman CJ went on to say, at [57] in Simpson:
	


“The reasoning in Power indicates that it is not appropriate to determine the non-parole period primarily from the perspective of the length of the period of supervision on parole. Indeed, the primary perspective should be the length of the minimum period of actual incarceration. By enacting a provision that only works one way – requiring specific justification for a lower proportion but not for a higher proportion – Parliament has, in my opinion, reinforced this as the primary perspective. This has the effect that the scope of the considerations relevant to the determination of ‘special circumstances’, must encompass the full range of issues which are relevant to the determination of the minimum period of actual incarceration without hope of release on parole.”


	
	The nature of the findings underpinning a finding, or rejection of a finding, of special circumstances are such that this Court is slow to intervene: Jiang v R [2010] NSWCCA 277 at [83]; Caristo v R [2011] NSWCCA 7 at [27]; Piscitelli v R [2013] NSWCCA 8 at [54].
	
	
	As submitted by the Crown, the mere presence of circumstances which are capable of constituting special circumstances is not sufficient to compel the Court to make such a finding, thereby reducing the statutory ratio of the non-parole period to the whole sentence: R v Fidow [2004] NSWCCA 172 at [22].
	
	
	It is also appropriate to note that at [59] in Simpson, Spigelman CJ rejected the proposition that the fixing of a non-parole period is a matter that is to be determined solely or primarily by reason of considerations of rehabilitation.
	
	
	The High Court in Muldrock v R [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CLR 120, said at [57]:
	


“In any event, it was an error to determine the structure of the sentence upon a view that the appellant would benefit from treatment while in fulltime custody. Fulltime custody is punitive. The non-parole period is imposed because justice requires that the offender serve that period in custody. Furthermore, the availability of rehabilitative programs within prisons is a matter for executive determination. There can be no confident prediction that an offender will be accepted into a program or that the program will be continued to be offered during the term of the sentence.” (footnotes omitted)


	
	The applicant’s submissions which criticise the sentencing Judge for not addressing both the need and desirability for any extended period of parole, are misplaced. Both are capable of constituting special circumstances: Muldrock at [58]; GN v R [2012] NSWCCA 96 at [14].
	
	
	The phrase “special circumstances” seems to have attracted overly frequent judicial scrutiny. Submissions have sought to have the Court interpret the phrase narrowly, or to restrict what can or ought or must be taken into account. The Court has been asked to endorse statements as to what the “test” is for special circumstances to be established.
	
	
	However, the past authorities of this Court have emphasised the breadth of the phrase “special circumstances”, and have avoided any narrowness of interpretation, and have not adopted any “test” which an offender needs to comply with before the Court can find special circumstances.
	
	
	As Samuels JA said in R v Moffitt (1990) 20 NSWLR 114, at 116 E-F:
	


“In determining whether there are special circumstances … the Court must consider all the relevant circumstances: that is to say … all the factors which the prisoner’s overall situation exhibits and which in combination make the case special and bear upon the suitability of a longer than normal additional term …”


	
	Spigelman CJ said in Simpson at [60] of the words “special circumstances” that they are words of “indeterminate reference”, which appear in a sentencing context and that:
	


“60   Statutory words of such generality usually lead courts to refuse to identify in advance a list of matters capable of satisfying the statutory formulation. While certain considerations might not often be sufficiently ‘special’, so that an exceptional justification is required for them to attain the requisite statutory quality, nevertheless there may always be circumstances in which such a factor is of sufficient strength, either alone or in combination with other factors, to justify a conclusion that ‘special circumstances’ are made out on the facts of a particular case. It will be comparatively rare for an issue to arise in terms of a proposition that a particular circumstance is incapable, as a matter of law, of ever constituting a ‘special circumstance’. ”


	
	The manner in which the sentencing Judge expressed herself did not indicate, as submitted by the applicant, an unduly narrow approach to a finding of special circumstances. The Remarks on Sentence indicated that her Honour had considered, and found, all of the facts which were relevant to the imposition of sentence, including the non-parole period, and which may have been relevant to a finding of special circumstances. It is correct that her Honour expressed one reason for declining to find special circumstances, but that part of her Honour’s remarks cannot be read as demonstrating that she ignored all of the other factors, nor that she ignored the ultimate issue, namely what was the minimum period of imprisonment called for by the offences to which the applicant pleaded guilty.
	
	
	The Court is not persuaded of any error on the part of the sentencing Judge in this respect.
	
	
	The criticism of her Honour for noting that the applicant had addressed his gambling addiction, and had sought assistance for his drug use issues whilst in custody to the extent that he could, is not a valid one. Her Honour was commenting on the past situation. She was reflecting on the facts of which she had been informed by the applicant. Those facts had been corroborated by the pre-sentence report and, in a general sense, by the chaplain’s report.
	
	
	Her Honour was not making, as submitted by the applicant contrary to the authority in Muldrock, a determination based upon the possibility of future treatment whilst in custody. She was merely commenting upon the past. She was indicating that the fact that the applicant had undergone steps towards rehabilitation to the extent which he could, a fact which underlay her Honour’s conclusion that his future prospects of rehabilitation and more generally were good, indicated that he did not need a longer period of parole than that prescribed. There is nothing erroneous about her Honour’s remarks in this respect. They do not display error of the kind alleged.
	
	
	The nub of the complaint by the applicant was that there were many features of the applicant’s subjective case which could have, and would have, justified a finding of special circumstances.
	
	
	However, her Honour reviewed all of these facts, she noted them and took them into account in determining the sentence, both the non-parole period and the balance of term. She declined to find special circumstances. The Court is not persuaded that there has been any error in her Honour’s refusal to make a finding of special circumstances.
	
	
	The general facts and matters are not such as would compel this Court to a conclusion that her Honour’s evaluative judgment was of a kind which permitted this Court to intervene.
	
	
	The appeal should be dismissed.

2703248,R v Lambaditis [2015] NSWSC 746,"REMARKS ON SENTENCE


	
	On 26 September 2014, the offender, Nicholas Lambaditis was charged on indictment that on 3 November 2013 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales he did murder Lucio Rodrigues.
	
	
	The proceedings were listed for trial commencing on 9 March 2015. On that date there was a voir dire hearing, following which the Crown elected not to proceed on the indictment.
	
	
	Accordingly, the offender was charged on indictment on 9 March 2015 that he on 3 November 2013 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales did unlawfully kill Lucio Rodrigues.
	
	
	On that date, the offender entered a plea of guilty to the offence of manslaughter. The proceedings were then stood over for a sentence hearing on 5 June 2015.
	


Background


	
	The relevant facts on sentence were set out in a document entitled “Crown Facts on Sentence” which was tendered and marked as Exhibit A. The facts as set out in that exhibit were agreed.
	
	
	The facts based thereon may be shortly stated. On the evening of Saturday, 2 November 2013, the offender then 33 years of age, attended a buck’s party for a cousin. The offender met his cousin and friends at a hotel at 7pm. The group drank alcohol whilst they waited for everyone to arrive.
	
	
	By 9.30pm on the same night, the offender, his cousin and friends were in the penthouse at Meriton Apartments in King Street, Sydney, that had been booked for the buck’s party. Food and alcoholic drinks were served.
	
	
	At about 2:25am on Sunday, 3 November 2013, CCTV footage records the offender leaving the Meriton penthouse with five other males.
	
	
	The material events thereafter were recorded by CCTV cameras. The relevant CCTV footage was tendered and became Exhibit “B” in the sentencing proceedings.
	
	
	At about 2:37am the same night, CCTV footage from the Shark Hotel records the offender approaching a security guard outside the entrance of the Shark Hotel with his group behind him. They were refused entry and CCTV footage records the offender and the three males walking away.
	
	
	Between 2:42am and 2:59am, CCTV footage records the movements of the offender and his friends during which period they entered various hotels and continued drinking beer.
	
	
	At 2:54am the CCTV footage from Scruffy Murphy’s Hotel records the deceased, Mr Heward, and their friends, walking past and stopping outside a kebab and pizza shop in Goulburn Street, near George Street, Sydney. The deceased’s friends ordered food from the pizza shop.
	
	
	At about 2:55am, the offender and his group left a hotel and walked towards Scruffy Murphy’s Hotel.
	
	
	At 2:59am, CCTV footage from Scruffy Murphy’s records the offender and his group speaking to the security guards outside that hotel.
	
	
	The security guard refused them entry. The group then walked away.
	
	
	At about 3:02:20am, CCTV footage from Scruffy Murphy’s Hotel records the offender and his group walking past the deceased and Mr Heward. As they did so the offender and one of his friends looked back towards Scruffy Murphy’s Hotel.
	
	
	A witness who was working inside a kebab and pizza store saw the offender yelling back towards Scruffy Murphy’s as he walked. The offender yelled something like “fucking dogs” and was swearing in that direction. The offender then turned and continued walking in the direction of George Street.
	
	
	After he and his group walked past the deceased and Mr Heward, the offender turned around at 3:02:26am and walked with apparent purpose back to Mr Heward.
	
	
	A witness told police that he saw the offender walk back towards a male and yell “What the fuck did you just say?”. He was directing those words to Mr Heward. Mr Heward had his hands in his pocket or by his side and the witness said “He didn’t look prepared for a fight.”
	
	
	The offender then using his right hand struck Mr Heward forcibly to the chin at 3:02:29am without warning. This caused Mr Heward to stumble backwards and fall to the ground. Mr Heward was visibly affected by the assault, though it caused no serious or lasting injury.
	
	
	Mr Rodrigues, who was standing next to Mr Heward, stepped in and used his right hand to punch the offender once to the left‑hand side of his face or head, just before Mr Heward fell to the ground. That blow caused the offender to take a couple of backward steps.
	
	
	Mr Rodrigues then took a step towards the offender and kicked towards him with his right foot. The offender blocked the kick with both his hands and took a backward step. At this time Mr Heward was trying to get off the ground.
	
	
	The offender threw a punch at Mr Rodrigues with his right arm at 3:02:32am that narrowly missed him. Mr Rodrigues stumbled backwards a couple of steps before regaining his balance. The offender moved towards him with his left arm extended towards Mr Rodrigues and threw a forceful punch at him with his right arm at 3:02:34am that connected with the front of Mr Rodrigues’ head. This immediately caused him to fall backwards onto the ground, without stumbling. Mr Rodrigues did not move after falling to the ground. Witnesses heard a large crack and breaking noise.
	
	
	The offender and his group left and crossed George Street and walked back towards the Meriton Apartments in Kent Street.
	
	
	At about 4:11am the CCTV footage records the offender leaving the Meriton penthouse with another. He was then identified to police by a friend of the deceased.
	
	
	At 4:16am on the same morning police arrested the offender. He was cautioned and taken to the Day Street Police Station. He participated in an electronically recorded interview.
	


Injuries to the Deceased


	
	At about 9:23am on Tuesday, 5 November 2013, life was pronounced to be extinct after doctors determined that the deceased had no brain activity.
	
	
	The autopsy report completed by Dr Istvan Sventmariay indicates that the cause of death was blunt force head injury.
	
	
	Dr Sventmariay identified the following:
	


“a.   severe blunt head injury comprising of brain swelling, bilateral subarachnoid haemorrhage, bilateral subdural haemorrhage, extensive bilateral cortical contusions/lacerations with parenchymal extension, and recent infarction;

b.   extensive fragmentation of the brain;

c.   most parts of the right brain hemisphere were herniating through a large craniectomy;

d.   numerous mostly smaller base of the skull fractures;

e.   blunt injuries (bruising and laceration) of the lips and the inner lining of the mouth on the left side, however no teeth or tongue injuries were noted and no maxillary fractures were identified.”

Overview


	
	On the evidence contained in the Agreed Facts, Exhibit A, it is plain that the offender was affected by alcohol and additionally was in an angry state of mind or disposition at the time of the assaults upon the deceased and his friend, Mr Heward. His intoxicated state provides at least a partial explanation for his behaviour but in no way provides either justification or mitigation of the objective seriousness of the offence or the culpability of the offender.
	
	
	The offender had been drinking alcohol on the night from some time after 7pm and continued thereafter having visited hotels until a time not long before the attack upon Mr Rodrigues.
	
	
	On the facts it is clear that at about 2:59am when the security guards at Scruffy Murphy’s Hotel turned the offender and his group away, the offender became angry and abusive, shouting insults at the security guards.
	
	
	As he proceeded to walk past the place where the deceased and Mr Heward were standing, the evidence is that the offender heard a comment which he attributed to Mr Heward. Whatever the precise comment made by Mr Heward or possibly somebody else may have been, the offender took exception to it and his already existing state of anger escalated from that point and led him to deliver a severe punch or hit to Mr Heward’s head causing him to fall to the ground.
	
	
	Mr Rodrigues’ reaction in hitting out at the offender was clearly precipitated by the offender’s assault on his friend with the deceased intervening to prevent any further attack being launched by the offender.
	
	
	The CCTV footage establishes clearly enough that these events moved at a very fast pace. The offender by this time was plainly intent on escalating the violent incident provoked by his own actions towards Mr Heward. The CCTV footage shows the offender delivering a ferocious punch to the deceased’s head. The enormous force of that punch was sufficient to cause him to fall backwards and striking his head without breaking his fall.
	


Subjective Factors


	
	The offender is presently 35 years of age. He was born in 1980 and was therefore 33 years of age at the date of the offence. A considerable amount of material concerning the offender’s family background, his employment and personal life is the subject, firstly, of a report prepared by Anna Robilliard, Forensic Psychologist, and a number of testimonials provided by family members and friends.
	
	
	Ms Robilliard interviewed the offender at Long Bay Gaol on 14 May 2015 and subsequently produced her report of 28 May 2015 which was tendered at the sentence hearing.
	
	
	Ms Robilliard’s report contains a detailed history of the offender’s background, education, employment, relationship history and results of test assessments carried out by her in respect of his intelligence and personality. The history obtained by Ms Robilliard, confirmed in various aspects by certain of the testimonials that have also been tendered in evidence, state that the offender at the age of 18 entered into a traineeship as a security technician and thereafter was employed by a number of companies in relation to work involving the installation of security equipment and related matters. He was employed by a company in that field at the time of the offence. Mr Hassan, General Manager of the company for whom the offender was then working, wrote favourably as to the offender’s personal qualities and his work performance and indicated that he is willing to explore future employment opportunities for him.
	
	
	Ms Robilliard noted that there was no known or family history of mental health issues and that the offender has never been treated for depression or anxiety. The only prior matter noted on his criminal record was mid-range PCA offence dating offence from June 2010.
	
	
	Ms Robilliard noted that the offender has completed a SMART program whilst in custody. The history obtained by Ms Robilliard is consistent with heavy drinking of alcohol on weekends and limited use of stimulant drugs (cocaine) for about 12 months leading up to the offender’s arrest and imprisonment.
	
	
	The offender’s account of the circumstances leading up to and surrounding the offence is inconsistent in certain respects with other evidence. He told Ms Robilliard that he “palmed” Mr Heward in the face. He claimed that he was angry about being refused entry to licenced premises immediately before the incident. He admitted to Ms Robilliard that he had been offended by a comment that came from what is described as “the victim’s group“ and told her that his response was “just an impulsive action.”
	
	
	On assessment, Ms Robilliard stated that the offender scored on intelligence testing a level which placed him toward the middle of the average range.
	
	
	On clinical personality testing, there were no elevated scores on the severe personality pathology scales such as to suggest a diagnosis of personality disorder.
	
	
	The results of testing carried out by Ms Robilliard indicate that there has been a psychological dependence and compulsive use of alcohol by the offender. She considered that his attitude to drugs and alcohol has changed since being charged with the current offence and he stated to her that he believes that his position since then will precipitate a change in his behaviour post-release. Ms Robilliard expressed the opinion that his post-release prognosis seems positive.
	
	
	She noted that he had ongoing support from his immediate family and network of pro-social friends.
	
	
	The testimonials which have been tendered include those from his mother, Mr George Reynolds, Mr Con Lepouris, Gabriella Vasta, George Papoulidis and Olimpia Farma. The testimonials provide a consistent account of a person who has maintained a work ethic and has been a trustworthy person with positive characteristics.
	
	
	A number of testimonials have been tendered on behalf of the offender, each of which I have carefully read and taken into account.
	


Submissions for the Offender


	
	Mr Ozen of counsel who appeared on behalf of the offender, relied upon written submissions dated 4 June 2015 supplemented at the sentence hearing. In the written submissions Mr Ozen incorporated a table setting out the sequence of events as captured on CCTV footage commencing at 3:02:19 through to 3:02:35.
	
	
	As noted in the submissions, the offender and Mr Heward had not known each other prior to the incident and there had been no interaction between them earlier in the night. He submitted that Mr Heward exhibited some interest in the offender and watched him as he went past and appeared to call something out to him.
	
	
	The written submissions then describe the actions of Mr Rodrigues although it was emphasised that there was no attempt made to blame him for his own death. However, his actions were relied upon in order to gauge the objective seriousness of the case.
	
	
	It was conceded that the deceased’s actions on the night were undoubtedly motivated by a desire to defend his friend Mr Heward, however it was submitted that the Court could not find that the offender had an intention to further assault the deceased. A blow was struck to Mr Heward and almost immediately thereafter it was said that the deceased struck the offender. It was submitted that Mr Rodrigues had struck the offender with a very forceful blow which knocked him backwards.
	
	
	The CCTV footage indicated that, before that blow, the offender had not been paying any attention to the deceased and was not intending to fight him.
	
	
	It was submitted that from 3:02:29 onwards Mr Rodrigues had carried out at least two offensive acts towards the offender before the offender retaliated.
	
	
	The offender then threw two punches at him, the first of which did not appear to connect.
	
	
	It was emphasised that the entire incident between the offender and Mr Rodrigues took place within five seconds and no words were exchanged between them prior to Mr Rodrigues being struck. There was no evidence of any hostility between them before 3:02:29 and the offender had not attempted to strike the deceased before that time.
	
	
	Whilst it was submitted that the Court could not conclude that the offender had an intention to cause Mr Rodrigues grievous bodily harm, a reasonable person, in the position of the offender, would have realised that he was exposing the deceased to an appreciable risk of serious or substantial injury when he struck the fatal blow: Wilson v The Queen (1992) 174 CLR 313.
	
	
	It was submitted that the Court would find that the offender committed the offence of manslaughter by reason of an unlawful and dangerous act, namely engaging in a fight with the deceased.
	
	
	It was again emphasised that whilst the offender started the physical altercations by striking Mr Heward, he was not paying any attention at all to Mr Rodrigues.
	
	
	It was submitted that death was most likely occasioned by a combination of the blow from the offender and the deceased’s head hitting the pavement at a time when he had been rendered unconscious by the earlier punch.
	
	
	Apart from the prior offence of driving under the influence, it was submitted that the applicant should be taken as a person with a prior good record for the purposes of sentencing. It was further submitted that there was no evidence to suppose that the offender had a propensity to violence, or an inability to control himself, nor anything in his history to suggest that specific deterrence ought play a prominent role in the sentencing exercise.
	
	
	It was accepted by Mr Ozen that on his own admission the offender had ingested a large amount of alcohol on the night. Reference was appropriately made to the observations by the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Loveridge [2014] NSWCCA 120 concerning the problem of “alcohol fuelled violence”.
	
	
	It was submitted that it was highly unlikely that the offender is a risk of re-offending and that he had an excellent work ethic and was likely to obtain employment on release. It was submitted that his prospects for rehabilitation were very good.
	
	
	It was submitted that none of the aggravating features in s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 apply.
	
	
	Submissions were made as to the appropriate sentence with specific reliance on a number of other cases, in particular, Donaczy v R [2010] NSWCCA 143 and Hopley v R [2008] NSWCCA 105; R v Field [2014] NSWSC 1797; R v Dyer [2014] NSWSC 1809; R v Matthews [2015] NSWSC 49 and R v Lane (No 3) [2015] NSWSC 118. I have considered the judgments in each of those cases. It is sufficient to say that the sentencing in each of them was based upon the individual facts of each of those cases, which differed in certain respects from the factual circumstances to those that arise in the present case.
	
	
	Further submissions were made in relation to the general principle stated by the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Loveridge in the written submissions in which it was noted that the offender in that case had pleaded guilty to one count of manslaughter, one count of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and three counts of assault on different people, all on the one night. Reference was made to the particular circumstances of that case in which the offender had shown earlier in the evening signs of aggressive and agitated behavior and involved himself in assaulting strangers without warning and for no apparent reason.
	
	
	The offender in that case was, at the time of the offences, on conditional liberty for an act of violence.
	
	
	Mr Ozen noted the Court of Criminal Appeal’s reference in Loveridge which reaffirm the importance of general deterrence in cases where violence is perpetrated in a public street and the need for a significant degree of general deterrence in sentencing offenders for offences of violence whilst under the influence of alcohol.
	
	
	Mr Ozen in his detailed and comprehensive written submissions also addressed what he referred to as the “significant facts” in the present case: at [90]-[106]. I have earlier made reference to many of these factual matters.
	
	
	Mr Ozen emphasised that the offender had not been a person who tended to get violent when intoxicated and there was no indication from his history that this was a risk. It was submitted that he was not in an aggressive mood on the night. It was submitted that he was not drinking with the intention of causing any trouble and that he only turned back when he heard what he thought was a derogatory remark yelled at him. It was submitted that after having struck Mr Heward to the face there was no evidence from which the Court could conclude that the offender at that time then intended to take matters further with either Mr Heward or Mr Rodrigues.
	
	
	In addition to the subjective factors to which I have already referred it was submitted that the offender was generally remorseful and carried the guilt of what he has occasioned on his conscience. He had, and continues to have, the support of his family and it was likely, it was submitted, that he would return to employment upon release.
	


Crown Submissions


	
	The Crown submitted that the offender had been earnest in giving evidence and describing his own behavior as “reckless beyond measure” and that this encapsulated the Crown’s submission, which was, that the objective seriousness of this offence was above the middle of the range for a number of reasons.
	
	
	It was submitted that after the offender had been refused entry, his anger was growing which was manifested in the insults that he threw over his shoulder towards the security staff at the Scruffy Murphy’s Hotel.
	
	
	Whether or not Mr Heward had called out words to the effect of “Keep walking”, he was not expecting the punishment that was then meted out to him by the offender. The offender had admitted of the possibility that it was not Mr Heward who had called out the words to which he took offence.
	


Objective Seriousness of the Offence


	
	The physical element for the offence of manslaughter is, of course, the unlawful and dangerous act which causes death. The mental element requires that the act must be willed and not accidental: Wilson v The Queen (1992) 174 CLR 313 at 328. To be found guilty of manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act, the circumstances must be such that a reasonable person in the position of an accused would have realised that he or she was exposing another or others to an appreciable risk of serious injury: Wilson (supra) at 332-4; Regina v KT [2007] NSWSC 83.
	
	
	The maximum penalty for the offence of manslaughter is imprisonment for 25 years. There is no prescribed standard non-parole period.
	
	
	The offender is to be sentenced on the basis of an unlawful and dangerous act that caused the death of the deceased.
	
	
	In assessing the objective seriousness of the offence of manslaughter by way of unlawful and dangerous act, it has been said that there is no hierarchy of seriousness between voluntary and involuntary manslaughter. Spigelman CJ said as much in Regina v Hoerler [2004] NSWCCA 184 at [29].
	
	
	In determining the sentence in the present case, I am required to consider the objective and subjective factors relevant to the offence and the aggravating and mitigating factors in accordance with the provisions of s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 and relevant sentencing principles. I am, in particular, required by law to take account of a number of matters in determining the objective gravity of the offence committed by the offender and the other matters to which I have referred. The sentence to be imposed is one that is appropriate to the particular crime, having regard to the gravity of the offence viewed objectively: Regina v Dodd (1991) 57 A Crim R 349 at 354.
	
	
	Without setting out the provisions of s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, I bear in mind that those provisions seek to identify the relevant objective and subjective factors that establish the aggravating and mitigating circumstances of the offence. That said, I accept, as has been submitted for the offender, that there are no aggravating factors referred to in s 21A(2) that apply to this case.
	
	
	The evidence, however, establishes that the offence of manslaughter in this case involved an unlawful attack involving a number of serious matters.
	
	
	As to the objective seriousness of the offence requires a close and realistic analysis of the events leading up to the encounter involving the attack upon the deceased.
	
	
	The evidence establishes that the offender, before he struck Mr Heward, was in an intoxicated and angry frame of mind. Whilst he described himself in evidence as a “happy drunk” when intoxicated in the past, that was not his condition on 3 November 2013. He had been twice refused entry to hotels at 2:37am and at 2:59am, and at 3:02am was seen directing abusive language at the security guards at Scruffy Murphy’s Hotel.
	
	
	The offender gave evidence at the sentencing hearing. He was asked:
	


“Q.   How do you feel about your actions and your choices on that night?

A.   I think reckless beyond measure, really. Didn’t consider anybody’s welfare or my own welfare.” (T 5 June 2015 at p 7)


	
	In cross-examination the offender agreed that he had seen publicity in the media about the Loveridge case and he understood that there had been great community concern about drunken assaults in public that had fatal consequences: T 12.
	
	
	He agreed that he concluded that the words he heard, and to which he took offence, he believed were spoken by Mr Heward. He based that conclusion on the fact that he was “the closest person in the vicinity; had to have been him”: T 13. He agreed that it was a possibility that someone else said the words other than Mr Heward, though he believed it was Mr Heward: T 14. He agreed that Mr Heward was simply standing there, did not walk up to him. He agreed he was standing with his hands in his pockets and he agreed that Mr Heward was not ready to receive a threat of physical attack: T 13.
	
	
	He agreed there were prior occasions when he had drunk too much: T 14. He denied that he had previously lost his temper when he had drunk excessively and said he was generally “a happy drunk”: T 15. He agreed in cross-examination that Mr Heward had done nothing to deserve being struck.
	
	
	He said he was annoyed when excluded from Scruffy Murphy’s Hotel, was angry when he heard someone call out to him and angry when he hit Mr Heward. He however claimed that he was not angry when he struck Mr Rodrigues but was “a bit disoriented”: T 17.
	
	
	I note at this point that the offender’s mother gave evidence. She said her son is totally devastated about his actions and has had nightmares over the events leading to the death of Mr Rodrigues. She gave evidence that she had never observed, either as an adolescent or young adult, her son exhibiting violent tendencies: T 22.
	
	
	When he turned around and confronted Mr Heward with words to the effect of “what the fuck did you say?”, and struck him, he unleashed his anger. If the words he attributed to Mr Heward were in fact said by Mr Heward, they did not provide any reason or justification for his assault upon Mr Heward. The offender lost all control due to his intoxicated, angry condition.
	
	
	After knocking Mr Heward to the ground, events moved quickly with Mr Rodrigues intervening to help his friend against the angry out of control offender. It is artificial to the point of absurdity to suggest that Mr Rodrigues’s action in hitting the offender is to be seen as a separate unrelated or intervening act by Mr Rodrigues. Mr Rodrigues’ reaction was in the nature of an instinctive or reflex reaction by him directly due to the offender’s aggressive unlawful assault upon Mr Heward and almost instantaneously following Mr Heward’s fall to the ground.
	
	
	It is, in my assessment, quite wrong to segment these fast-moving and tragic events and seek to apportion the events as being partly arising from the offender’s actions and partly from the deceased’s retaliatory reaction leading to the fatal blow delivered by the offender to Mr Rodrigues.
	
	
	The proper analysis of these events is that the offender was wholly responsible for the fatal attack upon Mr Rodrigues. The evidence establishes that Mr Heward and Mr Rodrigues were completely innocent by-standers who were unfortunate enough to be in the same place as the offender.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the objective seriousness of the offence is above the middle of the range of objective seriousness for reasons given in submissions. Mr Ozen in his oral submissions stated that a finding of below mid-range objective seriousness is appropriate.
	
	
	In my assessment, the objective seriousness of the offence of manslaughter in this case is at least mid-range. The matters upon which that assessment is made include:
	



	
	The offender’s intoxicated angry state of mind which contributed to his unprovoked instigation of the offence upon Mr Heward and Mr Rodrigues.
	
	
	The offender’s level of violence meted out to Mr Heward drew Mr Rodrigues into the violent episode he, the offender, initiated.
	
	
	The severity of the offender’s attacks upon Mr Heward and Mr Rodrigues who, before the attacks commenced, were simply enjoying a night out without any interference or provocation by Mr Heward or the deceased.
	
	
	The force with which the offender struck Mr Heward, causing him to fall to the ground, evidences a state of mind which continued up to and including the forceful punch to the head of Mr Rodrigues, which propelled him backwards hitting his head on the pavement without breaking his fall.
	



	
	This is a case of alcohol-fuelled violence of a high order. It is not in the type of case of injury inflicted in the course of a drunken brawl involving an offender and victim. On the findings made to which I have earlier referred, the offender drew the deceased into a violent confrontation which was entirely of his own making.
	


Offending of this type in NSW


	
	The Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Loveridge [2014] NSWCCA 120 examined sentencing in what is described as one-punch manslaughter cases both in the United Kingdom and in New South Wales: at [208]-[220]. The Court noted observations that had been expressed in the United Kingdom as to the unnecessary violence such offences create and justified increase in public concern with people expecting “their streets to be safe”: Attorney-General under s 36 Criminal Justice Act 1988 [2005] EWCA Crim 812 per Judge LJ at [15]. In that case, the observation was made at [12]:
	


“The manslaughter cases with which we are concerned involved gratuitous, unprovoked violence in the streets of the kind which seriously discourages the law-abiding citizens from walking their streets, particularly at night and gives the city and town centres over to the kind of drunken yobbery with which we have become familiar, and a worried perception among decent citizens that it is not safe to walk the streets at night.”


	
	The Court in Loveridge stated that this statement echoed loudly the context of the appeal in Loveridge and it, of course, echoes loudly in the present case.
	
	
	Although reference is often made to one-punch or single-punch manslaughter cases as constituting a particular class of case, as the Court in Loveridge observed the circumstances of these cases vary widely: at [215]. Additionally, in Loveridge the Court of Criminal Appeal stated that the commission of offences of violence, including manslaughter, in the context of alcohol-fuelled conduct in a public street or public place, is of great concern to the community and calls for an emphatic sentencing response to give particular effect to the need for denunciation, punishment and general deterrence. It is clear in the present case that the sentence to be imposed must, in an appropriate way, give effect to the principle of general deterrence in the sentencing exercise.
	
	
	I have previously referred to the fact that a number of sentencing cases have been referred to in the course of the submissions for the offender. Such cases, of course, do not disclose a range or tariff. When sentencing for manslaughter, a court is always to have regard to the full context in which death has occurred. The surrounding circumstances may bear upon the objective gravity of the offence and the moral culpability of the offender: Loveridge at [229] and cases therein referred to.
	
	
	There are some similarities to the facts in Loveridge to this case although there are also facts that distinguish that case from the present, including the fact that in that case the offender had a history of violent offences and was the subject to conditional liberty at the time of the offence in question.
	
	
	It is to be remembered of course in sentencing that the branch of the criminal law encompassing involuntary manslaughter reflects the value placed by the law upon human life: R v Lavender [2005] HCA 37; 222 CLR 67 at 87 [60]; Loveridge at [231].
	
	
	The attack upon Mr Rodrigues was, as in the case of Loveridge, both cowardly and unprovoked. It is a serious example of unlawful and dangerous act manslaughter which deserves substantial punishment. The offender in the present case, as I have earlier noted, was aged 33 years of age at the time of the offence, the offender in Loveridge was 18 years and 4 months. There is no equivalent circumstance in the present case to that case in terms of a deprived upbringing as the offender in the present case appears to have had a generally supportive family background. In determining the sentence I have, of course, brought into account all of the subjective factors in the present case including the fact that this is the first time the offender has been in custody. Equally, I have had regard, as earlier indicated, to the fact that general deterrence and specific deterrence are most significant factors. Although there is no evidence of prior instances of alcohol-fuelled violence by the offender, the facts and circumstances of the present case, so far as specific deterrence is concerned, indicates that the offender has a potential vulnerability to outbursts of violence in circumstances where excessive drinking and frustration and/or anger combine. On this basis, I consider that specific deterrence is a factor to be given some consideration and weight as appropriate in the sentencing exercise.
	


Victim Impact Statements


	
	Victim Impact Statements prepared on behalf of the parents and sister of Lucio Rodrigues were received by the Court. The statements express in clear and very dignified terms on behalf of the family the grievous effect and the immense loss arising from the death of their son and brother and the impact it has had upon each one of them. The loss of a young man of great promise in the circumstances with which this case is concerned is exceptionally painful and tragic and the cause of overwhelming grief. On behalf of the Court I extend my condolences to the family of the deceased, Mr Rodrigues, for the immense loss that they have endured and will continue to endure. Nothing of course can address the immense loss that has occurred.
	
	
	I have noted the provisions of Division 2, ‘Victim Impact Statements’ of Part 3 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, in particular, s 28 thereof. I have, of course, closely considered the victim impact statements in this case as significant material before the Court. In determining the sentence to be imposed I have based my determination on the evidence and findings to which I have referred above. As there were no submissions made in relation to s 28 of that Act, I have determined that any sentence should not be increased by virtue of the statements to which Division 2 applies.
	


Form 1 Offence


	
	The offender has come before this Court for sentence on a charge of manslaughter with an offence of Assault Occasioning Actual Bodily Harm to Mr Heward to be taken into account on a Form 1.
	
	
	Mr Ozen of counsel in his written supplementary submissions dated 11 June 2015 has comprehensively addressed the Form 1 offence, which the offender has requested be taken into account on sentence.
	
	
	The principles that determine the proper approach to sentencing for Form 1 offences were addressed in the guideline decision Attorney General’s Application No 1 of 2002 (2002) 56 NSWLR 146, in particular, at paragraphs [39]-[45] which are conveniently set out in Mr Ozen’s written submissions.
	
	
	The issue, as has been submitted on the offender’s behalf, is whether there is a need for, having regard to the Form 1 offence, a greater emphasis on personal deterrence and the element of retribution for the additional offence. The submission was that the Court would not make the sentence for the principal offence more severe than it would otherwise have been, or, in the alternative, any increase in severity ought to be a modest one for reasons set out in the submissions.
	
	
	As I have already indicated, the issue of personal deterrence is a matter to which I have had regard and brought into account in determining the sentence to be imposed in respect of the offence of manslaughter and in sentencing the offender I consider no greater emphasis need be given in respect of that aspect by reason of the Form 1 offence.
	
	
	I have concluded that the sentence which I propose to impose in respect of the offence of manslaughter to which the offender has pleaded, sufficiently in itself addresses both the issue of personal deterrence and the element of retribution. The assault upon Mr Heward was a circumstance to which I have had specific regard in determining the culpability of the offender in respect of the offence charged, it being integrally linked to the assault upon Mr Rodrigues as I have earlier stated.
	


Remorse


	
	There is evidence of remorse by the offender both in his evidence, his mother’s evidence, and the materials that have been tendered and received as exhibits in these proceedings.
	
	
	I proceed upon the basis that the evidence does establish that the offender is remorseful for his offending conduct and I have taken that into account in determining the sentence to be imposed. I consider on the evidence his prospects of rehabilitation to be reasonable.
	
	
	I consider the offender’s prospects of rehabilitation to be reasonable.
	


Special Circumstances


	
	It was submitted on behalf of the offender that a finding of special circumstances is appropriate upon the basis that the Court would recognise that the offender’s incarceration in respect of the subject offence represents his first time in prison.
	
	
	As I have earlier indicated in the consideration of the offender’s subjective circumstances I have had regard to and brought into account the particular matters that have been identified in the evidence and in submissions, including the fact that this is the first time the offender has been in custody. Upon consideration I do not consider that special circumstances ought to be found upon the basis that has been advanced. Application of the statutory ratio in the present case will, I consider, maintain what I consider to be the requisite non-parole period having regard, in particular, to the objective seriousness of the offence, including the issues of personal and general deterrence.
	
	
	Accordingly, I do not propose to make any adjustment to the statutory ratio on the offence in question on the basis of special circumstances.
	
	
	For the purpose of the offender’s guilty plea the Crown accepted that the plea was an early plea. There was no dispute that the maximum discount for the early plea of 25% is appropriate.
	


Sentence


	
	Having regard to all the subjective and objective factors before the application of the 25% discount for the offender’s plea of guilty a head sentence of 12 years imprisonment is appropriate for the offence of manslaughter in this case.
	
	
	After the application of the 25% discount, the head sentence to be imposed is a term of imprisonment for 9 years.
	
	
	Nicholas Lambaditis, you are convicted of the offence of manslaughter. I sentence you to a non-parole period of imprisonment of 6 years and 9 months to commence on 3 November 2013 and to expire on 2 August 2020. There will be a parole period of 2 years and 3 months to commence on 3 August 2020 and to expire on 2 November 2022. Accordingly, the head sentence is a term of imprisonment for 9 years with a non-parole period of 6 years and 9 months. The first date upon which you will be eligible to be released to parole accordingly will be on 3 August 2020.

		12 June 2015",2015-06-11 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2703262,R v GRIFFIN [2015] NSWDC 304,"SENTENCE


	
	HIS HONOUR: Nathan Terence Griffin appears today for sentence in relation to an offence committed contrary to s 97(1) Crimes Act 1900. This is an offence of attempted robbery in company which carries a maximum penalty of twenty years’ imprisonment, but has no standard non-parole period. I am required to take into account on a Form 1 an offence of intentional damage to property in company, contrary to s 195(1A) Crimes Act, the details of which I will refer to shortly in a moment.
	
	
	The plea of guilty entered by the prisoner to the offence for which he is for sentence today was entered at the first reasonable opportunity, it is agreed between the parties, and thus he is entitled to a discount of 25% upon the otherwise appropriate sentence, to recognise the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty in accordance with the guideline judgment of Thomson & Houlton.
	
	
	The matter on the Form 1 is to be taken into account in accordance with those principles set out in the guideline judgment in relation to Form 1 matters from 2002, that is, Attorney General’s Application No 1 (2002) 56 NSWLR 147, particularly in the judgment of the Chief Justice at [18] - [43]. There his Honour talked about the need in the appropriate case, when taking into account a matter or matters on Form 1, to give greater weight to personal deterrence and the community’s entitlement to extract retribution. It may be that the entire point of the process is to impose a longer sentence than would otherwise be appropriate for the principal offence if it had stood alone, or alter the character of the appropriate sentence for the principal offence.
	
	
	The sentencing process is, of course, only concerned with what is described in the Act as the “principal offence”, not to determine an appropriate sentence for matters listed on a Form 1. It is the case, however, in this particular matter, having regard to the contextual circumstances of the offending and the character of the offending on the Form 1, that greater weight upon personal deterrence is not required in this sentencing exercise.
	
	
	Before I turn to the facts of the matter, the sentence matter came before me last Friday when I was involved in assisting the list judge with sentence matters that were listed for hearing on that day. I had originally started a ‘common law’ sentencing matter which could not continue and then the learned Crown Prosecutor in this matter appeared in my court. Ultimately, I took another matter of hers to save her having to go back to the list judge.
	
	
	I was not able to sentence the offender on Friday afternoon, the matter was interrupted by other work that I had which was part heard, but the conduct of the matter, both in the production of the evidence and in the discussion of the relevant issues to be considered in the sentencing exercise with which I am concerned, led me to the conclusion that this was a case in which, notwithstanding the significance of the guideline judgment in the decision of R v Henry & Ors (1999) NSWCCA 111 the prisoner should be given a good behaviour bond. There were a number of relevant issues that fashioned the ultimate determination of the matter.
	
	
	I should point out, as the transcript of the proceedings on Friday would reveal, truncated as they were by interruptions and the like, the Crown was very concerned about the character of the material that had been produced by the defence, particularly the reliance upon some historical diagnosis of the young offender. The Crown’s concerns were quite proper. But ultimately the matter was resolved in a very common sense way by the Crown ultimately speaking to a treating doctor of the prisoner who had apparently provided a great deal of information to the psychiatrist whose reports were produced to the Court, setting out some of the mental disabilities suffered by the prisoner.
	
	
	The effect of all of that material was to invoke consideration of what is set out in a number of judgments of the Court of Criminal Appeal, but probably most eloquently in the judgment of McClellan J in DPP v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194. That was an appeal brought by the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions and involved consideration of a number of significant issues, both constitutional and otherwise, related to the sentencing of Commonwealth offenders.
	
	
	The learned Chief Judge at Common Law in the judgment he gave, amongst a number of judgments given in that case, reflected upon the relevance of mental illness, intellectual handicap or other mental problems which the Courts have developed principles to apply in sentencing, citing a number of judgments well known to practitioners of the criminal law and summarising their effect. His Honour stated at [177] - [178]:
	


“Where the state of a person’s mental health contributes to the commission of the offence in a material way, the offender’s moral culpability may be reduced. Consequently, the need to denounce the crime may be reduced with a reduction in sentence”.


	
	He also said:
	


“It may also have the consequence that the offender is an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence, resulting in a reduction of the sentence which otherwise would be imposed. It may mean also that a custodial sentence will weigh more heavily on that person. It may reduce or eliminate the significance of special or specific deterrence. However, conversely, it may be that because of the person’s mental illness or disability, they present more of a danger to the community.”


	
	In those circumstances, considerations of specific deterrence may result in an increased sentence, as was the case, for example, in Robert Vincent Veen’s matter, determined by the High Court in 1988.
	
	
	His Honour said at [178]:
	


“I should stress that the mental health problems of an offender need not amount to a serious psychiatric illness before they will be relevant to the sentencing process. The circumstances may indicate that when an offender has a mental disorder of modest severity, it may nevertheless be appropriate to moderate the need for general or specific deterrence”.


	
	In this particular matter, it is clear in my mind, having regard to the detail of Dr Cassimatis’ reports, which I will summarise shortly, but particularly the history available from the prisoner’s “advocate” who works for Action for People with Disabilities, that the prisoner has suffered from a number of significant mental disorders and disabilities over a long period of time that have very much fashioned his life. The material available to me establishes, at least on balance, that the prisoner suffers from disabilities which make him amenable to manipulation and influence, even from people who are younger than he.
	
	
	It is apparent on the evidence available in this matter that although the prisoner was the eldest, as I understand it, of the offenders who were involved in the primary offence to which the prisoner has pleaded guilty, and whilst it is apparent on the facts that at one point that the group of offenders were travelling in the prisoner’s motor vehicle, it was not the prisoner who could be regarded as the primary mover of relevant events. It is the case that the prisoner’s conditions had let him into the situation where he felt a need to associate with people and go along with what they may suggest, in order to maintain some recognition or respect from the peer group that he had adopted at that particular time.
	
	
	Thus, in the circumstances of this matter, I am satisfied that in respect of those five matters identified by the learned Chief Judge at Common Law, the first four have relevance in this sentencing exercise. The conditions of the prisoner, however, do not present the prisoner as a danger to the community thus requiring greater weight to be given to specific deterrence.
	
	
	Another aspect of the matter requiring consideration is in the context of the relevance of the guideline judgment, as has been advocated by the learned Crown Prosecutor and recognised in the written submissions of counsel for the prisoner, is the need to give full effect to individualised justice.
	
	
	Subsequent to Henry, of course, authorities of the Court of Criminal Appeal have reflected upon the fact that the guideline judgment was precisely that, it was a guideline, not a tram line. It is often forgotten, however, that the learned Chief Justice who gave the primary judgment in Henry also reflected upon the need for ‘individualised justice’, notwithstanding the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal to effect a guideline for offences of “armed robbery”, having regard to the criteria or common features of armed robberies dealt with in the District Court, for example set out at [162] of the judgment.
	
	
	His Honour adopted with approval what had been said by Mahoney ACJ in the decision of Lattouf, an unreported decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal. In that judgment, the Acting Chief Justice had said,
	


“General principles must of their nature be adjusted to the individual case if justice is to be achieved. For this reason it is my opinion important in the public interest that the sentencing process recognise and maintain a residual discretion in the sentencing judge. There is a public interest in the adoption and articulation of sentencing principles that will deter the commission of serious crime and punish those who commit it...but there are other interests to which the sentencing process must have regard, these are other objectives which the sentencing process must seek to achieve. Paramount amongst these is the achievement of justice in the individual case”.


	
	This leads me to another matter of high principle that has been reflected in a number of judgments of the Court of Criminal Appeal over a number of years. In the decision of R v Blackman and Walters [2001] NSWCCA 121, the then Chief Judge at Common Law Wood J, in an early decision reflecting upon the appropriateness of suspended sentences for serious crime in that matter. Although I draw no comparison with this matter. There were crimes far more serious in those proceedings than the matter with which I am concerned where the learned sentencing judge at first instance had ordered suspended sentences. His Honour reflected upon principles that have been laid down in previous authorities concerning the sentencing of young offenders.
	
	
	One such judgment was Yardley v Betts (1979) 22 SASR 108, particularly at 112-3 in the judgment of King CJ. There the learned Chief Justice had said with the approval later of Wood J:
	


“The protection of the community is also contributed to by the successful rehabilitation of offenders. This aspect of sentencing should never be lost sight of and it assumes particular importance in the case of first offenders and others who have not developed settled criminal habits. If a sentence had the effect of turning an offender towards a criminal way of life, the protection of the community is to that extent impaired. If the sentence induces or assists an order (sic) to avoid offending in future, the protection of the community is to that extent enhanced. To say that the criminal law exists for the protection of the community is not to say that severity is to be regarded as the sentencing norm.”


	
	In this matter the other significant, if I might call it, contextual legal issue to consider is the issue of orders that have been made in relation to co-offenders. In that regard, I note that two of the co-offenders, including a person who as I understand the facts presented to me took some responsibility for providing some leadership in relation to the commission of the offence, are still awaiting sentence or determination by adult courts. However, three of the offenders were young offenders who were dealt with at various times in the Children’s Court throughout 2014. Their names are not important but it is noted that each of them received probation orders without conviction for varying lengths of time between 12 months and nine months.
	
	
	I am mindful of the fact, of course, that they were dealt with under a different sentencing regime than that with which we are concerned at the moment and were thus amenable to a jurisdictional maximum penalty far less than that provided for in this matter. That having been said, of course, there is a great deal of authority that speaks of the need for courts in sentencing offenders not to completely ignore the fact that other offenders have been treated in a particular way even if dealt with, for example, in the Children’s Court where they would be subject to lesser penalties than would be the case if they had appeared in the District Court.
	
	
	One authority I cite in that regard includes KT [2008] NSWCCA 51 [22]-[26]. This issue was also discussed in other authorities dealing with the approach of sentencing of children committing adult crimes such as HJ and MS2, decisions of the Court of Criminal Appeal.
	
	
	What I understand of the medical evidence relating to this particular prisoner reflects the fact that, although he was born in 1993 and thus at the time of the commission of the offence with which I am concerned was 20 years of age, by reason of the various conditions described by Dr Cassimatis he could not be regarded as a mature person for that age. Maturity is a significant matter and it is not confined in its consideration to people that are to be treated as children. This much was discussed by Hodgson JA in the decision of BP [2010] NSWCCA 159. Hodgson JA at [4]-[5] noted that maturity was not something that it was to be identified as falling definitely one side of the age of majority and that it is important to remember that in dealing with young people that: “Emotional maturity and impulse control develop progressively during adolescence and early adulthood and may not be fully developed until early to mid-twenties”. Of course, in this particular matter, that reflection is not the reflection upon a person without burdens to bear in relation to his mental state, but relating to a young person who has significant burdens to bear which he has had to bear for a lengthy period of time.
	
	
	The facts involve an attempted robbery without any real preplanning beyond the fact that a number of the offenders armed themselves with knives, committed upon a man working alone and going about his business at a bakehouse at Collaroy Plateau. The victim was confronted by a number of young offenders as he was having a cigarette as I understand it and heard a noise within the premises. The young offenders were variously described as being between 15 and 17 or 18 years of age. Amongst these offenders was, of course, the prisoner who must have presented as younger than his stated years. The four men or young men that confronted the victim called out for money at which time the victim had the presence of mind to pick up a tray and held the tray above his head and yelled out, “I’ll fucking kill you” at which the males turned around and ran from the premises with the victim giving chase.
	
	
	It is quite clear as an aggravating factor in this matter that the victim was a vulnerable person in that he was alone at the time confronted by a number of young men with a poorly thought out plan to obtain money in circumstances where it is quite clear they had neither the determination, nor the wherewithal to carry out their threats, This is consistent with what one of the co-accused explained to police in a lengthy interview that, whilst they armed themselves with the knives, they had no intention of causing harm with them. That having been said, as with any armed robbery, the threat of violence to the victim must have caused the victim considerable distress. I do not have a victim impact statement but I would assume that he was affected by this. People working alone at night have a real reason to be concerned for their welfare at the best of times and have their security compromised as this victim’s security was compromised obviously would have long term effects upon that person.
	
	
	I have had regard to the detail of the interview given by the co-accused. The prisoner himself was apparently identified as a suspect. There was an operation undertaken to obtain evidence surreptitiously which included what as I understand it was an admission made by the prisoner to another person. The prisoner was arrested on 4 June 2014. As I understand the matter, he spent no time in custody.
	
	
	Three days after the commission of the offence, which I have described as the principal offence, the prisoner on 27 February for no reason that provides any form of explanation, in company with other people smashed the window of a hairdressing salon in Balgowlah. This was just a wanton act of vandalism. There is no suggestion the prisoner and the co-offenders were seeking to obtain money and why they set about doing what they did is not fully explained beyond as I have earlier pointed out a level of maturity at least reposing in this particular prisoner.
	
	
	I have a presentence report which reflects upon the background of the prisoner. He lives with his family but without going into the detail of it, it would appear both his mother and father suffer from significant mental illnesses or disorders. The prisoner has had a history of disrupted education, primarily arising from him being bullied at school apparently since early childhood and has changed high schools on at least two or three occasions.
	
	
	He has had other traumatic events referred to in various histories, including what apparently was a serious assault committed upon him by his brother and a significant motor vehicle accident in 2013 when he was an apprentice motor mechanic which cost him his employment because of his inability to continue the apprenticeship. He currently has employment working on a casual basis he said in his evidence before me for 32 hours a week, earning what I would take to be for his age a considerable amount of money. He is undertaking a horticultural course at TAFE.
	
	
	He has a background of drug and alcohol abuse and that includes regular use of cannabis. It would appear that cannabis use or drug use and alcohol use is relevant to understanding the context in which he and his co-offenders committed the offence with which I am concerned, that is the principle offence. In that regard what Wood J said in the judgment of Henry, to which I earlier referred, at [273]. Particularly reflecting upon the impulsiveness of offending, the circumstances of assessing the progress of the rehabilitation of the prisoner, are of particular pertinence.
	
	
	What has emerged from the report from the Community Corrections Service and from the evidence of the prisoner is that after a number of false steps since his arrest in relation to this matter, the prisoner has turned his life around considerably. Apart from obtaining the employment to which I have referred, the prisoner has been drug free for quite a number of months and has now a far more settled situation. Firstly, there has been the effect upon him of the curfew that was part of his bail conditions. Secondly, there has been his involvement in surf lifesaving, the fact he is working, the fact he apparently is in a stable relationship at the moment and most importantly the fact he is now taking his medication, which he was not taking regularly in February 2014. This was medication that he had been required to take for many years before.
	
	
	He is involved in study endeavouring to better himself and obtain qualifications and also not associating with members of his peer group, who are the subject of various comments in the advocate’s extensive letter to the Court. The evidence reveals that after his commission of the offences with which I am concerned, but before his arrest on 4 June, the prisoner established a therapeutic relationship with a psychiatrist and has an ongoing relationship with a psychologist. Each of whom have been able to stabilise the condition of the prisoner, particularly by ensuring that the prisoner maintains his regime of medication.
	
	
	The prisoner, when he was six years old, was diagnosed with epilepsy and he has in the past been under the care of a paediatrician, Dr Duffy, the doctor who spoke to the learned Crown Prosecutor after being contacted by counsel for the prisoner during the course of proceedings on Friday. The prisoner has been diagnosed as a child with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and also Autism Spectrum Disorder. There was reference to the prisoner suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder but my reading of the report revealed that to be an “acute” condition, as I understand it, either in reaction to or as a consequence of the assault committed upon him or the motor vehicle accident in which he was involved and in which he was lucky to survive.
	
	
	He has since his arrest in relation to this matter been admitted to Manly Hospital when suffering symptoms of depression and feeling suicidal. However, there is, as I said, a stabilisation of his circumstances, particularly with his taking of medication Concerta and Epilim for his epilepsy. Concerta, as I understand it, is a drug designed to quell the symptoms of his ADHD in the manner that Ritalin would be expected to do.
	
	
	Dr Cassimatis, as I said, prepared two reports, one dated 29 May 2014 obviously prepared before he was arrested in relation to the current matters, the other more pertinent to these proceedings in a direct sense being dated 10 March 2015. Of course the significance of a report prepared before he was arrested in relation to these matters is that it shows conditions of the prisoner existing that have not been fashioned to meet the exigencies of forensic difficulties. In other words, the prisoner does suffer from genuine conditions that have not been reflected upon after the prisoner has been charged with serious criminal offences as often happens with reports provided to this Court. His ADHD I hasten to say gives effect to various symptoms. These include impulsivity, inattention to detail and other conduct activities which are reflected in his participation in the current offence.
	
	
	He is a person who is said to be, by Dr Cassimatis, amenable to medical treatment and particularly medication. He notes in the most recent report that there was at one point some suggestion the prisoner might also suffer from schizophrenia. He had a very bad reaction, as a lot of people did, to the Lindt Cafe siege although of course he had nothing to do with that but it is not believed that he suffers from schizophrenia. On reflection, throughout late 2014 and 2015 there have been improvements in his sleeping and his willingness to obey directions from his psychologist and his medical practitioner.
	
	
	I have an analyst’s report that was obtained from late May indicating that there was no evidence of cannabis or other prohibited drugs in his system. I mention the fact the prisoner has involvement with lifesaving. I have some references from people involved in the lifesaving movement. It would appear as though the prisoner’s grandfather is well known in the Freshwater Lifesaving Club and has received a medal of the Order of Australia for his services to lifesaving and is a life member of the club. I am mindful of the fact that the advocate in her lengthy report which has been most helpful reflected upon his involvement in lifesaving as being somewhat superficial. However, one of the referees confirms that in the last two years he has completed 150 patrol hours, he has developed good relationships within the club and is a valued member of the club. It seems as though a lot of his involvement in the club has improved and increased since he has embarked upon the treatment regime recommended by his doctor along with the counselling from his psychologist.
	
	
	The prisoner wrote a letter to the Court expressing his apology for his involvement in this matter. He gave reasons for what he believed to be his involvement in the matter, particularly reflecting upon the fact that he believes he was “quite easily led”. He wrote in my view, quite perceptively, “I have lost courage in myself as a person and I would also do things to impress my friends.” This is a matter, as I said earlier, where the advocate, who has had involvement with the prisoner for it appears over ten years, has identified as one of his many problems. Her letter or report reflects upon domestic circumstances which have not been dwelt upon in submission but suggests there are environmental factors at work adversely affecting the prisoner.
	
	
	The young prisoner in giving evidence, notwithstanding his limitations and disabilities, to my mind was impressive. I obtained the impression from him that he had turned a corner. In Wood J’s judgment in Henry he spoke about offenders being “at the crossroads”. A matter that, as was discussed in the South Australian decision of Osenkowski, is to be considered in reflecting upon the appropriate disposition of a matter one way or the other. In this matter when I refer to one way or the other I refer to either imposing an order that would not require the prisoner to serve an immediate term of imprisonment as opposed to the imposition of full time custody.
	
	
	The expression “at the crossroads” is one of course that judges are confronted with from time to time. Many times of course the offender about whom that expression is used is not only not at the crossroads. But not even travelling on the same road towards the crossroads but the overwhelming weight of the evidence in this matter suggests the prisoner is a person at the crossroads who can be aided in the manner discussed in Yardley and Betts to be persuaded to attend upon the responsibilities he now has and progress in a way from a life of offending.
	
	
	I was impressed by the prisoner’s commitment to his psychologist and his involvement in the organisation Headspace, an organisation of which I have some knowledge. I am impressed by the fact the prisoner has endeavoured to stop the use of cannabis and the use of alcohol, although he does drink occasionally. He understands of course that alcohol is not appropriate to be consumed, given the medication he has taken and I am impressed by the fact he has been able to find employment.
	
	
	It was in this context of course, that I considered the position of the parties. The matter was of the subject of lengthy submission from either the Crown or the defence. The learned Crown is, in the context of the Barbaro decision, limited in what she can say about the matter. Of course, nothing she says about the matter, binds the Director in his ultimate view of it. The truth is the Crown’s approach was both appropriate and realistic insofar as she submitted the Crown was not far removed from the submissions of the prisoner’s counsel about the ultimate disposition of the matter.
	
	
	Accepting that the offence fits within the criteria of the guideline but noting, in the fixing of the guideline, the Court was anxious to ensure that purposes of sentencing now reflected in s 3A of the Act, particularly general deterrence and personal deterrence, were recognised, the principles that are set out in, for example, De La Rosa and Hemsley cited in the written submissions of the prisoner speak of lesser weight being given to them. Thus, providing a proper basis for departure from the guideline as the judges of the Court of Criminal Appeal recognise could occur even in the decision of Henry.
	
	
	It was conceded in the written submissions that the aggravating factors under s 21A(2) of the Act involve the use of weapons and the fact the victim was vulnerable. These aggravating factors, as well as mitigating factors, set out in s 21A were promulgated by the legislature well after the guideline judgment of Henry was handed down. Ultimately, in the absence of any evidence from the victim and noting what I have said earlier about what might have been to be expected as the effect upon him, I have concluded that there are many mitigating features, including the fact that the injury emotional harm suffered by the victim was not substantial, the prisoner had no record of previous convictions, I am prepared to accept that in the context of his peer relationships he was a person of good character shown in the testimonials that have provided.
	
	
	At this point I am prepared to accept the prisoner is unlikely to reoffend and given the steps he has taken since his arrest he has good prospects of rehabilitation. From his oral evidence and the written document provided to the Courts, I accept that he has shown relevant remorse by taking responsibility for his actions. His plea of guilty, of course, is a mitigating factor but he receives a discrete discount for that.
	
	
	With regard to his criminal history, as I understand his criminal history at the time of the commission of this offence he had no prior criminal convictions, I note, however, that he was it would seem subsequent to being charged in relation to the current matter, charged with an offence for possession of prohibited drug for which he received an order under s 10. My understanding of the chronology and the evidence is that there was some hiatus, for want of a better word, after his arrest when he continued to use drugs and abuse alcohol and the stability that has come to his life is something that has come some months after being charged in relation to the current matter. But having said that as I said there were a number of matters that emerged from the evidence which were to his credit and have been taken into account.
	
	
	So far as the purposes of sentencing are concerned, of course, s 3A sets out a number of matters to be taken into account. Of course, some weight must be given to general and personal deterrence but as I said for reasons I have outlined that might be ameliorated in this matter to some extent. Furthermore, the promotion of the prisoner’s rehabilitation is a relevant matter, he has to be denounced for his conduct and made accountable. The order that I propose will, in my view, give effect to that. In that regard, I note what Howie J said in the decision Zamagias from 2002 as to the proper approach in imposing a term of imprisonment that might otherwise or ultimately be suspended. In that regard, his Honour cited, of course, the decision of the High Court in Dinsdale v The Queen (2000) 202 CLR 321. The approach that his Honour outlined is the approach that I have taken in this matter. First of all, I have determined what the appropriate sentence should be for the principal offence having regard to the matter on the Form 1, applying the relevant discount and then having determined what the appropriate sentence should be, I have turned my mind to whether in fact having regard to s 5 of the Act the sentence of imprisonment I impose could be served by some other means other than full time custody. At this point of the prisoner’s life it is my view that imprisonment is not the appropriate order to make although it still remains an option available to the Court at some future time over the next two years.
	
	
	This brings me to really the major matter of debate and it was a matter that took a great deal of the Court’s time. The learned Crown Prosecutor in her submissions to me pointed out that while the Court may consider a consider a term of imprisonment that might permit alternatives to full time custody. The Court might consider whether, in fact, the term of imprisonment might be served by way of intensive correction order. I have considered the matter in the appropriate way as I have said, not concerned with outcomes, but more concerned with an appropriate penalty and then turning to the alternatives that arise. In considering whether in fact I should order that the offender be assessed for an intensive correction order I have determined that given the regime the prisoner is presently subject to and given the progress that he has made, given the fact that he has full time employment, the strict requirements of an intensive correction order may not serve the purpose of rehabilitation of the prisoner as much as supervision by the Community Corrections Service ensuring the prisoner pursues the current regime of work and medical treatment and counselling that he has. In other words, in my mind at this point the advantages of the prisoner being subject to perhaps the less rigorous regime of supervision under a good behaviour bond would be the better course. Of course, I gave very close consideration to what the Crown said about the matter and it was as it turned out the major matter of struggle in determining the ultimate disposal of the case.
	
	
	The facts of the matter are that by placing the prisoner on a bond the prisoner’s supervision in part will still remain with the Court. If the prisoner was given an intensive correction order then the supervision of the prisoner falls to the Commissioner for Corrective Service as is well known and the matter passes from the hands of the Court. I am not suggesting in the appropriate case that that is a bad thing but in this particular case I believe the supervision of the prisoner remaining with the Court is a preferable option. I can be informed by Community Corrections on progressive bases as to the progress of the prisoner and, of course, the prisoner should understand that if he fails to be of good behaviour or he fails to comply with conditions of the bond he runs the risk of the bond being revoked and being sentenced to a term of imprisonment.
	
	
	I have been very grateful to counsel for the prisoner, very extensive written submissions. The ultimate assessment of the matter does not require further elucidation of what is set out in those written submissions much of it was not in dispute from the position of the Crown.
	
	
	Just stand up thanks very much, Mr Griffin. In relation to the offence for which you have pleaded guilty taking into account the matter on the Form 1 you are convicted. You are sentenced to a term of imprisonment of two years. That term of imprisonment, however, is suspended on you entering into a bond to be of good behaviour for the period of two years. Conditions of that bond will be as follows: You will be required to be of good behaviour. Secondly, you will be required to appear before this Court if called upon to do so. Thirdly, you will advise the Registrar of the Sydney District Court or the Registrar of the Criminal Listing Directorate of the District Court of any change of residential address. Fourthly, you will be required to be subject to the supervision of the Community Corrections Service for the period of the bond and obey all reasonable directions of the Service particularly directions in relation to medical and psychological treatment and counselling. Fifthly, you will be required to report to the officer-in-charge of the Community Corrections Service at Dee Why within seven days of today to give effect to that supervision. Just take a seat thanks very much.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Madam Crown, any technical matters from you?
	
	
	SWEENEY: Just noting that is dated from today.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: The order obviously dates from today. It commences from the moment he enters the bond.
	
	
	Anything from you sir?
	
	
	HEFFERNAN: No your Honour.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Mr Griffin, I will permit you to leave the dock and you can go and take a seat behind your counsel. Are you able to take your client up to level 3?
	
	
	HEFFERNAN: Your Honour, I will.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: In the context of giving these remarks, I take into account, of course, the assessment of the Community Corrections Service, which I neglected to refer to earlier which reflected upon his history of mental health issues and drug dependency and his acknowledgment of the gravity of his actions and his intent to continue engaging in intervention that supports his path towards rehabilitation. The Community Corrections Service noted that expressed intent along with ongoing family support offers some encouragement toward the view that he may yet overcome his challenges in day to day lawful community living. Yes, thank you.
	
	
	Now, what you have got to understand, Mr Griffin, is I will receive reports from Community Corrections about your progress, I have the power to call you up, that is, to bring you back to court, send out a notice, ask you to come back to court to get you to explain yourself and if needs be revoke the bond that I have given and then determine whether you should be committed to prison or not as the case may be so you must understand that it obligatory for you to be of good behaviour. Secondly, to comply with the conditions of the bond and primarily obey the reasonable directions of the Community Corrections Service. Thanks very much, just take a seat, thank you. I will just sign those order now if you will bear with me and I will send those up to the Registry and if you can take your client to level 3. I wish you well, Mr Griffin, but you have got to remember this, that this is the last opportunity you will get from this Court, you can be assured of that.

		17 December 2015",2015-06-14 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2703264,R v Deborah Grant [2015] NSWSC 759,"Judgment – EX TEMPORE (rEVISED)


	
	The offender appears before me having been issued with a call-up notice pursuant to s 98(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (“the Sentencing Act”). That notice stems from the alleged breach of a bond imposed upon the offender by me on 7 December 2012. The background to the breach can be summarised as follows.
	
	
	On 27 July 2012 the offender pleaded guilty before me to an offence contrary to s 315 of the Crimes Act 1900. That offence carries a maximum penalty of seven years imprisonment. I do not propose, in the circumstances, to canvass the facts of that offending. They are set out in full in my previous judgment: R v Grant [2012] NSWSC 1491 at [6] – [18] inclusive.
	
	
	On 7 December 2012 I sentenced the offender to a fixed term of imprisonment of 12 months commencing on 7 December 2012 and expiring on 6 December 2013. I concluded that the sentence should be wholly suspended, and I immediately released the offender from custody on a bond pursuant to s 12(1)(b) of the Sentencing Act. That bond was subject to a number of conditions. For present purposes only one of those conditions is relevant, namely that which required the offender to be of good behaviour.
	
	
	On 23 November 2013 the offender pleaded guilty before the Casino Local Court to a charge of assault which occurred on 7 October 2013. Although the Bench sheet from the Local Court (which was tendered as part of the Crown material) indicates that the plea was entered on 23 November 2014, that date is clearly incorrect.
	
	
	The facts of the assault are set out in a Statement of Facts which forms part of the Crown bundle. It is appropriate, in the circumstances, that I set them out in full:
	


“The accused, Deborah GRANT, and victim, Dennis GILL, commenced a domestic relationship about 15 years ago. This relationship lasted for several years and came to its demise about nine years ago. This relationship has produced two female children aged 12 and 11 years of age. The accused is associates with Adee BARSHA, the co-accused in the matter.

Around 11.45am on Monday 7th of October 2013, the victim has taken the couples (sic) two children to the accused’s address, 3 Callistemon (sic) in Casino for a visitation. At this time, the co-accused Adee BARSHA was also at the location. Upon arriving at the accused’s address the two children have exited the vehicle and approached the residence. The accused has exited the residence and stood on the verandah yelling abuse at the victim about an incident that happened several weeks ago.

The accused and the victim have engaged in an argument before the victim exited his car and stood on the roadside. The victim has requested the two children get back in the car, the children have complied and got back in the car. The accused has walked up to the victim and grabbed hold of his T-shirt causing the right hand side of it to tear. The accused has then punched the victim to the top of his head with a closed fist. In response the victim has pushed her to her waist forcing her back. This has caused the accused to take several steps back but not fall back.

The victim has then placed himself back in his car and the co accused has exited the house and ran towards the victim whom was still seated in the driver’s seat of his car at this time. The co accused punched the victim to the right hand side of his mouth through the open car window. This has caused the victim to feel pain and caused bleeding to his lips. When the co accused has punched the victim the victim’s upper false teeth have broke (sic) in half.

The victim has left the location in his car to avoid further confrontation.

A short time later the victim has called police. Police have attended 3 Callistemon Place Casino and approached the accused. The accused stated ‘He was in my face so I punched him.’ The victim has attended Casino Police Station at this time and presented with visible injuries. A statement was obtained from the victim and his injuries photographed.

At 1.45 pm on Monday 17th October 2013 the co accused has entered Casino Police Station to express concern about the situation. The co accused was informed he was under arrest for assault and breach of bail conditions. The co accused was cautioned in relation to his right to silence and he indicated he understood.

At 2.55 pm on Monday 7th October 2013 the accused entered Casino Police Station and was advised she was under arrest for assault. The accused was formally cautioned and reminded of her rights.

Whilst the co accused was in police custody he was afforded the opportunity to speak with Aboriginal Legal Aid. The co accused was subsequently advised not to be formally interviewed in relation to the matter. The co accused took this advice and was not interviewed.

The accused was verbally abusive and continued yelling and swearing at police whilst in police custody. As such the accused was not afforded an opportunity to be interviewed.

The co-accused and accused were subsequently charged with the matters that subsequently came before the local court.”


	
	A Pre-sentence Report was prepared in relation to the Local Court proceedings, which forms part of the material which has been tendered before me. Whilst I do not propose to detail the entirety of that report, it records that the offender did not agree with the police facts in their entirety. The report also indicated that in the opinion of the author, the offender showed very little insight into her offending behaviour, and sought to minimise and justify her actions.
	
	
	Following the issue of the call-up notice, the matter came before me on 23 May 2014. On that occasion the offender did not appear although she was legally represented. I was informed on that occasion that she had only just received the call-up notice and was seeking Legal Aid. Since that time, the matter has followed something of a long and tortuous path before me, which I shall briefly outline.
	
	
	After the matter was before me on 23 May 2014, it was next before me on 30 May 2014, at which time the offender appeared and was represented. It was then adjourned for hearing until 17 June 2014.
	
	
	On 17 June 2014 Mr Ozen of counsel appeared on behalf of the offender. He called the offender to give evidence, in the course of which she asserted, in effect, that although she had pleaded guilty before the Local Court to the assault she was in fact not guilty of that offence. The transcript of proceedings on that day reflects the fact that the Crown ceased his cross-examination of the offender, principally because of a fear that if he did not do so, the offender’s position might be prejudiced. As a consequence of what occurred on that occasion, I adjourned the proceedings so as to allow the offender to obtain legal advice in relation to her position.
	
	
	The matter then came back before me on six subsequent occasions between 14 July 2014 and 30 March 2015. Within that period, and specifically on 20 August 2014, the offender made an application in the Local Court that she be granted leave to withdraw the plea of guilty that she had previously entered to the charge of assault. That application was refused by the Magistrate. The offender then made an application to this Court for judicial review of the Magistrate’s decision. Those proceedings were dismissed by Johnson J on 2 April 2015: Grant v The Local Court of New South Wales & Anor [2015] NSWSC 356.
	
	
	Those issues having been determined, the matter comes before me today to determine what action should be taken in relation to the offender’s breach of her bond. I have spent some time setting out the history of the matter so as to explain what might otherwise appear to be an inordinate and unjustifiable delay in the matter being resolved. I make it clear that I do not ascribe any blame for that history to any party. In particular, I make it clear that I ascribe no blame to the offender. She was, in all of the circumstances, entitled to take the course that she took, notwithstanding that it was ultimately unsuccessful.
	
	
	The Crown has previously tendered a bundle of documents containing (inter alia) the factual material relating to the assault as well as some relevant authorities. There is also a Pre-sentence report before me dated 11 June 2015 along with three other documents pertaining to the offender’s children, namely two reports of Dr Christopher Ingall and one of Dr Kate Davies. Those reports detail the various medical conditions from which two of the offender’s children suffer.
	
	
	The offender’s appearance before me arises by virtue of the operation of s. 98 of the Sentencing Act which provides as follows:
	


98 Proceedings for breach of good behaviour bond

(1) If it suspects that an offender may have failed to comply with any of the conditions of a good behaviour bond:

(a) the court with which the offender has entered into the bond, or

(b) any other court of like jurisdiction, or

(c) with the offender’s consent, any other court of superior jurisdiction,

may call on the offender to appear before it.

(1A) If the offender fails to appear, the court may:

(a) issue a warrant for the offender’s arrest, or

(b) authorise an authorised officer to issue a warrant for the offender’s arrest.

(1B) If, however, at the time the court proposes to call on an offender to appear before it, the court is satisfied that the location of the offender is unknown, the court may immediately:

(a) issue a warrant for the offender’s arrest, or

(b) authorise an authorised officer to issue a warrant for the offender’s arrest.

(1C) For the purposes of subsection (1) (c), a court is of superior jurisdiction to the court with which an offender has entered into a good behaviour bond if it is a court to which the offender has (or has had) a right of appeal with respect to the conviction or sentence from which the bond arises.

(2) If it is satisfied that an offender appearing before it has failed to comply with any of the conditions of a good behaviour bond, a court:

(a) may decide to take no action with respect to the failure to comply, or

(b) may vary the conditions of the bond or impose further conditions on the bond, or

(c) may revoke the bond.

(3) In the case of a good behaviour bond referred to in section 12, a court must revoke the bond unless it is satisfied:

(a) that the offender’s failure to comply with the conditions of the bond was trivial in nature, or

(b) that there are good reasons for excusing the offender’s failure to comply with the conditions of the bond.


	
	In Director of Public Prosecutions v Cooke & Anor [2007] NSWCA 2; (2007) 168 A Crim R 379, Howie J made a number of observations about those provisions which are relevant for present purposes.
	
	
	Firstly, his Honour noted (at [14]):
	


“... what the court is required to consider is whether there are good reasons to excuse the failure to comply with the conditions of the bond in circumstances where that failure is not trivial in nature. The focus must principally be upon the behaviour giving rise to the failure to comply with the conditions of the bond and whether that behaviour should be excused.”


	
	Secondly, his Honour observed (at [16]) that if there are extenuating circumstances of sufficient importance to explain the behaviour giving rise to the breach, it is open to the court to exercise its jurisdiction to take no action.
	
	
	Thirdly, his Honour observed (at [17]) that there was a “live issue” regarding the extent (if any) to which the Court “can have regard to matters other than the behaviour giving rise to the breach in determining whether to excuse the breach, such as the impact upon the offender of the consequences of the breach.”
	
	
	Fourthly, his Honour observed (at [24]) that the suspension of a sentence of imprisonment was properly categorised as an act of mercy designed to assist an offender’s rehabilitation, or to benefit the offender for some other purpose, on the understanding that if the offender did not fulfil the conditions of the bond the sentence would be imposed. His Honour observed that in these circumstances, and generally speaking, there can be no unfairness in requiring the offender to serve the sentence when the obligations under the bond have been breached.
	
	
	Having made reference to the importance of recognising that there are two distinct discretions being exercised in circumstances such as these, his Honour finally observed (at [28]):
	


“It is clearly preferable that, wherever possible, the one court should consider both the breach and the sentence for the offence causing the breach;...”


	
	I referred a moment ago to the reference by Howie J to what he described as the “live issue” concerning the extent to which a court can have regard to matters other than the behaviour giving rise to the breach in determining whether to excuse it. In the course of making that observation his Honour made reference to an earlier decision of Hidden J in Director of Public Prosecutions v Burrow [2004] NSWSC 433. In that case, Hidden J observed (at [25]) that where an offence is relatively minor, it might be appropriate to weigh its gravity against the consequences of revocation of the bond, particularly when the suspended sentence is a long one. His Honour went on to observe (at [26]) that an assessment of the seriousness of the offence constituting the breach may require that regard be had to the offender’s subjective circumstances. However, his Honour expressed the view that provisions of s 93(3)(b) of the Sentencing Act did not excuse the breach only by reason of such subjective circumstances. His Honour also stated that it was not open to the Court to have regard to the severity of the penalty to be imposed for the fresh offence.
	
	
	In Cooke Howie J also referred to the observations of King CJ and Perry J in R v Marston (1993) 60 SASR 320. At [21] his Honour observed that two matters should be emphasised arising from the decision in Marston:
	


“...firstly, the determination under s 98(3)(b) should be made bearing firmly in mind that generally a breach of the conditions of the bond will result in the offender serving the sentence that was suspended and, secondly, the principal consideration, if not the only one, is upon the conduct giving rise to the breach.”


	
	Counsel for the offender did not suggest that the offender’s failure to comply with the conditions of the bond was trivial in nature. However, he submitted that there were good reasons for excusing it. He submitted that the offence of assault was committed by the offender in “unusual circumstances”, in which the catalyst for the offending was the offender’s concern for her children. It was submitted that the offending constituted a reaction on the part of a person who was simply “not thinking” at the time.
	
	
	It was submitted by counsel for the offender that the evidence established that the offender has been responding well to treatment, and that her use of illicit drugs had been reduced. It was further submitted that but for the assault which gives rise to the breach of the bond, the offender’s response to treatment had been generally positive.
	
	
	In all of the circumstances, counsel described the offending which constituted the breach of the bond as a “one off”. Counsel also addressed me in relation to the medical issues impacting upon the offender’s children, to which I have already made passing reference. He submitted that the medical evidence which was before me established that the offender’s children were in need of continuing and ongoing assistance at a significant level. He submitted that, in all of these circumstances, the breach was explained.
	
	
	Ultimately, in the event that I was to come to the view that there were no good reasons for excusing the offender’s failure to comply with the conditions of her bond, and if I concluded that a sentence of imprisonment was appropriate, counsel submitted that I ought refer the offender for an assessment as to whether or not any such sentence could be served by way of home detention.
	
	
	In short, the Crown submitted that there were no good reasons to excuse the breach of the bond. In advancing that submission, the Crown took me to various aspects of the facts of the offending which I have outlined, as well as to various aspects of the Pre-sentence Report, which was provided at the time of offending. However, given what was submitted to be the unusual circumstances surrounding this matter, the fact that there had been no further offending, and the circumstances impacting upon the offender’s children, the Crown submitted that a sentence of imprisonment to be served by way of home detention was one which was within the proper range of sentencing discretion.
	
	
	I have outlined the facts of the assault. On any view, that offending was serious. Whilst one can, to some extent, be sympathetic to the offender’s concern for her children, such concern, even when taken at its highest, does not constitute good reasons for excusing her failure to comply with the conditions of the bond. In these circumstances, and having regard to the provisions of s 98(3)(b) of the Sentencing Act, I must revoke the bond.
	
	
	I have already made reference to the various observations of Howie J in Cooke. In particular, I have made reference to his Honour’s observations as to the reasons for which a suspended sentence is generally imposed, and to his reference to the existence of an understanding that if an offender does not fulfil the conditions of a bond the sentence which was suspended ought be imposed. In my view, those observations are particularly apt in the circumstances of the present case. There is no reason, in my view, why a sentence of imprisonment for 12 months ought not be imposed upon the offender. There is, however, another consideration which involves the exercise of a separate discretion, namely how any such sentence should be served.
	
	
	Mr Ozen submitted that if I came to the view that the bond should be revoked and a sentence of imprisonment imposed, I should refer the offender for an assessment as to her suitability for home detention. The Crown did not dissent from that general approach. Candidly, the Crown conceded that if I were to come to the view urged upon me by Mr Ozen, a sentence of imprisonment to be served by way of home detention would be within the bounds of an appropriate exercise of my sentencing discretion.
	
	
	There are factors at play in this case which are significant and which bear directly on the exercise of my discretion. At the forefront of those factors are the matters which impact on the health of the offender’s two young children. It is not necessary for me to recount in detail the circumstances of those children or the illnesses from which they suffer. Those matters are set out in full in the medical evidence to which I have already made some brief reference. They are significant. The children require not only medical attention, but attention and supervision by the offender in her capacity as their mother. It is largely that factor which has led me to conclude that I should exercise my discretion to order that the sentence that I have determined is appropriately served by way of home detention, subject to the offender being assessed as suitable. That will require a further adjournment of the proceedings, so as to permit the offender to undergo an assessment as to her suitability. I am told that such assessments take some weeks and the period of the adjournment will be determined accordingly.
	
	
	For those reasons, I make the following orders:
	



	
	The bond imposed upon the offender pursuant to s 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 on 7 December 2012 is revoked.
	
	
	Pursuant to s 80 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 I refer the offender for an assessment as to her suitability to serve the sentence that I have deemed is appropriate by way of home detention.
	



	
	The offender is granted bail subject to the following conditions:
	



	
	To be of good behaviour;
	
	
	To reside at ****************; and,
	
	
	To make contact with the Probation and Parole Service at Murwillumbah regarding the assessment for home detention within 72 hours of today.
	



	
	I make a further order that the report in relation to the offender’s suitability for home detention be provided to my Associate no later than 22 July 2015.

	SIMPSON J: I have read in draft the judgment of Rothman J. I agree that the Crown appeal ought to be dismissed. I wish to add the following observations to those made by his Honour.
	
	
	Before doing so, it is convenient to state briefly the nature of the offending which the respondent, by his pleas of guilty, admitted. The respondent was charged with four offences, one of which was of aggravated indecent assault on a child under 16 years of age, and three of which were of attempted sexual intercourse with a child under 10 years of age. The offences were committed against two victims, sisters, who were the respondent’s granddaughters. Although it has not been possible to specify with precision the dates of the offences, it seems that they were committed over a period of, at most, a little over one year. The chronology appears to be as follows.
	
	
	The first offence in time (Count 3 on the indictment) was committed at some time in January 2011 at the respondent’s home. The victim (“K”) was then 4 years of age. The respondent was alone with K and her (male) cousin (“N”), then 7 years of age, a grandson of the respondent. The respondent took down the clothing of both children, took N’s penis, and manipulated it an attempt to insert it into K’s vagina. N pulled away, and no penetration was effected. This gave rise to a count of attempted sexual intercourse with a child under 10 years of age, for which, by s 66B of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 25 years is prescribed.
	
	
	The second offence in time (Count 1) was committed at some time between March 2011 and February 2012, also at the respondent’s home. The victim (“G”) was then 3 years of age. After bathing G, and while drying her with a bath towel, the respondent used his fingers to tickle her on the outside of her vagina. This gave rise to the charge of aggravated indecent assault on a child under 16 years of age, for which a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 10 years is prescribed (Crimes Act, s 61M(2)); pursuant to Pt 4 Div 1A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) (“the Sentencing Procedure Act”), a standard non-parole period of 8 years is prescribed.
	
	
	The third offence in time (Count 4) was committed on or about 30 May 2011, which was K’s 5th birthday. The respondent was alone with K at his home. He exposed his penis, and asked K to open her mouth. She did so. The respondent placed his penis on the outside of K’s lips. K closed her mouth, preventing entry of the penis. This gave rise to another count of attempted sexual intercourse with a child under 10 years of age.
	
	
	The fourth offence in time (Count 2) was committed in February 2012. The respondent was with G, then aged 4 years and 11 months, in a shed at his home. The respondent exposed his penis and asked G to open her mouth. G did so. The respondent placed his penis on the outside of her lips. G closed her mouth, preventing entry. This also gave rise to a count of attempted sexual intercourse with a child under 10 years of age.
	
	
	The respondent was charged with the offences on 5 March 2012 and was granted bail. He entered pleas of guilty in the District Court at Albury on 8 April 2014. Sentencing hearings took place on 11 August and 18 August 2014, and the respondent was sentenced on the final day, to an aggregate term of imprisonment for 3 years and 4 months commencing on 18 August 2014, with a non-parole period of 1 year and 8 months.
	


The respondent’s personal circumstances


	
	At the sentencing hearing, a substantial volume of evidence concerning the respondent’s personal circumstances was presented. It was an unusual, but powerful, case.
	
	
	The respondent was born in June 1950 and was 60 years of age at the earliest date specified in the indictment, 61 at the latest (64 at sentencing). He had a variety of health issues, including asthma, back pain, and hypertension. He had a long work history in the telecommunications industry, from which he retired as a self-funded retiree. He had a long list of community involvements. He had no criminal record.
	
	
	It was his family circumstances that took this case out of the ordinary. The respondent was the principal carer for his wife, who has, for 30 years, suffered epilepsy, as well as longstanding depression. Her mental state deteriorated after the respondent’s arrest. The family general practitioner, who provided a report for sentencing purposes, observed that the respondent attended medical appointments with his wife, and dominated the consultation, and that the respondent indicated that he managed the majority of the household duties.
	
	
	In addition, the respondent and his wife are carers for a son, born in 1980, who has recently been diagnosed as suffering from autism, anxiety and depression. A psychological report gave a great deal of detail about the circumstances of his life, his behaviour, and his needs, which I do not propose to repeat. It is sufficient to say that the report clearly indicates that this son places an extraordinarily heavy burden upon his carers, and that, by reason of his mother’s disability, that burden falls primarily upon the respondent.
	
	
	One of the respondent’s sons (the father of N) gave evidence in the sentencing proceedings. He described the respondent (apart from the matters that brought him before the court) as an “otherwise impeccable, amazing character”, who had been “the most wonderful father, most amazing person … the most helpful, generous person I know”. He described the circumstances of the offending as “an anomaly of character” and:
	


“… so out of character that … has made it all the more difficult for the people around him to really accept or even understand how these sort of things occur.”


	
	He gave evidence of the impact on the family of the offending, but said that he was prepared, on the respondent’s release, to assist with his continued rehabilitation.
	
	
	He said that the respondent had been seeing a psychologist on a fairly regular basis, although that appears to have commenced only about 2 months before the sentencing hearing.
	


The Remarks on Sentence


	
	Blackmore DCJ recounted the facts of the offences from a statement of Agreed Facts. He made the following observations:
	



	
	The offences were committed against two separate complainants, aged 3 and 5 respectively. The ages of the children was “an especially high aggravating factor”.
	
	
	That the offences were committed on four separate and distinct occasions meant that “separate and distinct sentences” were called for.
	
	
	It was necessary to take into the account the totality of the offending.
	
	
	It was necessary to give clear recognition to the serious wrongdoing involved in each offence, and each offence should have “an identifiable period in custody”.
	
	
	The offences themselves, while serious, lay at “the lower end of seriousness” when measured against other offences of their kind.
	
	
	By reason of the respondent’s relationship with the victims, each offence involved a breach of trust (this was an aggravating factor).
	
	
	The respondent has no previous criminal record, and had assisted community organisations over the years. His good character entitled him to some mitigation of sentence.
	
	
	The respondent has substantial obligations as caregiver to his wife and autistic son; his absence from the home and consequent inability to discharge his obligations would render his time in custody more difficult.
	
	
	The respondent himself has some serious medical conditions and it was likely that he would, in custody, suffer constant physical pain.
	
	
	The respondent was remorseful (although somewhat belatedly); this was a positive step towards rehabilitation, the prospects of which were “very good”.
	



	
	With reference to the effect on the victims, his Honour said:
	


“There is no suggestion that the victims were physically injured in any way. Given their age it is difficult to speculate on what psychological damage the Offender’s actions may have had. Hopefully exposure of his actions and his plea of guilty will ameliorate at least to some extent, any long term psychological damage.

Given the Offender is their grandfather, who previously had been held in very high regard by his own children, and, no doubt, by his grandchildren, revelation of this offending can be excepted to have significant ramifications for the whole of the family. That will inevitably be felt by the grandchildren themselves and they may need further counselling to deal with those effects.”


	
	His Honour then referred to the respondent’s pleas of guilty. He said that, had the respondent been convicted after trial, then a sentence of “at least 4 years imprisonment” would have been imposed. He then stated his intention of allowing a reduction of 15 per cent attributable to the respondent’s pleas of guilty: R v Thomson; R v Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309; 49 NSWLR 383.
	
	
	He found that there were special circumstances within s 44(2) of the Sentencing Procedure Act that justified departure from the statutory proportions between the non-parole period and the head sentence. The reasons were the health of the respondent, of his wife, and of their autistic son.
	
	
	He then stated his intention of imposing an aggregate sentence pursuant to s 53A of the Sentencing Procedure Act. In compliance with s 53A(2)(b) he indicated the sentences he would have imposed in respect of each offence. These were:
	


Aggravated indecent assault - imprisonment for 18 months with a non-parole period of 9 months;

In respect of each charge of attempted sexual intercourse with a child under 10 years of age - imprisonment for 18 months (he did not specify a non-parole period in respect of any of these offences). He did, however, say that the sentences would be partially concurrent. He then proceeded to impose the aggregate sentence of imprisonment for 3 years and 4 months, with a non-parole period of 1 year and 8 months, commencing on 18 August 2014.

The Crown appeal


	
	The single ground of the Crown appeal is that the aggregate sentence imposed was manifestly inadequate. As is well known, that is an assertion that the sentence was “unreasonable or plainly unjust”: Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at [25].
	
	
	On behalf of the Crown it was argued that there were indicators of error of principle in the Remarks on Sentence.
	
	
	The first was (somewhat confusingly) that his Honour failed to implement his stated intention to reduce the sentences by 15 per cent by reason of the respondent’s pleas of guilty. This inference was drawn because of the “round numbers” of the sentence imposed, and the indicative sentences. It was argued that, had the intended reduction been implemented, the inadequacy of the sentence his Honour proposed to impose would have been exposed.
	
	
	This cannot be accepted. His Honour clearly stated that the starting point was a sentence of imprisonment for 4 years. Reduction of that sentence by 15 per cent yields a little under 3 years and 6 months. The sentence imposed was 3 years and 4 months, conforming precisely (subject to rounding) with his Honour’s stated intention.
	
	
	The second point made on behalf of the Crown was that the indicative sentences in respect of all offences were the same - imprisonment for 18 months, and that this did not adequately reflect the variations in the “degree of culpability”, particularly with respect to the attempted penetration of G’s mouth, the repeated nature of the offending against K, and the involvement of N in Count 3.
	
	
	There is some force in the argument that the indicative sentences did not reflect the variation in the offences. However, the question for present determination is whether the resultant aggregate sentence was, or was not, manifestly inadequate. Indicative sentences are required for the purpose of ensuring that proper attention is paid to the individual circumstances of each offence. Nevertheless, as I have said, the ultimate question is directed to the aggregate sentence imposed.
	
	
	The third asserted error of principle concerned his Honour’s treatment of any psychological damage that may have been suffered by the victims, or either of them.
	
	
	In my opinion, his Honour’s treatment of this was correct. There was no evidence of psychological damage, and, very likely, there could have been none, given the ages of the victims, and the relative recency of the offences. It is true that, in recent times, there has been virtually an assumption of psychological damage resulting from childhood sexual abuse contact: R v Muldoon (NSWCCA, 13 December 1990, unreported), with R v MJB [2014] NSWCCA 195, per Adamson J. However, significant damage is an aggravating factor under s 21A(2)(g) of the Sentencing Procedure Act, and must be proved beyond reasonable doubt. His Honour’s treatment of this issue demonstrated a proper appreciation of the common consequences of sexual offences against children, and a recognition that specific harm could not be taken into account as an aggravating factor, unless proved beyond reasonable doubt.
	
	
	The final error asserted was failure adequately to accumulate the indicative sentences to result in an adequate aggregate sentence.
	
	
	I would reject this proposition also. It is no more than an assertion, in another guise, that the aggregate sentence was manifestly inadequate.
	
	
	This was an unusual case, made so by reason of the personal circumstances of the respondent. It is also to be borne in mind, notwithstanding that the offences were serious, that his Honour considered them to be at the lower end of the range of offences of their kind.
	
	
	In my opinion, no issue of sentencing principle arises in this appeal. The sentence has not been shown to be manifestly inadequate, having regard to all of the circumstances.
	
	
	For these reasons I agree with Rothman J that the Crown appeal ought to be dismissed.
	
	
	ROTHMAN J: On 18 September 2014, the Director of Public Prosecutions, on behalf of the Crown, appealed against the sentence imposed upon the respondent, NFT, by Blackmore DCJ in the District Court in Albury on 18 August 2014.
	
	
	The respondent pleaded guilty to four offences, comprising one count of aggravated indecent assault on a child under 16 years of age, contrary to s 61M(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), and three counts of attempted sexual intercourse with a child under 10 years of age, contrary to s 66B of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). The aggravated indecent assault offence carries a maximum sentence of 10 years’ imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of 8 years’ imprisonment, while the attempted sexual intercourse offences each carry a maximum sentence of 25 years’ imprisonment, the same sentence as is applicable to the completed offence of sexual intercourse with a child of such age (see also s 344A of the Crimes Act 1990 (NSW) which implements the same principle more generally).
	
	
	In determining this appeal, it is necessary to deal with the facts which gave rise to the offences; the Remarks on Sentence that are the subject of the appeal; the principles to be applied in a Crown appeal against sentence; the errors, if any, in the sentencing process; and, in the event that an error is found, whether the Court should exercise its residual discretion to dismiss the appeal, and, if not, the degree to which a more severe sentence is warranted in law.
	
	
	Because of the victims’ ages and relationship between the victims and offender, the legislation requires that the names of the victims and of the respondent be supressed.
	


Facts


	
	The sentence hearing proceeded on the basis of agreed facts, prepared by the Crown Prosecutor, and his Honour recited those facts in his sentencing judgment. The facts so recited are as follows:
	


“The Offender…is the maternal grandfather of both of the victims.

Count 1, between 11 March 2011 and 20 February 2012 in [Albury] whilst at the Offender’s residence the Offender was bathing the victim GBT in the bathroom. Whilst the Offender was drying the victim with a towel the Offender used his fingers to tickle the victim on the outside of her vagina.

Count 2, in relation to the same complainant; between 1 February 2012 and 20 February 2012 whilst at the Offender’s residence the Offender and the victim were located in the shed in the backyard. Whilst the Offender was standing in close proximity to the victim the Offender removed his penis from his underwear, exposing his penis to the victim. The Offender asked the victim to open her mouth to which the victim complied. The Offender took his penis in his hand and placed his penis on the outside of the lips of the mouth of the victim. The victim then closed her mouth and prevented the penis from entering her mouth.

Count 3, in relation to a complainant KBT, between 1 January 2011 and 31 Janurary 2011 whilst at the Offender’s residence the Offender was alone with the victim and the victim’s cousin NT in the back shed of the property. NT was approximately seven years of age at the time of the offence. The Offender ha[d] taken down the pants and underwear of the victim and also NT. The Offender took hold of the penis of NT and manipulated NT’s penis in an attempt to insert it into the vagina of the victim. There was no penetration as NT pulled away.

Count 4, on or about 30 May 2011 whilst at the Offender’s residence the Offender was alone with the victim KBT. Whilst the Offender was standing in close proximity to the victim the Offender removed his penis from his underwear exposing his penis to the victim. The Offender asked the victim to open her mouth to which she complied. The Offender took his penis in his hand and placed his penis on the outside of the lips of the mouth of the victim. The victim closed her mouth and prevented the penis from entering her mouth” (Remarks on Sentence, 1-2).


	
	On 18 August 2014, the respondent was sentenced by Blackmore DCJ in the District Court. Pursuant to s 53A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 NSW (hereinafter, “the Act”), the sentencing judge imposed an aggregate sentence of a non-parole period of 1 year and 8 months, with a balance of term of a further 1 year and 8 months. His Honour indicated that the sentences he would have imposed, if sentencing for the offences individually, were:
	


aggravated indecent assault: imprisonment for 18 month, with a non-parole period of nine months;

each offence of attempted sexual intercourse with a child under 10 years of age: imprisonment for 18 months, with no non-parole period specified.


	
	On 18 September 2014, pursuant to s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), the Director of Public Prosecutions appealed, relying upon one ground of appeal, namely, that the sentence was manifestly inadequate.
	


Remarks on Sentence


	
	In his Honour’s Remarks on Sentence, the sentencing judge noted that each offence was separate and distinct, and occurred on separate occasions (ROS, 3). While taking into account the principle of totality, his Honour stated that the respondent’s sentence must reflect that each offence was “seriously wrong” and that the respondent must serve “an identifiable period in custody for each offence” (ROS, 3).
	
	
	In relation to the objective seriousness of the offences, the sentencing judge found that the sexual acts themselves were “towards the lower end of seriousness” when compared with other possible acts, within the description of the relevant offence, that could have been committed (ROS, 3).
	
	
	The sentencing judge noted that at the time of the offences the victims were aged three and five respectively. His Honour accepted the Crown’s submission that the young age of the victims was “an especially high aggravating factor” (ROS, 3). A further aggravating factor taken into account by his Honour was the breach of trust involved in each offence, since the respondent was the grandfather of both victims and since the victims’ parents, as well as the wider community, trusted him to behave correctly with his grandchildren (ROS, 3).
	
	
	The sentencing judge took into account as mitigating factors evidence that the respondent was of prior good character, particularly that he had assisted with numerous community organisations over the years, and that the respondent did not have a prior criminal record (ROS, 4).
	
	
	The sentencing judge also found that a term of imprisonment would weigh more heavily on the respondent as he was the primary caregiver for his wife, who suffered from a range of serious medical conditions, and his son, who had been diagnosed with autism (ROS, 4). His Honour also found that the respondent’s deteriorating back problem would cause him constant pain in custody and also make his period in custody more difficult (ROS, 5).
	
	
	The sentencing judge noted that the victims were not physically injured in any way (ROS, 5). His Honour stated that, given their age, it was difficult to determine the psychological damage suffered by the victims, but hoped that the exposure of the respondent’s actions and his plea of guilty might ameliorate any long term psychological damage (ROS, 5).
	
	
	The sentencing judge also found that the respondent had very good prospects of rehabilitation, particularly as he had expressed remorse for his actions, which his Honour accepted as genuine, and as he had begun psychological counselling in the community (ROS, 5-6). His Honour also noted that the Community Corrections indicated that the respondent was at low risk of re-offending (ROS, 5).
	
	
	The sentencing judge allowed a discount of 15% for the respondent’s pleas of guilty shortly before trial, which had removed the need for the victims to give evidence at the trial (ROS, 6).
	
	
	Finally, the sentencing judge accepted the respondent’s submission that special circumstances existed, thereby requiring a downwards adjustment of the non-parole period, as it was the respondent’s first time in custody and as he would benefit from a longer period on parole to undertake more counselling (ROS, 6).
	


Principles on Crown Appeals against Sentence


	
	The High Court in CMB v Attorney-General (NSW) [2015] HCA 9; (2015) 317 ALR 308, has recently considered the principles upon which Crown appeals against sentence are determined. It is therefore necessary to summarise briefly the principles as they have been reiterated by the High Court.
	
	
	Sentencing judges have a wide discretion in determining an appropriate sentence for an offender: a sentencing judge “should be allowed as much flexibility in sentencing as is consonant with consistency of approach and as accord with the statutory regime under which sentencing is effected”: Johnson v The Queen [2004] HCA 15; (2004) 78 ALJR 616 at [26], cited with approval in Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; (2005) 228 CLR 357 at [25]; Hili v The Queen; Jones v The Queen [2010] HCA 45; (2010) 242 CLR 520 at [58]. An appellate court can only intervene in a sentence when the applicant, be it the offender or the Crown, establishes that the sentencing judgment is affected by an identifiable or manifest error: House v The King [1936] HCA 40; (1936) 55 CLR 499.
	
	
	The Crown’s right of appeal against a sentence is a creature of statute, otherwise unknown to the common law.
	
	
	Even if error in a sentencing judgment were found, there is a residual discretion to dismiss the appeal. In their reasons for judgment in CMB v Attorney-General (NSW) at 316, French CJ and Gageler J held that the discretion is residual in the sense that it does not fall to be considered, unless an error has been established.
	
	
	The reason that an intermediate court of appeal must explicitly consider, even after an error has been established, whether to exercise their discretion to re-sentence an offender, is related to the purpose of Crown appeals. As Barwick CJ held in Griffiths v The Queen [1977] HCA 44; (1977) 137 CLR 293 at 310:
	


“…An appeal by the Attorney-General should be a rarity, brought only to establish some matter of principle and to afford an opportunity for the Court of Criminal Appeal to perorm its proper function in this respect, namely, to lay down principles for the goverence and guidance of courts having the duty of sentencing convicted persons.”


	
	While appeals against sentence initiated by the offender may be concerned with “the correction of error in particular cases”, the High Court has repeatedly affirmed that appeals brought by the Crown are concerned with the clarifying the general principles of sentencing: Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; (2011) 244 CLR 462; Everett v The Queen [1994] HCA 49; (1994) 181 CLR 295; CMB v Attorney-General (NSW). This particular purpose of Crown appeals is the reason why Crown appeals against sentence should be exceptional or a rarity.
	
	
	The residual discretion operates notwithstanding the terms of s 68A of the Crimes (Appeal and Review Act) 2001 (NSW), which provides that an appellate court must not dismiss a prosecution appeal against sentence on the grounds of double jeopardy. In considering its residual discretion, the appeal court cannot decline to exercise its sentencing discretion on the basis that the respondent will be affected by double jepoardy, but may decline to do so on the basis of other considerations: R v JW [2010] NSWCCA 49; (2010) 77 NSWLR 7.
	
	
	It is unnecessary and inappropriate to set out exhaustively, or to define precisely, the many considerations that may inform the appellate court’s exercise of its residual discretion. To provide an understanding of what such considerations may be, it is sufficient to reiterate the following examples from previous judgments: an offender’s success in rehabilitiation; the proximity of the date for eligibilty for parole; the totality principle; delay; parity; fault on the part of the Crown and lack of fault on the part of the offender: see Green & Quinn at [43].
	
	
	In CMB v Attorney-General (NSW), the High Court recently stated that it is the Crown who bears the onus of establishing that the appellate court should not exercise its residual discretion. In doing so, the High Court overturned R v Smith [2007] NSWCCA 100, in which this Court had held that the offender must prove that it should re-exercise its sentencing discretion. As a consequence, the Crown must prove, on the balance of probabilites, that this Court should decline to exercise its discretion not to re-sentence the respondent.
	
	
	Manifest Inadequacy
	
	
	The Crown relies upon one ground of appeal in these proceedings. The Crown submits that the sentence imposed is manifestly inadequate, that is, the aggregate sentence of imprisonment for 1 year and 8 months, with the balance of term being 1 year and 8 months, is unreasonable or plainly unjust: Markarian v The Queen at [25]. The Crown must satisfy this Court that the sentence imposed on the respondent was outside the range of sentences that could have been imposed: Hili v The Queen; Jones v The Queen at [59].
	
	
	In its written submissions, the Crown outlines particulars as to why the sentence imposed on the respondent was manifestly inadequate. The first particular is that, contrary to s 53A(2)(b) of Act, the indicative sentences issued by the sentencing judge had not been reduced by 15%. As stated earlier in these reasons for judgment, his Honour had proposed to reduce the respondent’s sentence by 15% for his plea of guilty. The Crown accepts that such an error, if found, does not invalidate the aggregate sentence ultimately imposed, pursuant to s 53A(5) of the Act. However, in the Crown’s submission, relying on SHR v R [2014] NSWCCA 94 at [35]-[45], this alleged error may still demonstrate an error in the aggregate sentence.
	
	
	In his Honour’s Remarks on Sentence, the sentencing judge stated that the Court would allow a discount of 15% for the respondent’s guilty plea. Shortly afterwards, his Honour issued the indicative sentences for the offence of aggravated indecent assault and the offences of attempted sexual intercourse. The sentencing judge does not explicitly state that these indicative sentences have been determined after taking into account the 15% discount, that is, his Honour does not state that the starting point was 4 years’ imprisonment, which when discounted by 15% is approximately the sentence imposed. Further, his Honour says nothing inconsistent with the foregoing. In such circumstances, I accept the respondent’s submission that there is no basis for a conclusion that the indicative sentences have not been properly determined.
	
	
	Moreover, in SHR v R, Fullerton J, with whom Basten JA and Davies J agreed, emphasised a failure to comply with s 53A(2)(b) of the Act will only be significant when that error is “material to the outcome”. At all times, the key issue is whether the aggregate sentence is “sustainable”: SHR v R at [40]. The Crown has not demonstrated how the aggregate sentence has been affected by the alleged failure to comply with s 53A(2)(b) of the Act.
	
	
	The second particular argued by the Crown in support of manifest inadequacy is that, in determining the indicative sentences, the sentencing judge failed to differentiate between the varying “degrees of culpability” (sic) involved in each offence. The Crown submits that, in relation to the offences involving the victim GBT, the respondent’s conduct in Count 2, namely attempting to penetrate the victim’s lips with his penis, was more culpable than his conduct in Count 1, which involved tickling the outside of the victim’s vagina. Moreover, the Crown argues that the respondent’s culpability was greater in relation to Counts 3 and 4 as those offences involved repeated offending of the same nature against a second victim. The Crown also submits that the respondent’s culpability in relation to Count 3 was greater than that in the other attempted sexual intercourse offences (Counts 2 and 4), due to the nature of the respondent’s conduct and the involvement of a third child.
	
	
	Unlike the error alleged in relation to the first particular, this alleged error concerning the indicative sentences has the capacity to affect the aggregate sentence ultimately imposed on the offender. It is therefore necessary to consider this second particular in detail.
	
	
	It should be noted that the fact that an offender is charged with two different offences (in this case, aggravated indecent assault and attempted sexual intercourse with a child) will not necessarily result in different sentences being imposed for each offence. Nor will the fact that an offender was charged with different counts of the same offence necessarily lead to different sentences. It may be that the level of criminal culpability involved in each offence and/or count was the same and, therefore, the sentences imposed for each will also be the same.
	
	
	In this case, the objective seriousness of each offence was very similar. I agree with the sentencing judge’s finding that the nature of the offender’s conduct was, in each count, “towards the lower end of seriousness” for these types of offences, especially given the nature of the acts themselves and the fact that the offender did not persist when the victims resisted. Ultimately, a sentence of 18 months imprisonment for each count was not outside the range available.
	
	
	It is also important to bear in mind that the sentencing judge in this case, like most sentencing judges, delivered these remarks on sentence ex tempore. In that circumstance, greater licence must be given to the sentencing judge in the wording used or in some aspects of component parts of an ultimate sentence that is otherwise appropriate.
	
	
	The third particular submitted by the Crown is that the sentencing judge queried the psychological damage, or potential psychological damage, suffered by the victims and that his Honour gave little weight to the impact of the respondent’s offending on the victims. The Crown draws the Court’s attention to several cases in which it has been held that child sex offences “inevitably give rise to psychological damage” to the victims: SW v R [2013] NSWCCA 255 at [52]; see also R v Gavel [2014] NSWCCA 56 at [110].
	
	
	It is appropriate to set out the relevant passage of the sentencing judge’s remarks in full:
	


“There is no suggestion that the victims were physically harmed in any way. Given their age it is difficult to speculate on what psychological damage the Offender’s actions may have had. Hopefully exposure of his actions and his plea of guilty will ameliorate at least to some extent, any long term psychological damage.

Given the Offender is their grandfather, who previously had been held in very high regard by his own children, and, no doubt, by his grandchildren, revelation of this offending can be expected to have significant ramifications for the whole family. That will inevitably be felt by the grandchildren themselves and they may need further counselling to deal with those effects.” (ROS, 5)


	
	In my opinion, it is clear that his Honour did not query the psychological impact on the victims. Rather, his Honour emphasised it and noted that while the subsequent conduct of the offender may lessen its effect, because of the familial relationship between the victims and the offender, adverse effects may result. This allegation of error is untenable.
	
	
	The fourth particular is that the sentencing judge’s accumulation of the indicative sentences did not reflect the seriousness of child sexual offences committed on several occasions against young victims under his care and authority. This is another way of submitting that the sentence is outside the range available.
	
	
	As stated above, sentencing judges have a wide discretion in determining an appropriate sentence and given that the Crown has not identified an error in the sentencing judge’s application of the principles of totality or accumulation, nor in the sentencing judge’s consideration of the objective and subjective circumstances of the offences or offender, this Court may not interfere with the sentence imposed on the offender on this basis other than if the sentence is outside the appropriate range. In the particular subjective circumstances of this offender and the objective circumstances of the offences, the sentence, although exceedingly light by ordinary standards, is within range.
	
	
	The fifth and final particular put forward by the Crown in support of manifest inadequacy is that the aggregate sentence imposed by the sentencing judge does not reflect either the maximum penalty for each offence or the standard non-parole period for the Count 1 offence as relevant legislative guideposts.
	
	
	The sentencing judge explicitly noted the maximum penalty of the offences and the standard non-parole period in relation to the offence in Count 1.
	
	
	The ultimate question to be determined is whether the sentence imposed on the offender was outside the range of sentences that could have been imposed. The Crown’s main contention is that, in all the circumstances of the case, particularly “the extremely serious offences of sexual assault” (sic) with which the offender was charged, the young age of the victims and the fact that each count was a “separate instance of serious criminality” (sic), the aggregate sentence of 1 year and 8 months imprisonment, with a further term of 1 year and 8 months, was outside the range available.
	
	
	I am not satisfied the sentence fell outside of the range of sentences that could have been imposed. Other than their bold assertion that the range requires a more severe sentence, the Crown did not present any material to support the assertion of the range, such as statistics or comparable cases.
	
	
	While statistics must be used with care, an assertion of that kind ought be accompanied by some comparative material. As earlier stated, given that the gravity of the offending was towards the lower end of objective culpability and given the nature of the subjective circumstances of the offender, the sentence is not outside the range available and is not manifestly inadequate.
	


Residual Discretion


	
	Regardless of my finding in relation to manifest inadequacy, I am also not satisfied that the Crown has established that the Court should decline to exercise its residual discretion.
	
	
	The Crown submits that given the extent of the manifest inadequacy of the sentence imposed on the offender, the Court would not exercise its residual discretion. In support of its submission, the Crown relies on the joint judgement of French CJ and Gageler J in CMB v Attorney-General (NSW) in which they quoted the majority judgment in Munda v Western Australia [2013] HCA 38; (2013) 249 CLR 600. In the later case, French CJ and Hayne, Crennan, Kiefel, Gageler and Keane JJ held:
	


“[76] …the conclusion that the sentence imposed was manifestly inadequate… was sufficient to justify intervention given that to decline to intervene would have been to perpetuate a manifest injustice.”


	
	The above passage from the majority judgment in Munda v Western Australia suggests that there may be cases in which a decision not to re-sentence an offender whose sentence has been found to be manifestly inadequate would be to perpetuate a manifest injustice. In such situations, as it would appear from the High Court decisions referred to above, the Court may decline to exercise the residual discretion.
	
	
	However, the above passage must be read in its context. In Munda v Western Australia, both the majority at [73] and Bell J in dissent at [90] held that the restriction of the residual discretion by the Supreme Court of Western Australia was incorrect. Their Honours held that McLure P had wrongly stated that “save where parity considerations arise, the residual discretion is only likely to be exercised if the error has not resulted in a manifestly inadequate sentence”. The majority of the High Court affirmed the considerations relevant to the determination of whether to exercise the residual discretion as outlined by the majority in Green & Quinn, which included parity of sentences of co-offenders, delay in the hearing and determination of the appeal, the imminent or past release of the offender on parole and the rehabilitation of the offender in prison: Green & Quinn at [43]; see also the judgment of Bell J in dissent at [131].
	
	
	It is clear from Munda v Western Australia and Green & Quinn, that an appellate court has a wide discretion not to re-sentence an offender in a Crown appeal and that there are many considerations that may be taken into account in determining whether to exercise that discretion. Contrary to the Crown’s submission, the fact that a sentence is manifestly inadequate will not automatically result in the Crown having satisfied the burden that the Court should not exercise their residual discretion.
	
	
	Nevertheless, it is open for an appellate court to re-sentence an offender whose sentence has been held to be manifestly inadequate, despite there not being any identifiable error of sentencing principles to correct: Munda v Western Australia at [76]. This is particularly so if in resentencing, the appellate court is seeking to correct the range that may otherwise be thought to apply. In those circumstances, the appellate court is interfering because not to do so would be to grant its imprimatur to an unjust range of sentences.
	
	
	In these proceedings, it is clear on the evidence before the Court that an extension of the offender’s time in prison would cause great distress on himself and his family. I also note that the offender has made some progress, both during his time on bail and whilst in prison, towards rehabilitation. I therefore find that the Crown has not fulfilled the burden upon it to satisfy the Court to decline to exercise the residual discretion.
	
	
	For the foregoing reasons, I propose that the appeal be dismissed.
	
	
	BELLEW J: I have had the advantage of reading, in draft, the judgment of Rothman J and Simpson J.
	
	
	I agree, for the reasons set out by Rothman J that the Crown appeal should be dismissed. I also agree with the additional observations of Simpson J.

2703284,R v Biljuh (No 3) [2015] NSWSC 710,"EX TEMPORE Judgment


	
	Objection has been taken by defence counsel to photograph 45 of Crown voir dire exhibit J. That photograph is of the deceased's body lying on some kitchen tiles or linoleum. It shows the deceased's face covered by duct tape in a way that was described in the Crown Prosecutor's opening, and in a way that undoubtedly would have led to the suffocation of that elderly lady.
	
	
	Mr Dennis, who appears for the accused, has not objected to photograph 48, which shows a close-up of the deceased's face wrapped in duct tape. Nor has he objected to photograph 61 of voir dire exhibit J, which shows the rear of the deceased's head.
	
	
	Mr Dennis has submitted that photograph 45 is a distressing one, a submission that I accept.
	
	
	There is no dispute between the parties about the nature of the test in s 137 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW). Suffice to say, it is not a question of discretion; rather, I must refuse to admit evidence adduced by the prosecutor if its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the accused.
	
	
	I think that it is possible that photograph 45 could upset the jury. But I think that it is unlikely that it would do so above and beyond the contents of photograph 48 and photograph 61. In short, focusing on the danger of unfair prejudice arising from photograph 45 itself, I think that that is reasonably low.
	
	
	As for the probative value of the evidence, I assess that generally as being quite high. Unless I am mistaken, that is the only photograph that will show the precise location and arrangement of the deceased's body in situ.
	
	
	As well as that, Mr Crown, in support of the application, has explained that the Crown case is that the deceased's body may well have been dragged by the perpetrator. Mr Crown has reminded me that the Crown case is that a DNA profile consistent with that of the accused was found on the collar of the dress worn by the deceased. In short, Mr Crown's submission is that the evidence is not only relevant in a general sense with regard to the location and position of the body, but indeed it is relevant and probative in quite a specific way; namely, with regard to the thesis of dragging, and also the jury's understanding of the location of the DNA profile and its significance.
	
	
	In all of the circumstances, I assess the probative value of the evidence as quite high.
	
	
	To my mind, making the evaluative judgment required by s 137 of the Evidence Act, I do not consider that the probative value of photograph 45 is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the accused that may arise from its admission.
	
	
	Accordingly, photograph 45 of voir dire exhibit J will be admitted into evidence.

2703285,Perilya Limited v Nash [2015] NSWSC 706,"Judgment


	
	These proceedings are brought by way of two Amended Summonses filed 2 April 2015 in this Court pursuant to Part 5 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (the “CAR Act”). They concern two decisions made by her Honour Magistrate Goodwin of the Downing Centre Local Court on 13 August 2014 whereby Perilya Limited, (“the plaintiff”), was found guilty of two offences of failure to comply with Notices to Produce documents under s 155(5) of the Work Health and Safety Act 2011 (NSW) (WHS Act). Magistrate Goodwin imposed a fine of $20,000 in respect of each of the two offences and made a costs order against the company in the sum of $74,281.00.
	
	
	The two Notices to Produce in question were issued under s 155 of the WHS Act. The plaintiff seeks an order setting aside the convictions and also seeks leave to appeal from the sentences imposed by Magistrate Goodwin on 13 October 2014 together with an order remitting the matter to the Local Court for variation of sentence. Finally, the plaintiff also appeals the costs orders made against it by Magistrate Goodwin on 13 October 2014. The terms of the four grounds of appeal relied upon in each of the Amended Summonses are set out at [50] below.
	
	
	The respondent, Jennifer Nash, an appointed investigator and prosecutor acting on behalf of the Department of Trade, Investment, Regional Infrastructure and Services, opposes the summonses and submits that they should be dismissed.
	


Appeals from Local Court to Supreme Court


	
	The present proceedings are brought pursuant to s 52(1) of the CAR Act. In the event that the proceedings do not involve “a question of law alone” as required by that section, the plaintiff’s counsel in opening submissions stated that reliance would be placed on s 53(1) of that Act. The relevant provisions are in the following terms:
	


“52   Appeals as of right

(1)   Any person who has been convicted or sentenced by the Local Court, otherwise than with respect to an environmental offence, may appeal to the Supreme Court against the conviction or sentence, but only on a ground that involves a question of law alone.

…

53   Appeals requiring leave

(1)   Any person who has been convicted or sentenced by the Local Court, otherwise than with respect to an environmental offence, may appeal to the Supreme Court against the conviction or sentence on a ground that involves:

(a)   a question of fact, or

(b)   a question of mixed law and fact,

but only by leave of the Supreme Court.

…”

The Work Health and Safety Act 2011


	
	The WHS Act came into operation on 1 January 2012. Divisions 2-4 of the Act impose duties and obligations upon individuals and businesses in relation to workplace health and safety. The primary duty of care is provided in s 19 of the Act. It is in the following terms:
	


19 Primary duty of care

(1)   A person conducting a business or undertaking must ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, the health and safety of:

(a)   workers engaged, or caused to be engaged by the person, and

(b)   workers whose activities in carrying out work are influenced or directed by the person,

while the workers are at work in the business or undertaking.

(2)   A person conducting a business or undertaking must ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, that the health and safety of other persons is not put at risk from work carried out as part of the conduct of the business or undertaking.

(3)   Without limiting subsections (1) and (2), a person conducting a business or undertaking must ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable:

(a)   the provision and maintenance of a work environment without risks to health and safety, and

(b)   the provision and maintenance of safe plant and structures, and

(c)   the provision and maintenance of safe systems of work, and

(d)   the safe use, handling, and storage of plant, structures and substances, and

(e)   the provision of adequate facilities for the welfare at work of workers in carrying out work for the business or undertaking, including ensuring access to those facilities, and

(f)   the provision of any information, training, instruction or supervision that is necessary to protect all persons from risks to their health and safety arising from work carried out as part of the conduct of the business or undertaking, and

(g)   that the health of workers and the conditions at the workplace are monitored for the purpose of preventing illness or injury of workers arising from the conduct of the business or undertaking.

(4)   If:

(a)   a worker occupies accommodation that is owned by or under the management or control of the person conducting the business or undertaking, and

(b)   the occupancy is necessary for the purposes of the worker’s engagement because other accommodation is not reasonably available,

the person conducting the business or undertaking must, so far as is reasonably practicable, maintain the premises so that the worker occupying the premises is not exposed to risks to health and safety.

(5)   A self-employed person must ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, his or her own health and safety while at work.


	
	Part 2, Division 5 of the Act creates various offences in relation to contraventions of the specified statutory health and safety duties contained in Divisions 2-4 of Part 2.
	
	
	Part 8 of the WHS Act identifies the regulator’s functions and powers. In Part 8, Division 1, the functions of the Regulator are set out in s 152. One is the function “To monitor and enforce compliance with this Act”: s 152(b). The performance of that function would embrace both past contraventions as well as reviewing workplaces and systems in order to mitigate or reduce workplace risks to health and safety.
	
	
	Section 153(1) of the Act provides that, subject to the Act, the regulator has the power to do all things necessary or convenient to be done for or in connection with the performance of its functions. Section 153(2) provides that without limiting s 153(1), the regulator has all the powers and functions that an inspector has under the Act.
	
	
	In Part 8, Division 2, the WHS Act prescribes the powers of the regulator to obtain information. These include coercive powers prescribed by s 155. That section is central to the issues arising in the present proceedings:
	


155 Powers of regulator to obtain information

(1)   This section applies if the regulator has reasonable grounds to believe that a person is capable of giving information, providing documents or giving evidence in relation to a possible contravention of this Act or that will assist the regulator to monitor or enforce compliance with this Act. (emphasis added)

(2)   The regulator may, by written notice served on the person, require the person to do one or more of the following:

(a)   to give the regulator, in writing signed by the person (or in the case of a body corporate, by a competent officer of the body corporate) and within the time and in the manner specified in the notice, that information of which the person has knowledge,

(b)   to produce to the regulator, in accordance with the notice, those documents,

(c)   to appear before a person appointed by the regulator on a day, and at a time and place, specified in the notice (being a day, time and place that are reasonable in the circumstances) and give either orally or in writing that evidence and produce those documents.

(3)   The notice must:

(a)   state that the requirement is made under this section, and

(b)   contain a statement to the effect that a failure to comply with a requirement is an offence, and

(c)   if the notice requires the person to provide information or documents or answer questions:

(i)   contain a statement about the effect of sections 172 and 269, and

(ii)   state that the person may attend with a legal practitioner.

(4)   The regulator must not make a requirement under subsection (2) (c) unless the regulator has taken all reasonable steps to obtain the information under subsections (2) (a) and (b) and has been unable to do so.

(5)   A person must not, without reasonable excuse, refuse or fail to comply with a requirement under this section.

Maximum penalty:

(a)   in the case of an individual—$10,000, or

(b)   in the case of a body corporate—$50,000.

(6)   Subsection (5) places an evidential burden on the accused to show a reasonable excuse.

(7)   Section 172 (with any necessary changes) applies to a requirement under this section.


	
	As discussed below, the WHS Act contains protective provisions. In particularly, s 271 is directed at ensuring confidentiality in relation to information obtained. Section 271 provides:
	


271 Confidentiality of information

(1)   This section applies if a person obtains information or gains access to a document in exercising any power or function under this Act (other than under Part 7).

(2)   The person must not do any of the following:

(a)   disclose to anyone else:

(i)   the information, or

(ii)   the contents of or information contained in the document,

(b)   give access to the document to anyone else,

(c)   use the information or document for any purpose.

Maximum penalty:

(a)   in the case of an individual—$10,000, or

(b)   in the case of a body corporate—$50,000.

(3)   Subsection (2) does not apply to the disclosure of information, or the giving of access to a document or the use of information or a document:

(a)   about a person, with the person’s consent, or

(b)   that is necessary for the exercise of a power or function under this Act, or

(c)   that is made or given by the regulator or a person authorised by the regulator if the regulator reasonably believes the disclosure, access or use:

(i)   is necessary for administering, or monitoring or enforcing compliance with, this Act, or

(ii)   is necessary for the administration or enforcement of another Act prescribed by the regulations, or

(iii)   is necessary for the administration or enforcement of another Act or law, if the disclosure, access or use is necessary to lessen or prevent a serious risk to public health or safety, or

(iv)   is necessary for the recognition of authorisations under a corresponding WHS law, or

(v)   is required for the exercise of a power or function under a corresponding WHS law, or

(d)   that is required by any court, tribunal, authority or person having lawful authority to require the production of documents or the answering of questions, or

(e)   that is required or authorised under a law, or

(f)   to a Minister.

(4)   A person must not intentionally disclose to another person the name of an individual who has made a complaint in relation to that other person unless:

(a)   the disclosure is made with the consent of the complainant, or

(b)   the disclosure is required under a law.

Maximum penalty:

(a)   in the case of an individual—$10,000, or

(b)   in the case of a body corporate—$50,000.

Factual Background


	
	The plaintiff is an Australian company with a registered office in Perth, Western Australia. It is a member of a group of companies (The Perilya Group) that carries on the business of mining operations. The plaintiff is the holding company of Perilya Broken Hill Limited (PBHL) which, at all material times, operated a zinc, lead and silver mine at Broken Hill. On 8 June 2012 a worker employed by PBHL, Mr Pollard, fell approximately 14 metres down a mine shaft at the Broken Hill mine. According to the submissions of both parties he was seriously injured. This was referred to in the proceedings as the 2012 incident or accident.
	
	
	The Department of Trade, Investment, Regional Infrastructure and Services commenced an investigation into the incident. The Department is a “Regulator” for the purposes of s 155 of the WHS Act. During the course of the investigation a large number of notices were issued under s 155 to the plaintiff company and other companies in the Perilya Group of companies. Most of these notices were complied with by the plaintiff and its associated entities.
	
	
	As part of the investigation a number of documents were sought on 22 May 2013. On that date, Mr Smith, an investigator appointed under the Act, issued s 155 Notice, No 130522, (the “May Notice”) which directed production by the plaintiff of the following documents:
	


“a)   Item D – The minutes of the meetings of the Board of Directors which were convened between 24 May 2008 and 30 December 2012; and

b)   Item H – Any reports, memorandums or other documents which were prepared between 24 May 2008 and 30 December 2012, by or at the direction of the company executive or other managers, for the purpose of advising the Board of Directors of matters relating to safety performance at the mine (Respondent’s Outline of Submissions p 2).


	
	Documents within Items D and H were provided in answer to the Notice but they contained a number of redactions.
	
	
	On 20 November 2013 Mr Smith issued to the plaintiff a s 155 Notice, No 131120, (the “November Notice”) which sought production of:
	


“a)   Un-redacted copies of the minutes of the meetings of the Board of Directors of Perilya Limited which were convened between 24 May 2008 and 30 December 2012; and

b)   Un-redacted copies of documents the applicant had produced on 21 June 2013 specifically:

Perilya Group Health and Safety reports;

PBHL Health Safety and Environment reports’ and

PBHL Operations reports

For the period 24 May 2008 and 30 December 2012.” (Respondent’s Outline of Submissions p 3).


	
	Time for compliance with this Notice was extended to 26 November 2013 after a request from the plaintiff’s solicitors.
	
	
	The two categories of documents specified in the November Notice were referred to by both parties in these proceedings as the “disputed documents”.
	
	
	It appears that the inspector sought production of documents from the year 2008 onwards by reason of the fact that certain documents that had been produced in the course of an investigation indicated that there may have been an accident with some similarities to the 2012 accident in the 2008 year.
	
	
	In the Plaintiff’s Outline of Submissions it was stated at [33]:
	


“Mr Smith repeatedly gave evidence that he was seeking information about the 2008 incident for the purpose of identifying any recommendations that were made as a result of that incident, whether and how those recommendations had been implemented, the audit process in place to ensure the proper implementation of those recommendations and the persons with effective control concerning the implementation of those recommendations.”


	
	On 26 November 2013 the plaintiff failed to produce the disputed documents in un‑redacted form. On that date the plaintiff’s solicitor forwarded an email to Mr Smith advising that the material that had been redacted related to commercially sensitive and confidential information. On 27 November 2013 an officer of the Department by email drew the plaintiff’s solicitor attention to the protection afforded by s 271 of the WHS Act. They were also asked to identify the basis for the legal professional privilege claim. Time for compliance was extended until 28 November 2013.
	
	
	By letter dated 28 November 2013 the plaintiff wrote to the Department advising that it considered that it had produced all the documents to which the Department was “entitled as a consequence of the proper exercise of the power conferred on you by s 155…”: Respondent’s Outline of Submissions at [13].
	
	
	The plaintiff’s solicitor also informed the Department that legal professional privilege was claimed over some of the documents and that other parts of documents were commercially sensitive and that the latter had been redacted for that reason. It was asserted that the redacted information did not pertain to governance of safety.
	
	
	On 19 December 2013 Mr Smith issued the applicant with a further s 155 Notice, No 131219, (the “December Notice”) which again required production of the disputed documents. Again, the plaintiff declined to produce the documents relying in subsequent correspondence upon the relevance of the documents, the commercially sensitive nature of some material contained within the documents and the scope of the power under s 155.
	
	
	By Court Attendance Notices filed on 10 January 2014, the plaintiff was charged with two counts of failing to comply with a notice issued under s 155 WHS Act in relation to the November and December Notices, in particular, by its failure to produce the disputed documents. The plaintiff entered not guilty pleas. A hearing of the charges took place before Magistrate Goodwin at the Downing Centre Local Court on 16-17 June 2014. As noted above, on 13 August 2014 the plaintiff company was found guilty of the offences charged. On 13 October 2014 it was ordered to pay a fine of $20 000 in respect of each offence. Magistrate Goodwin made a costs order against the applicant in the sum of $74 281.00.
	


The Magistrate’s Decision


	
	In the course of the Magistrate’s decision a number of factual findings were made by her Honour. These were summarised in the Respondent’s Outline of Submissions at [20] as follows:
	


(a)   The Director-General of the Department of Trade, Investment Regional Infrastructure and Services is the regulator in relation to matters or the exercise of a power or function under the WHS Act concerning a mining workplace and had delegated functions pursuant to s 154 of the WHS Act to the Director, Mine Safety performance;

(b)   The respondent is a duly appointed director of Mine Safety Performance and is appointed as an investigator pursuant to s 127(1)(d) of the MHS Act [Mine Health and Safety Act 2004] and was entitled to commence prosecutions under the WHS Act;

(c)   Inspector Smith was appointed as an investigator under s 127 of the MHS Act and is a mine health and safety inspector for the purposes of the WHS Act pursuant to s 156A of the WHS Act;

(d)   Inspector Smith commenced an investigation of the 2012 Incident on behalf of the regulator and formed a belief that the applicant was capable of exercising control and influence of the Mine;

(e)   Inspector Smith considered that there were reasonable grounds to believe that the minutes of the meeting of the Board of Directors of the applicant from 24 May 2008 until December 2012 might provide material relevant to a possible contravention of the WHS Act or assist in the monitoring or enforcement of compliance with the WHS Act. In particular:

(i)   Inspector Smith believed the documents sought were relevant to the 2012 Incident because the documents related to matters such as decision making and control over work at the Mine and he wanted to determine what control, if any, the Board of Directors of the applicant exercised over the Mine in 2008 and what was done, if anything as a result of the 2008 Incident;

(ii)   Inspector Smith wished to investigate what, if any, relationship there was between the 2008 Incident and the 2012 Incident and what the applicant had done following the 2008 Incident that might be relevant to the 2012 Incident; and

(iii)   Inspector Smith believed the documents could reveal whether any recommendation made following the 2008 Incident was the subject of a direction or action by the applicant prior to the 2012 Incident, which he believed was relevant to his investigation as to whether the applicant had complied with the duties in ss 19 and 27 of the WHS Act.

(f)   Inspector Smith’s process of reasoning (as summarised immediately above) is capable of satisfying the reasonable grounds required in s 155 of the WHS Act.

(g)   Inspector Smith issued to the applicant a s 155 WHS Act notice seeking production of documents he believed would assist in the investigation (the May Notice);

(h)   Inspector Smith received heavily redacted copies of the documents in response to the May Notice;

(i)   Inspector Smith had reasonable grounds to believe that the applicant was capable of providing the Disputed Documents and that the provision of those documents might relate to a possible contravention of the WHS Act or might assist the Regulator to monitor or enforce compliance with the WHS Act.

(j)   Inspector Smith issued the November Notice and the December Notice to obtain the Disputed Documents;

(k)   The November Notice and the December Notice were properly issued;

(l)   The applicant received the November Notice and the December Notice;

(m)   There was a large volume of correspondence between Inspector Smith and the legal representatives of the applicant concerning the production of the Disputed Documents. In particular:

(i)   The legal representatives for the applicant asserted that part of the redacted material contained information that was commercially sensitive and material over which it claimed legal professional privilege;

(ii)   Inspector Smith pointed out that the WHS Act contained provisions to safeguard the material from release (s 271);

(n)   No unredacted material was provided (in response to either the November 2013 Notice or the December 2013 Notice);

(o)   No unredacted material was provided to the Court such that there was no evidence before the Court that allowed an assessment of the claims raised by the applicant’s legal representatives in correspondence that the redacted material contains material that is commercially sensitive or is the subject of legal professional privilege; and

(p)   The applicant did not provide a reasonable excuse for not supplying the Dispute Documents.”


	
	There was no dispute, nor could there have been any, but that the plaintiff company is subject to obligations imposed under the WHS Act in respect of the mining operations of PBHL concerning its mine at Broken Hill in New South Wales. Nor is there any dispute that PBHL is similarly subject to the provisions of that Act.
	


Mine Accidents at the Broken Hill Mine


	
	The accident involving Mr Mark Pollard was the subject of evidence of Mr Smith before the Magistrate on 16 June 2014. The transcript of his evidence was provided to this Court and is contained in Court Book, Vol 1, at pp 105‑184.
	
	
	A copy of a statement of Mr Smith dated 14 June 2014 became Exhibit 1 in the proceedings, and is contained in Court Book, Vol 2, at pp 311-671.
	
	
	Mr Smith stated that on 8 June 2012 the Regulator received a “Mine Notification of Incident Form” in relation to the Southern Operations Mine operated by PBHL. The form stated that Mr Pollard, a worker at the Mine, had fallen 14m down a shaft. As a result Mr Pollard suffered serious injuries including the traumatic amputation of his right leg below the hip, three spinal fractures, seven broken ribs, a lacerated liver, cuts and abrasions: Statement of Antony Smith at [6].
	
	
	On or about 8 June 2012 the Regulator commenced an investigation into the incident. Mr Smith was a member of a team that conducted the investigation and acted in the investigation for the Regulator.
	
	
	The Registered Office of PBHL at the time of the 2012 accident was an address in Perth, Western Australia. One share issued by PBHL was held by the holding company, Perilya Limited: Statement of Antony Smith at [10].
	
	
	Mr Smith stated that he received a letter from the solicitor representing Perilya Limited and PBHL. The letter was dated 5 December 2012 and it stated that it was responding to a notice that had been issued. Various documents were provided including a document entitled “Perilya Limited HSE Management System Overview” in response to the notice. Mr Smith reviewed the information and documents produced and said that he noted that the overview (referred to as the HSE Overview):
	


“(a)   bears the title ‘Perilya Limited HSE Management System’; and

(b)   that the Perilya Board has a defined role in the management of safety at the Mine.” (Statement of Antony Smith at [12])


	
	Mr Smith also noted that the document “Quarterly Activities Report for the three months ended 30 June 2012” which bore the logo of “Perilya”, at page 14 stated:
	


“ ‘Perilya…owns and operates” the iconic Broken Hill zinc, lead, silver mine in NSW Australia and… the Cerro de Maimon copper, gold and silver mine in the Dominican Republic.” (Statement of Antony Smith at [14])


	
	Mr Smith obtained a document produced on behalf of the plaintiff entitled “Board Charter”. The Charter stated, amongst other things, that the Board had responsibilities for workplace safety: Statement of Antony Smith at [15].
	
	
	Mr Smith stated in his written statement at [20] that based upon the contents of the particular documents to which he referred he had formed a view that:
	


“(a)   Perilya Limited exercised, or was capable of exercising, control and influence over PBHL and the Mine at all material times including on 8 June 2012 …”; and

“(b)   The minutes of meetings of the Board of Directors of Perilya Limited, and other documents provided to them would assist the Regulator to monitor or enforce compliance with the WHS Act.”


	
	Mr Smith’s statement then addressed the issue of the May Notice (Statement of Antony Smith at [21]-[40]) and the December Notice (Statement of Antony Smith at [41]-[47]).
	
	
	Mr Smith was cross-examined during the hearing on 16 June 2014. In the course of the cross-examination, he was questioned about information that had been sought in one of the Notices concerning the 2008 incident: T 30-35, 16 June 2014. Mr Smith stated that there was an issue as to the identification of persons who were in control and involved in decision-making for PCPU subsequent to the accident that occurred on 24 May 2008:
	


“… which would have likely have had an effect on the safety operations of the Mine as on 8 June 2012, which was the date of the Pollard incident. So it was relevant to that time period.” (T 31:10-20)


	
	Mr Smith’s evidence indicated that the accident in 2008 at the Mine involved a large counterweight falling down a mine shaft. He said that recommendations given following that particular incident “… may require significant changes in safety management systems and – and financial resources to undertake to ensure that similar incidents don’t occur again …”: T 30:15-25.
	
	
	Mr Smith, also in cross-examination, stated that the accident on 24 May 2008 was a “significant incident”. He added:
	


“… my point of view was that this was a serious event and that significant review, recommendations, auditing, would have taken place after that date and prior to the Pollard incident.” (T 31:10-20)


	
	Importantly, Mr Smith, for the Regulator was found by the learned Magistrate to have formed the necessary belief under s 155 of the WHS Act.
	


The Notices Issued by the Regulator


	
	Copies of the Notices issued by Mr Smith under s 155 were included in the Court Book, Vol 2 at p 636 and 662.
	
	
	They were in what appears to be a standard format to which particulars of documents to be produced were specified. Each Notice was addressed to the plaintiff company. The “Grounds” for issue stated in the Notices were:
	


“Serious injury to Mark Pollard at Perilya Broken Hill on 8 June 2012.”


	
	The Notices stated:
	


“I am a delegate of the Director General of the Department of Trade and Investment Regional Infrastructure and Services (the Regulator) for the purposes of section 155 of the WHS Act and I have reasonable grounds to believe that you are capable of

T Giving information T Producing documents � Giving evidence


	
	It is not disputed that the regulator had “reasonable grounds” for his belief in the sense required by s 155. Additionally, on the issue of validity no issue as to the form (in terms of particularity) of the Notices was raised, other than an issue in relation to the contents of “board minutes” discussed at [108] ff.
	
	
	The Notices each stated under the word “Description”, the following:
	


“In relation to:

T A possible contravention of the WHS Act

T Assist the Regulator to monitor or enforce compliance with the WHS Act”


	
	Each Notice contained a Schedule in which the documents required to be produced were identified.
	
	
	The Notices each specified a requirement that the plaintiff produce:
	


“… un-redacted copies of the documents supplied in response to the WHSA s155 notice dated 22 May 2013 schedule list.”


	
	The Schedule to each Notice identified by reference to “Item D” and “Item H”, the disputed documents detailed above at [13]-[15]:
	
	
	The November Notice also specified documents for production being un‑redacted copies of documents listed in paragraphs 2 to 5 of the Schedule to the Notice.
	


Appeal Against Conviction

Plaintiff’s Submissions


	
	The plaintiff seeks to appeal the convictions as of right and also seeks leave to appeal the sentences in the event that it is unsuccessful in having the appeals against conviction dismissed. The four grounds relied upon in relation to the plaintiff’s conviction and sentence are in the following terms:
	


Ground 1:   The magistrate erred at law, in not finding that the notices issued under s 155 of the Work Health and Safety Act 2011, in so far as they purported to compel the production of the Disputed Documents were beyond power, and therefore, invalid.

Ground 2:   The magistrate erred both in fact and at law in that she failed to apply (properly or at all) the principle of totality in the sentences which she imposed upon the applicant.

Ground 3:   The sentences imposed upon the applicant were manifestly excessive.

Ground 4:   The order for costs made by the magistrate was not just and reasonable in all of the circumstances.” (Court Book at p 74)


	
	In his opening oral submissions, Mr Hodgkinson SC who appeared with Ms J Paingakulam of counsel for the plaintiff, identified the question of law to be answered in the appeal in the following terms:
	


“… the fundamental matter raised by these proceedings and by the proceedings below was a question of law, being the scope of the power and we have put it in our reply in this way: is the power to compel the production of documentation conferred on a regulator by s 155 of the Workplace and Safety Act, limited to documents which relate to health and safety matters that arise in or are related to New South Wales”: (T 1-2, 15 April 2015)


	
	Mr Hodgkinson properly conceded that it had not been put to Mr Smith, nor contended, that the Regulator had no reasonable grounds for the issue of the disputed Notices.
	
	
	Mr Hodgkinson submitted that there were “limitations” upon the power under s 155. The first asserted limitation was the fact that the power is contained in a New South Wales Act. The power is conferred upon a New South Wales regulator who has powers in respect of prosecutions and enforcement under the Act but that these were confined to New South Wales. Secondly, the power under s 155 does not extend to a notice that compels the production of documents that do not relate to health and safety in relation to health and safety matters that arise in or are related to New South Wales: T 3:40-45. This was said to be a jurisdictional limitation or a limitation on the regulator’s power to require the production of the disputed documents. Mr Hodgkinson stated that this did not mean that one part of the notice which exceeded the power invalidated other parts of the notice that did not: T 3:45-50.
	
	
	The plaintiff, in essence, contended that the Department did not have authority under s 155 WHS Act to require or request production of the disputed documents. The power contained in s 155 WHS Act, it was argued, is limited both by its own terms and by the Act itself. It was contended that (a) the disputed documents were outside those limitations and (b) that Magistrate Goodwin had failed to give due consideration to them.
	
	
	Her Honour, it was contended, erred in law by not finding the Notices requesting the disputed documents to be invalid.
	
	
	In the plaintiff’s Outline of Submissions it was submitted that a key limitation on the provision was created by s 155(1) of the Act. The plaintiff stated that:
	


“[sub-section (1)]…identifies the circumstances in which the section itself applies. The first criterion is that the Regulator must have “reasonable grounds to believe”. The subject matter of that belief is that the person the subject of consideration “is capable of giving information, providing documents or giving evidence”. However, those three categories, information, documents or evidence, are only in relation to certain identified circumstances being, “a possible contravention of this Act” or information, documents or evidence “that will assist the Regulator to monitor or enforce compliance with this Act.” (Plaintiff’s Outline of Submissions at [20])


	
	The plaintiff referred and relied in its Outline of Submissions upon two decisions which it contended provide assistance in determining the scope of the power contained in s 155 WHS Act. They were, it was argued, instructive notwithstanding that they concerned different provisions in different legislation. The first case was Federal Commission of Taxation v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited (1979) 143 CLR 499 which dealt with the application of s 264(1) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Cth) (referred to in submissions as the “Smorgon case”). The second was Deveson v Australian Broadcasting Tribunal (1991) 32 FCR 124, which dealt with a power to compel documents under s 21 Broadcasting Act 1942 (Cth). The plaintiff’s argument was that the power in s 155 is to be read in light of the type of limitations or restrictions established in those decisions.
	
	
	As noted at [9] above, the disputed documents appear to have been sought on the basis that there had been an accident in 2008 which was thought to have certain similarities to the one being investigated in 2012. The Notices sought documents relevant to whether any recommendations had been made following the 2008 incident, and, whether there had been any auditing process concerning implementation of any such recommendations.
	
	
	The plaintiff noted in its Outline of Submissions that the WHS Act only came into operation on 1 January 2012. It was argued for the plaintiff that because the due diligence requirements contained in s 27(1) of the Act are different to the requirements contained in the previous legislation (Occupational Health and Safety Act 2000 (NSW)) evidence of recommendations, auditing requirements and whether recommendations had been appropriately implemented could have no bearing on the issue of whether there had been compliance with the current operative provisions in the WHS Act. In the Plaintiff’s Outline of Submissions it was stated:
	


“35.   The obligation of an officer of a PCBU to exercise due diligence as set out in s 27 WHSA came into existence on 1 January 2012. Section 26 of the Occupational Health and Safety Act 2000 (the OH&S Act), the predecessor to the WHSA, created a similar obligation from 7 June 2011 only. Prior to that date, a director or manager of a corporation was deemed to have contravened the OH&S Act, unless, among other things, he or she used all due diligence to prevent the contravention by the corporation.

36.   The duties in s 27 of the WHSA and s 26 of the OH&S Act prior to 7 June 2011 are not analogous. Nor did the current legislative guidance as to what amounts to due diligence appear in the legislation prior to 7 June 2011. Accordingly, evidence of what officers of Perilya did prior to 7 June 2011 cannot inform the Department “in relation to a possible contravention of the Act” or “assist the Regulator to monitor or enforce compliance with this Act.” The Department cannot be assisted in its endeavours by evidence of what occurred before the existence of the obligations which currently apply to officer of Perilya.”


	
	In oral submissions, Mr Hodgkinson in identifying the “question of law” in the proceedings, drew attention to the import of the distinction drawn in s 155 between “a possible contravention” of the WHS Act, and documents etc that will assist the regulator to “monitor or enforce compliance” with the Act: T 7-8, 15 April 2014. These expressions, it was contended were words of limitation and that “documents” etc must relate to health and safety matters that arise in or in relation to New South Wales: T 8-9. This limitation on the scope of s 155 was said to be central to whether this appeal involved a “question of law alone”: T 9:5-15.
	
	
	It was acknowledged in the course of the plaintiff’s submissions that this Court may need to consider the terms of the Notices issued under s 155 for the purpose of determining their validity. If so, it was accepted that this would involve applying the section to the facts of the case, in which case leave to argue a mixed question of law and fact would be required under s 53(1) of the CAR Act governing appeals from the Local Court: T 9:15-25; T 10:1-5.
	
	
	The submissions for the plaintiff placed reliance upon the Smorgon case to support its contention that s 155 must be read subject to limitations, including the need for the regulator to frame a notice issued under that section in terms that identify a particular class or category of document(s) even if that class or category be defined broadly such as documents relating to “health and safety documents in or related to New South Wales”: T 16:35-41. In this case, so the argument ran, what was required was that the Notices, in relation to board minutes, should be drawn as limited to “board minutes dealing with health and safety matters in or related to New South Wales”: T 16:42-50. The Smorgon decision, it was submitted, provides a practical set of guidelines as to the scope of the relevant limitations and the way in which they are established: T 17:26-31.
	
	
	Notwithstanding that it was common ground that the plaintiff was engaged in the operations of and also had responsibilities for the PBHL Mine, extraterritorial issues were sought to be employed in support of the plaintiff’s invalidity argument. Reference in this respect was made to the fact that the plaintiff had operations in the Dominican Republic, Canada and in other Australian States: Plaintiff’s Outline of Submissions at [28].
	
	
	Information in relation to such operations outside New South Wales and other information concerning activities including mergers and acquisitions, equity raising, debt financing, and the rolling over of existing working capital facilities with banks was said to be information of a kind that could not be said to be “in relation to a possible contravention” or of assistance “to monitor enforcement compliance” as required by s 155(1): Plaintiff’s Outline of Submissions at [28]-[29]. It was further submitted:
	


“Additionally, the powers conferred by s 155 must be read, as they appear in a NSW Act, as being confined to New South Wales …” (Plaintiff’s Outline of Submissions at [29])


	
	In support of the plaintiff’s submission in this regard it was stated that there were no words of limitation contained in the request for the “disputed documents” that would alert the reader to the legitimate requirements in s 155, nor to the “territorial limitations” conferred upon powers which themselves are conferred by a New South Wales Act: Plaintiff’s Outline of Submissions at [31].
	
	
	Whilst the Plaintiff’s Outline of Submissions acknowledged that a person conducting a business or undertaking in terms of s 19 of the WHS Act was subject to obligations under the WHS Act, no reference or acknowledgment was given to the fact that the plaintiff company equally was subject to the New South Wales Act in respect of the Broken Hill mine operations in the respects to which I have already referred.
	


Respondent’s Submissions


	
	Mr Agius SC, who appeared with Mr Robert Ranken of counsel on behalf of the defendant prosecutor, submitted that the grounds of appeal relied upon by the plaintiff in the Amended Summonses does not involve a question of law alone. The determination of whether Magistrate Goodwin erred, it was submitted, called for a consideration of the terms of the November and December Notices and that this accordingly involved factual matters not a question or questions of law. In those circumstances, the respondent submitted that leave is required to appeal against the convictions, the question being one of mixed law and fact rather than of law alone as required by s 52(1) of the CAR Act.
	
	
	On behalf of the respondent it was contended in written submissions that leave should not be granted, firstly, because the plaintiff had not sought leave to appeal against conviction, and, secondly, due to the fact that it had available to it an avenue of appeal to the District Court as of right which it had failed to pursue. The regulator submitted that “appeals from the Local Court to the Supreme Court should ordinarily be reserved to appeals on grounds involving questions of law alone” and that the legislative intent apparent in the CAR Act to confine the ability to appeal to the Supreme Court in that manner “is an important matter bearing upon the Court’s exercise of the discretion to grant leave under s 53” of that Act: Respondent’s Outline of Submissions at [40]. The respondent accordingly submitted that leave to appeal should be refused. The respondent also contended that the ground of appeal was without inherent merit.
	
	
	In relation to the substantive issue raised by the plaintiff, it was contended for the respondent that there were only two preconditions to be met for the issue of a notice under s 155 and that both, it was submitted, were found to have been satisfied by Her Honour, Magistrate Goodwin. In the Respondent’s Outline of Submissions it was stated:
	


“43.   The matters that are required to exist in order to enliven the power to issue a notice under s 155 requiring the production of documents are as follows:

1)   The person issuing the notice must be the regulator (or a delegate of the regulator);

2)   The regulator must have reasonable grounds to believe that the person to whom the notice is to be issued is capable of providing documents in relation to a possible contravention of the WHS Act or that will assist the regulator to monitor or enforce compliance with the WHS Act.”


	
	It was further submitted that the plaintiff’s reliance on the Smorgon case was misplaced. In the Outline of Submissions for the respondent it was stated at [46]:
	


“It may be accepted that the power conferred on the Regulator allowing it to compel the production of documents is circumscribed by reference to limitations that are expressed in the section conferring the power. In the Smorgon case, the power to compel the production of documents was limited to documents that in fact related to a person’s income or assessment. By contrast, the power in s 155 of the WHS Act is limited to documents that the Regulator has reasonable grounds to believe relate to a possible contravention or will assist the Regulator to monitor or enforce compliance with the WHS Act. The scope of the power conferred by s 155 is considerably greater than the power at issue in the Smorgon case.”


	
	The respondent made no submission as to the relevance of the Deveson decision. I will refer to the question decided in that case below.
	
	
	The respondent also observed in its Outline of Submissions that:
	


“50.    …the [plaintiff’s] argument erroneously conflates the prospect of a recipient having a reasonable excuse for not complying with a s 155 notice with the question of validity. The validity of a s 155 notice depends upon a construction of the notice itself and a consideration as to whether the person issuing the notice had the requisite belief on reasonable grounds. It does not depend upon a subjective assessment by the recipient.

51.   The respondent [the Regulator] further submits that considerations of commercial sensitivity would not amount to a reasonable excuse to not comply with a s 155 notice. The safeguard provided by s 271 of the WHS Act recognizes that the regulator may come into the possession of confidential or sensitive information in the course of an investigation involving, inter alia, the use of its powers under s 155.

52.   It may be accepted that a bona fide claim for legal professional privilege will amount to a reasonable excuse for the purposes of s 155(5) of the WHS Act.  That is supported by s 269 of the WHS Act, which preserves the application of legal professional privilege to any document or information to which the privilege applies.

53.   However, s 155(6) provides that the accused bears an evidential burden to show a reasonable excuse. In the present matter, other than bare assertions in correspondence…the applicant did not present any evidence to discharge its evidentiary onus concerning its claims of legal professional privilege. The learned magistrate concluded that the applicant had not discharged its evidentiary onus.

54.   In any event, the applicant’s contentions also fail to grasp the point that, where the alleged contraventions concern a failure to discharge a health and safety duty, the Regulator is required to obtain evidence of both positive acts and omissions. Accordingly, the very absence in the Disputed Documents of information relating to health and safety is itself a matter that relates to a possible contravention of the WHS Act.”


	
	In relation to the plaintiff’s submission that any documents relating to their acts prior to 7 June 2011 could not have any bearing on the matter under investigation because of differences between the WHS Act and its predecessor, the respondent submitted that the asserted distinction between the two acts has no relevance to the validity of a notice issued under s 155. In this respect, it was submitted that the relevant issue is “whether Inspector Smith had reasonable grounds to believe that the applicant was capable of providing documents in relation to a possible contravention of the WHS Act”.
	
	
	The submission on this aspect continued:
	


“58.   The Disputed Documents are clearly relevant to an investigation into the foreseeability of the risk and whether officers of the applicant or its officers had taken any action or introduced any measures in compliance with their obligations of due diligence. There is no warrant for reading down s 155 of the WHS Act as the applicant seeks to do. It is no answer to a notice to produce documents caught by s 155 for a person or entity to say that it has looked at the material caught by the notice and it has determined that there is nothing in the documents that provides evidence about a possible contravention of the WHS Act. The logical conclusion of such a submission is that an entity under investigation or the Board of which is under investigation can usurp the function of investigator and lawfully decline to produce material because it or its Board of Directors is of the view that the documents are irrelevant to an investigation.”

Plaintiff’s Reply Submissions


	
	In their Outline of Submissions in Reply filed 2 April 2015, the plaintiff submitted that the Department had been aware of the incident at Perilya Southern Cross Shaft from 24 May 2008 or thereabouts. Accordingly, the incident had come to the Department’s attention prior to the investigations into the 2012 incident. It was submitted that it followed that any action that could have been taken in relation to the 2008 incident, including monitoring compliance or enforcement with the WHS Act had become statute barred by operation of ss 107 and 107A of the Occupational Health and Safety Act 2000 and s 232 of the WHS Act. It was submitted that no documents could have been relevant in relation to the earlier incident for the proper exercise of the inspector’s power that came into existence before the commencement of 2011.
	
	
	It is to be noted at this point that no ground as to limitations was raised in the grounds of appeal. However, even if a limitation provision existed and operated to preclude a prosecution, that could not, in my opinion, be a matter that concludes any issue of “relevance” in terms of the functions of the regulator nor the exercise of the s 155 power.
	
	
	The reply submissions for the plaintiff addressed the issue of whether a “question of law” was raised. It was again asserted that the power under s 155 could not compel the production of every possible class of document. Further, it was submitted that the WHS Act did not operate in respect of matters that do not have a relevant connection to New South Wales.
	
	
	The question of law to be answered on appeal was again reformulated in the reply submissions. It was submitted that there were two steps involved. The first involved the proper construction of s 155. The second was to apply that construction to the particular Notices in order to determine whether they were valid exercises of the power under s 155: Plaintiff’s Outline of Submissions in Reply at [3].
	
	
	In the alternative it was stated for the plaintiff that it applied for leave, if necessary, to raise a mixed question of law and fact pursuant to s 53 of the CAR Act. In this respect a number of matters said to be relevant to the grant of leave are set out in para [9] of the reply submissions.
	
	
	It was further submitted for the plaintiff that other avenues of appeal to the District Court available under the CAR Act cannot operate to limit the provisions of s 53: Plaintiff’s Outline of Submissions in Reply at [10].
	
	
	Further submissions were made in support of the plaintiff’s primary arguments as to the limitation that was said to exist on the power under s 155: Plaintiff’s Outline of Submissions in Reply at [12]-[15].
	


CONSIDERATION ON CONVICTION APPEAL

(1) Question of Law


	
	As noted above, Part 5 of the CAR Act provides for appeals against conviction from the Local Court to the Supreme Court on a restricted or limited basis – namely, only on a ground that involves a question of law alone: s 52(1) of the CAR Act. A person seeking to appeal a conviction or sentence on a ground that involves a question of fact or a question of mixed fact or law may only do so with the leave of the court: s 53(1) CAR Act.
	
	
	There was no dispute as to the relevant principles to be applied to an appeal against conviction in terms of ss 52(1) and 53(1) of the Act. They were summarised in the Respondent’s Written Submissions at [33] as follows:
	


“(a)   The formulation ‘a question of law alone’ is more restrictive than ‘a question of law’: R v JS [[2007] NSWCCA 272; 175 A Crim R 108] at 125 [74];

(b)   There is ‘a question of law alone’ if it can be stated and considered separately from the facts with which it may be connected in a given case: Williams [v The Queen (1986) 161 CLR 278] at 287;

(c)   Whether a provision that employs the formulation ‘that involves a question of law alone’ is more expansive than one that employs the formulation ‘on a question of law alone’ will depend on its statutory context: R v PL [(2009) 199 a Crim R 199] at 205 [22];

(d)   Where the statutory context expressly distinguishes between a ‘ground that involves a question of law alone’ and a ‘ground that involves a question of mixed law and fact’, the formulation ‘that involves a question of law’ has the same effect as that which the High Court reached in Williams that is, that no appeal is permitted on a mixed question of law and fact without leave: R v PL at 205 [21]-[23];

(e)   The requirement of leave to appeal should not be treated as a mere formality and there will be circumstances where leave will be refused: R v Rasic [Rasic v The Queen [2009] NSWCCA 202] at [12].” (Court Book at 78)


	
	As noted above, the respondent submitted that the sole ground of appeal against conviction did not raise a question of law alone. It was contended in this respect that the November and December Notices were a valid exercise of power under s 155 of the WHS Act and that this required a consideration of the factual matters of the case, in particular, the terms of the Notices. That in turn, it was submitted, involves a question of mixed fact and law. Accordingly, the plaintiff required leave to appeal: Respondent’s Outline of Submissions at [35].
	
	
	The respondent submitted that leave to appeal should not be granted. This was on three bases, including so it was contended, a lack of merit: Respondent’s Written Submission’s at [37]-[41].
	
	
	I accept that Ground 1 in the Amended Summonses requires the issue of power under s 155 to be applied to the Notices, and that the ultimate issue requires a determination as to whether the exercise of power by the regulator lawfully applied to the particular terms of the Notices. That accordingly involves questions of fact and law. However, I consider in all the circumstances, including in particular the need for clarification of the extent of power under s 155 that leave should be granted to appeal in respect of Ground 1.
	


(2) The Powers of the Regulator to Obtain Information


	
	Before dealing with the submissions and contentions made on behalf of the plaintiff as to the claimed invalidity of the Notices, it is necessary that attention be given to the width and the nature of the functions of the regulator under the WHS Act, and to the statutory provisions that provide the regulator with power to obtain information under s 155.
	
	
	The functions of the Regulator under the WHS Act are wide-ranging. They are clearly important functions. The specified function of the regulator under s 152(b), namely “to monitor and enforce compliance with this Act”, is a function that is broad in scope. The statutory function of monitoring carries with it the ordinary meaning of the word “monitor”, namely, to “observe, supervise, keep under review, measure or test at intervals, especially for the purpose of regulation or control”: Oxford English Dictionary.
	
	
	The power under s 155(1) of the Regulator to obtain “information” includes information, “… that will assist the regulator to monitor or enforce compliance with this Act”: s 155(1).
	
	
	As noted above, each of the Notices in contention in the present proceedings stated that the regulator had “reasonable grounds to believe” that the plaintiff was capable of: (a) giving information and (b) producing documents in relation to two identified matters. Those matters were: (i) a possible contravention of the Act and additionally (ii) compliance, that is to “assist the Regulator to monitor or enforce compliance with the WHS Act”.
	
	
	The width of the power under the Act to obtain documents to monitor or enforce compliance with the Act is determined, at least in part, due to the fact that the notion of “compliance” may cover or apply to a number of statutory obligations imposed upon specified persons.
	
	
	As the submissions for the respondent noted, the matters that were said to enliven the power to issue a notice under s 155 requiring the production of documents were:
	



	
	That the person issuing the notice is the Regulator (or the delegate of the Regulator).
	
	
	That the Regulator must have reasonable grounds to believe that the person to whom the notice is to be addressed is capable of providing documents in relation to a possible contravention of the WHS Act or that will assist the regulator to monitor or enforce compliance with the WHS Act: Respondent’s Outline of Submissions at [43].
	



	
	A number of provisions in the WHS Act reflect the rationale that underpins the conferral of what are broad information‑gathering coercive powers upon the Regulator. In that respect:
	



	
	The legislative objectives of the WHS Act are significant in terms of matters of health and safety. Section 3(1) provides that the main object of that Act is, inter alia, “to secure the health and safety of workers and workplaces …” by the measures set out in (a) to (b) of that provision. Section 3(1)(a) states the objective of:
	


“(a)   protecting workers and other persons against harm to their health, safety and welfare through the elimination or minimisation of risks arising from work or from specified types of substances or plant, …”


	
	A related legislative objective is directed to enhancing the protection of workers and others and to that end fostering risk minimisation. Section 3(2) provides:
	


“In furthering subsection (1) (a), regard must be had to the principle that workers and other persons should be given the highest level of protection against harm to their health, safety and welfare from hazards and risks arising from work or from specified types of substances or plant as is reasonably practicable.”


	
	There are two limbs to the provisions conferring power on the regulator under s 155(1). Each requires “reasonable grounds” for the regulator’s particular belief or state of mind. The subject-matter of the first limb is directed to the capability of a person to give information, provide documents or give evidence in relation to a possible contravention of the Act. The second limb relates not only to contraventions of the Act, but also to a broader issue, namely, to “assist” in monitoring or enforcing compliance with the Act. Information, including documents falling within the scope of the second limb are directly relevant to the performance of the regulator’s function under s 152(b). Contraventions of the Act may relate to past events. “Compliance”, though embracing past conduct or events, is also forward-looking in that it is directed at the elimination or minimisation of risks arising from work, plant, specified substances etc: s 3(1)(a) of the WHS Act.
	
	
	Central to the operation of the provisions of s 155(1) is the stated belief of the Regulator on reasonable grounds. That is an important element in the exercise of the powers conferred by the section.
	
	
	In summary, the provisions of s 155 are enlivened where “… the regulator has reasonable grounds to believe” the following matters:
	



	
	That the “person is capable” of, inter alia, providing information including documents etc;
	
	
	The “information”, “documents” and/or “evidence” concerns or relates to “a possible contravention of this Act”; and/or
	
	
	The giving of information, provision of documents or giving of evidence will assist the regulator to monitor and enforce compliance with the Act. The use of the word “assist” carries the meaning of helping or supporting or promoting the performance of the regulator’s function to monitor or enforce compliance etc.
	



	
	The Regulator is subject to a duty to perform the statutory functions specified in the WHS Act. As earlier stated these include the function of monitoring and enforcing compliance with the Act. In order for the Regulator to properly perform and discharge his responsibilities in respect of those functions in relation to the 2012 accident at the Broken Hill Mine:
	



	
	Information relevant to mine safety at the Broken Hill Mine held by the holding company of the group (the plaintiff) was plainly within the coercive power conferred in broad terms upon the Regulator under s 155 to acquire “information”.
	
	
	The fact that particular documents, such as minutes of board meetings of the plaintiff company, may contain information relevant to matters other than mine safety does not, in my opinion, result in the invalidity of the Notices issued by the Regulator.
	
	
	In relation to information obtained in the exercise of a power or function under the WHS Act the legislative scheme includes, as earlier noted, statutory protection to preserve the confidentiality of such information in s 271. In this respect, the contents of documents obtained must not be disclosed to anyone: s 271(2). Penalties are prescribed in respect of contravention of the confidentiality obligations by both an individual and by a body corporate: s 271(2).
	
	
	The Act ensures the preservation of legal professional privilege in s 269. The section prescribes: “nothing in this Act requires a person to produce a document that would disclose information, or otherwise provide information, that is the subject of legal professional privilege”.
	



	
	Insofar as certain of the disputed documents were said to be related to confidential matters or were subject to a claim for legal professional privilege, apart from an assertion of confidentiality and privilege in correspondence, the plaintiff made no attempt to support the claim by way of affidavit evidence either before the prosecution was instituted or by evidence in the hearing before the Magistrate.
	


(3) The Limitations on the Regulator’s Power under Section 155


	
	As detailed above, the plaintiff made submissions as to asserted territorial limitations on the power of the Regulator. For reasons that follow, I do not, with respect, consider that territorial limitations operated so as to limit the Notices issued by Mr Smith on behalf of the Department under s 155. Accordingly, there is no foundation for the contention that the Magistrate failed or erred in not giving consideration to the scope of the alleged limitations referred to in the submissions of the plaintiff set out in its Outline of Submissions in these proceedings filed 23 February 2015.
	
	
	The fact that the plaintiff company is registered in Western Australia and the company has its office in Perth, are not decisive considerations. The company, as noted above, has other business operations in other States and in other countries, which, at least in part, are within the control of the plaintiff.
	
	
	The plaintiff company, on the evidence before the Magistrate, some of which has been referred to above, was also directly “involved” in the Broken Hill Mine at a number of levels. In particular:
	



	
	The plaintiff and its Board of Directors had ultimate control over the operations of the Broken Hill Mine.
	
	
	The plaintiff had been directly involved in and had responsibilities in respect of occupational health and safety matters affecting and/or arising out of the operation of the Broken Hill Mine.
	
	
	The plaintiff, by reason of its operations in New South Wales, its control of the same and its responsibilities for the proper operation of the Mine was subject to the statutory obligations imposed upon it under the New South Wales Act (the WHS Act).
	
	
	Knowledge, in particular the corporate knowledge of the plaintiff in relation to mine safety issues in its operation in other States (and in other countries) relevant to the safe operation of the New South Wales mine was corporate knowledge that, at least potentially, is of significance and importance to the safe operation of the Broken Hill Mine.
	



	
	The plaintiff’s submissions, as earlier noted, relied heavily upon the limitations found to have existed in the Smorgon case. Accordingly, it is necessary to examine the nature of the issues that fell for decision in that case
	
	
	In Smorgon, the recipients of notices issued by the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation challenged their validity. In particular, a question arose as to the validity of four notices issued to ANZ (the Bank) to attend and produce books, documents and papers contained in four named safety deposit boxes in a branch of the Bank in Melbourne.
	
	
	The relevant statutory provisions were contained in s 264(1) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Cth) which was in the following terms:
	


“The Commissioner may by notice in writing require any person, whether a taxpayer or not, including any officer employed in or in connexion with any department of a Government or by any public authority-

(a)   to furnish him with such information as he may require; and

(b)   to attend and give evidence before him or before any officer authorised by him in that behalf concerning his or any other person's income or assessment, and may require him to produce all books, documents and other papers whatever in his custody or under his control relating thereto.""


	
	The documents, books and papers sought in Smorgon related to two specific matters stipulated in s 264(1)(b), namely, “income or assessment” of a person: See the observations of Gibbs ACJ at p 523.
	
	
	Whilst the approach of the High Court in the Smorgon case to the construction of the power under ss 263 and 264 of the income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Cth) is instructive, its application to the present case necessarily is to be approached with a degree of caution. This is due to the fact that the terms of s 155(1) are fundamentally different from those considered in Smorgon. Section 155(1) of the WHS Act, unlike the notice provisions under ss 263 and 264, as discussed above, provides for a “reasonable ground to believe” provision. Additionally, the power under s 155 has a broader scope or reach than the powers under s 263 and 264. This arises, in part, because of the phrases, “a possible contravention of this Act” or that will “assist the regulator to monitor or enforce compliance with this Act”. Even within these formulations, the statutory terms in s 155, “possible” (contravention), “this Act” and “assist” each involve broad, not narrow, concepts.
	
	
	Additionally, the objects of the WHS Act as stated in s 3, are material in the construction of s 155. An “objects clause” in a statute aids the interpretation and guides decision-makers as to what is to be taken into account when they exercise their powers or perform functions under the Act: see DC Pearce and RS Geddes, Statutory Interpretation in Australia, 6th ed, LexisNexis, Butterworths, Sydney 2006. The Regulator in his/her exercise of power conferred by s 155 is required to consider and give effect to the objects, in particular, those set out in s 3(1)(a), (e) and (g) of the Act with due regard, in particular, to be given to the object in s 3(1)(a) (“protecting workers and other persons against harm to their health, safety and welfare …”) and s 3(2) WHS Act.
	
	
	As mentioned above, the plaintiff in the present case, in particular, argued that the Notices issued under s 155 were so broadly expressed that they were beyond power. In directing production of “board minutes”, without words of limitation as for example, by the inclusion of a class or category such as “health and safety documents in or related to New South Wales” meant, it was argued, that the Notices exceeded the “limitations” upon the terms of s 155 (T 16:40-41, 15 April 2015).
	
	
	This line of argument, based as it was upon textual considerations in relation to s 155 and observations in Smorgon as to the Commissioner’s power in a taxation investigation, is one to be carefully assessed with due regard to the regulator’s remit, in particular his/her functions granted by s 152. In a case involving two serious accidents (as in the present case concerning mine shaft accidents in 2008 and 2012) investigations plainly may include inquiry into the discrete acts or omissions directly associated with each accident as well as any relevant broader “upstream” or systemic issues in a particular workplace and/or in the overall operations, including the management of risk by an operating entity. Board minutes of a company or companies involved in and/or responsible for such matters may, at least as a possibility, have relevance to such investigations as a record of management, either for what they record or fail to record. In the context of the present case, involving a particular history of accidents, issues such as the reporting to, supervision by, and response of, the Board of Directors of the company on health and safety issues and for the allocation of financial resources, may have relevance to issues of compliance with the WHS Act, a matter to which express reference is made in s 155(1).
	
	
	There cannot, of course, be any exhaustive prescription, as to what matters may provide reasonable grounds of belief for the Regulator’s use of powers under s 155(1), each case turning on its own facts. There is, as earlier noted, no challenge to the Notices in this case in terms of the existence of “reasonable grounds” or the Regulator’s belief based on such grounds. Whilst in the course of oral submissions Mr Hodgkinson referred to the Regulator’s Notices as in effect saying “… give me all your documents …” (T 17:41-42), that was more in the nature of a rhetorical flourish. The Notices were drafted in a manner that left no room for uncertainty as to which documents were to be produced.
	
	
	Whether, for example, a notice issued by the regulator that directs the production of documents concerning the salaries and travel allowances paid to directors of a company could be susceptible to challenge on the ground of invalidity, is not a matter that requires determination in this case.
	
	
	The argument as developed in the submissions for the plaintiff was premised, in my respectful opinion, wrongly, upon the proposition that documents described in a s 155 notice as “board minutes” could not relate in any way to health and safety issues under the WHS Act. That premise, however, is advanced purely by way of assertion, especially in circumstances where there was no challenge made to the grounds for the Regulator’s belief. There was no evidence beyond assertions made in correspondence that established that board minutes of either the parent or operating company (or both) could have no possible bearing upon such issues.
	
	
	As stated above, it may be envisaged that a consistent omission in a particular company’s records of any reference to consideration having been given by the directors or managers of a company on safety issues may conceivably have probative value. The fact that particular records such as board minutes may, as would be expected, deal with issues other than or additional to those concerned with health and safety (eg, a takeover bid) does not of itself place the minutes beyond the reach of s 155. They, in my opinion, are subject to the compellable power under the section, confidentiality, and a claim of privilege being available as protective measures under the Act as earlier discussed.
	
	
	It is important to again emphasise that the provisions of s 155(1) of the WHS Act are considerably wider in scope than were the provisions of s 264(1) under consideration in the Smorgon case. Section 155(1) contains the expression “in relation to” a possible contravention of the Act. As noted above, s 155(1) refers to documents etc “… that will assist the regulator to monitor or enforce compliance with this Act.” The Notices issued by the Regulator in the present case, as also noted above, were expressly directed both to “a possible contravention of this Act” and to “assist the Regulator to monitor or enforce compliance with the WHS Act”, the Regulator importantly having stated that he held the requisite belief, on the basis of reasonable grounds, as to each of those two matters.
	
	
	The power under s 155(1), unlike that under s 264(1) considered in Smorgon, is sufficiently broad to enable a regulator to obtain and examine documents called for in a notice where he/she holds the requisite belief on reasonable grounds for the purpose of determining whether in some relevant way, they do or may assist in determining whether a contravention of the WHS Act has occurred and/or for monitoring or enforcing compliance with the WHS Act. This, in my opinion, applies to the plaintiff company, and PBHL, or both.
	
	
	It, of course, is to be borne in mind, as discussed above, that documents the subject of a belief of the regulator on reasonable grounds are not confined to documents that establish an affirmative fact, such as, for example, remedial action taken following an accident. Documents obtained under s 155 may be capable of also establishing a negative – that on a particular matter related to risk of injury or safety, a person failed to take any action or any adequate action to address such matters. The net may need to be cast in wide terms in order to obtain documents that may directly or indirectly bear upon issues of contravention or compliance with statutory obligations.
	
	
	There is no basis, in my opinion, for the proposition advanced for the plaintiff that s 155 is to be read as subject to a qualification or limitation that the person to whom a s 155 notice is addressed has an unrestricted right to determine for himself or herself whether documents have a connection or a sufficient connection with the matter under investigation. Such “right” could plainly undermine the integrity of an investigation authorised by the WHS Act even to the point of negativing the express statutory powers conferred under it. The protections built into the Act under ss 269 and 271 are themselves strong indications against any possible implied limitation that would render the compulsive power under s 155 subject to a power or right, in this case in the plaintiff, to determine what documents must be produced.
	
	
	The plaintiff additionally relied upon the decision of the Federal Court (Davies J) in Deveson v Australian Broadcasting Tribunal (1991) 32 FCR 124 to support its argument that the power under s 155 must be read subject to the limitations as argued in submissions.
	
	
	I, with respect, do not consider that the decision in that case is of assistance in resolving the issue in the present proceedings. It is sufficient to state that the Federal Court was concerned with summonses that had been issued under s 21(2) of the Broadcasting Act 1942 (Cth), in relation to an application, brought under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth). The Australian Broadcasting Tribunal in relation to that application was conducting an inquiry in relation to the transfer of certain broadcasting licences.
	
	
	Davies J observed that the Tribunal, which exercised the statutory power, must act within the limits of that power. His Honour observed that it was a necessary implication in s 21, which uses the expression “for the purposes of proceedings before the Tribunal” that any document required to be produced be a document that may assist the Tribunal in its inquiry. The issue concerned the relevance of the documents sought under the summons, it being observed that the Tribunal had no power to compel production of documents that had no relevance whatever to its inquiry.
	
	
	Accordingly, the circumstances in Deveson v Australian Broadcasting Tribunal were very different from the present proceedings. Firstly, that case involved a question of an inquiry being conducted by a tribunal involving interested parties. Secondly, the issue of “limitation” on the power in question turned on the question of apparent relevance of documents to the issues. Davies J observed that although s 21 did not contain express limitations on the power it was a provision that did not confer an unlimited power on the Tribunal to require the production of any documents whatsoever: Deveson at p 131. The inquiry being conducted by the Tribunal, it was noted, had a “limited ambit”. The determination was that the summonses had been drafted too broadly to include documents which had no bearing upon the issues that were the subject of the inquiry (at pp 131-2).
	
	
	In contrast, as has been discussed, the Regulator’s power under s 155 does not have “a limited ambit” but rather as discussed, it has a broad scope. Secondly, unlike the inquiry in Deveson v Australian Broadcasting Tribunal, the scope of the matters to which the power relates under s 155 is not restricted or limited to “issues” but is conferred to wide-ranging matters under the WHS Act as specified in the section.
	
	
	There having been no dispute from the time the Notices were served upon the plaintiff that the Regulator had reasonable grounds for his stated belief, the plaintiff was subject to a statutory obligation to comply with them by producing the documents in strict conformity with the terms of the Notices.
	
	
	In particular, there is no requirement for the regulator to know in advance the actual contents of the documents called for. It is sufficient that he/she has formed the belief on reasonable grounds concerning one or other of the subject matters specified in s 155(1) as discussed above. Once such a belief is held, the regulator has the right to issue a notice for production of documents concerning either a contravention of the Act or for the purposes of monitoring compliance or enforcing the Act. There is no other unstated condition to be satisfied. A similar point was considered in the Smorgon case by Gibbs ACJ at 524:
	


“There is no justification for reading into s 264(1)(b) a condition precedent which it does not express. There are likely to be many cases in which documents that relate to a taxpayer's taxable income will be of great assistance to the Commissioner in performing his duties under the Act, although the Commissioner is unable, before seeing the documents, to say that they are relevant to a particular issue. It would be an unwarranted limitation on the power given by the section to hold that the Commissioner can only obtain documents if he knows that they provide evidence on a particular matter. The apparent intention of the Parliament is that the Commissioner is entitled to have produced any books and documents that relate to the taxpayer's income or assessment, even if he does not know what those books and documents may reveal. A document may be required to be produced only if it in fact relates to the income or assessment of the person in question, but if it is of that description, that is enough. In other words the Commissioner is entitled to make what was described as a ""roving enquiry"" into the income or assessment of a particular taxpayer and for that purpose to have produced such documents as relate to that income or assessment.”


	
	Finally, I note that the plaintiff did not seek in this case to invoke and establish “reasonable excuse” under the provisions of s 155(5) supported by affidavit provided to the Regulator or by any evidence adduced in the proceedings determined by the Magistrate to support such an excuse.
	


Conclusion


	
	In relation to Ground 1, I have accordingly concluded that the Magistrate did not err at law in not finding that the Notices issues under s 155 of the WHS Act were beyond power and were therefore invalid in terms of this ground of appeal.
	
	
	Upon examination of the Notices, it is clear that they satisfied the conditions specified in s 155. The learned Magistrate was, with respect, correct in making a finding to that effect. Accordingly, no error has been established as contended for by the plaintiff.
	


The Sentence Appeal


	
	Magistrate Goodwin made the following statement in relation to sentence:
	


“The prosecution submit [sic] that the non-compliance caused considerable delay, and prevented the regulator from properly investigating. It is therefore, to quote Cessnock City Council v Quintaz Pty Ltd (2010) 172 LER 52 [sic – LGERA], Pepper J said:

‘Any compromise in the access to information required by the authority results in a concomitant compromise in the ability of that authority to ensure compliance with the Act and to protect against environmental harm.’

The need for general and specific deterrence is taken into account for the purposes of sentencing to make the offender accountable for its actions, and to denounce the conduct of the offender. Indeed, Inspector Smith said that he wished to investigate what, if any, relationship there was between the incident, and an earlier incident in the mine in 2008. In particular, the documents sought could have revealed whether any recommendation made following the 2008 incident was the subject of direction or action or lack thereof by the offender or any of its officers. I agree with those submissions.” (T 43-44, 13 October 2014)


	
	There were, as earlier noted, two grounds relied upon by the plaintiff in the sentence appeal. I will deal with each in turn.
	


Ground 2: The Magistrate erred both in fact and at law in that she failed to apply (properly or at all) the principle of totality in the sentences which she imposed upon the applicant


	
	The written submissions for the plaintiff extracted the following passage from the Magistrate’s decision on sentence:
	


“Now I turn now to the principle of totality. It is the failure to comply with the notices that is the subject of the offences. The fact that it is the same subject matter in both should not reduce the culpability of the offender. I have taken totality into account, in particular whether the sentences will reflect the total criminality before the Court. It is noted that the maximum statutory penalty in this matter is $50,000 and that is of assistance in determining the objective gravity of the offence, and demonstrates the seriousness of which these offences are viewed.” (T 43, 13 October 2014)


	
	Her Honour imposed a fine of $20,000 in relation to each offence in respect of which the plaintiff was convicted.
	
	
	It was submitted for the plaintiff that the Magistrate imposed the penalties in respect of each offence without first determining the appropriate sentence for each, absent considerations of totality before turning to consider the questions of totality: Plaintiff’s Outline of Submissions at [41].
	
	
	In addition, it was contended that the Magistrate imposed the same penalty in respect of each offence notwithstanding that the documents sought in each were the same so that there was no additional harm suffered by the second breach over and above the first and that the offences were clearly related and occurred within a short time span.
	
	
	The respondent’s submission was that this ground did not involve a question of law alone. It contended that the ground requires a consideration of the factual matters bearing upon the application of the principle of totality in the context of the matter. Accordingly, leave of the Court was required. It was submitted that the applicant should not be granted leave.
	
	
	In addition, the respondent contended that the ground had no merit.
	
	
	The respondent in support of the submission in this respect observed that her Honour considered that each of the offences was a separate act of criminality. The fact that there was a commonality between the documents sought by the November and the December notices did not, it was submitted, significantly affect the sentences required to be imposed so as to reflect the separate and additional acts and that each act attracted criminal sanction: Respondent’s Outline of Submissions at [65].
	
	
	It was further submitted on behalf of the respondent that contrary to the implied assertion by the applicant that the principles in Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610 applied, the principles as enunciated by the High Court in that case do not require a sentencing court to expressly state the individual penalty that it would have imposed prior to applying the principles of totality. In that respect it was observed that totality is not a discount to be applied to an otherwise appropriate sentence. The Court is required to review the aggregate of the fines and consider whether it is just and appropriate as a reflection of the criminality overall.
	
	
	It was submitted for the respondent that her Honour had regard to the principle of totality and rejected the contention that the offences did not involve separate acts of criminality.
	


Ground 3: The sentences imposed upon the applicant were manifestly excessive


	
	It was submitted on behalf of the plaintiff that a fine of $20,000 was excessive in respect of each offence when consideration was given to the following matters set out in their Outline of Submissions at [47]:
	


“a.   That the scope of s 155 was a live question and there was no earlier decision providing guidance.

b.   The applicant had an arguable case in respect of the validity of the notices and it was appropriate that the applicant’s substantial arguments be resolved by a court.

c.   The applicant had co-operated with the Department in that it had provided a very substantial volume of material to the Department; indeed it was only a very small part of the total that was disputed.

d.   A number of interviews were also conducted by the Department over a number of days at Broken Hill. The Department had unrestricted access to personnel at the mine site.

e.   The applicant also made a number of its senior personnel available for interview by the prosecutor in 2010, even where those persons were not domiciled in NSW; and

f.   All safety material for PBHL for the 6 months prior to the Mark Pollard incident was provided to the Department.

g.   Prosecutions were commenced alleging breaches of WHSA duties against Perilya and others including officers on 10 June 2014.”


	
	It was further submitted for the plaintiff that the nature of the breaches were at the bottom of a range of objective seriousness for the category of offending in question.
	
	
	It was also submitted that it was clear the plaintiff had provided all safety material in relation to the incident on 8 June 2012 and the Broken Hill Mine. Additionally, it was argued that the documents sought in relation to each Notice were the same and that no additional harm was suffered by the second breach.
	
	
	It was submitted that a fine of $20,000 in relation to each of the two offences was excessive in all of the circumstances. The plaintiff sought a variation of the sentences imposed by the Local Court in respect of each offence.
	
	
	The respondent submitted that the Court could appropriately refuse leave to argue this ground of appeal, or otherwise reject it.
	
	
	The respondent contended that what the applicant was seeking was a rehearing of the evidence given in the Local Court on sentence. It was submitted that this was apparent on the basis that the applicant urged the Court to make a different finding as to objective seriousness of the offences without asserting any error on the part of the learned Magistrate: Respondent’s Outline of Submissions at [74].
	
	
	The respondent’s contention was that a mere recitation of the matter previously urged upon the Magistrate did not establish error in the nature of manifest excess. In order to make out this ground it was submitted that there would at least need to be a demonstration that upon the facts as found by the learned Magistrate the sentence was unreasonable or plainly unjust so as to warrant this Court inferring that in some way there had been failure to properly exercise the sentencing discretion.
	
	
	Finally, the respondent contended that her Honour’s finding that the offence was in the low to medium range of objective seriousness was an assessment open to her. The maximum penalty as prescribed by Parliament was one important indicator of the seriousness of the offences. Additionally, the need for general and specific deterrence as identified by her Honour, were also relevant matters, and supported the penalties imposed, notwithstanding the plaintiff’s lack of prior convictions: Respondent’s Outline of Submissions at [75].
	
	
	The submission for the respondent was that the penalties were not unreasonable or plainly unjust and that leave should either be refused or this ground otherwise rejected.
	


Determination on Grounds 2 and 3


	
	On the issue of totality, a reading of the Magistrate’s decision on sentence makes it plain that her Honour applied the principle of totality in determining the penalties to be imposed in a conventional and proper manner.
	
	
	Her Honour was clearly correct in stating that the culpability of the plaintiff should not be reduced by reason of the fact that the same documents were sought in each of the notices.
	
	
	Each contravention of s 155 was a separate offence which had the effect of delaying or hindering investigations into the mine accident. Such offending conduct, as indicated by the maximum penalty for an offence of that kind, reflects the gravity of conduct involving wilful non-compliance with a Notice properly issued under s 155 of the WHS Act. The penalties to be imposed were required to give effect to both general and specific deterrence. Non-compliance of the kind in this case, not surprisingly, may attract substantial penalties.
	
	
	In the application of the totality principle in relation to the two offences in question, the observations of Howie J in Cahyadi v R (2007) 168 A Crim R 41 at [27] are apposite:
	


“… the issue is determined by the application of the principle of totality of criminality: can a sentence for one offence comprehend and reflect the criminality for the other offence? If it can, the sentences ought to be concurrent otherwise there is a risk that the combined sentences will exceed that which is warranted to reflect the total criminality of the two offences. If not, the sentences should be at least partly cumulative otherwise there is a risk that the total sentence will fail to reflect the total criminality of the two offences. This is so regardless of whether the two offences represent two discrete acts of criminality or can be regarded as part of a single episode of criminality. Of course it is more likely that where the offences are discrete and independent acts, the sentence for one offence cannot comprehend the criminality of the other …”


	
	I accept the submissions on behalf of the respondent that the two offences involved separate acts of non-compliance such that the criminality involved in one could not comprehend or reflect the criminality in the other.
	
	
	I further accept that no error has been demonstrated, whether of fact or law, by the Magistrate in respect of the penalties imposed. In particular, no error has been demonstrated in her Honour’s determination that the offending conduct fell in the low to medium range of objective seriousness. Bearing in mind that the maximum penalty for such an offence was $50,000, the imposition of a fine of $20,000 in relation to each offence – that is a little less than half the maximum penalty for each offence – I consider to be in line with the factual findings made by her Honour.
	
	
	I do not consider that any sentencing error has been established. In particular, I do not consider that the penalties imposed by way of sentence were manifestly excessive.
	
	
	I consider that whilst leave should be granted in relation to Grounds 2 and 3 relied upon in the sentencing appeal, the appeal against penalty should be dismissed
	


Appeal From Magistrate’s Order for Costs


	
	Ground 4 relates to the costs order made by the Magistrate and is in the following terms:
	


“Ground 4: The order for costs made by the Magistrate was not just and reasonable in all of the circumstances.”


	
	In the Plaintiff’s Outline of Submissions it was noted that the Magistrate made the costs order in favour of the Department in the amount sought. It was noted that s 215(1) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 permits the Court to award such professional costs as the Court considers just and reasonable. Such an order is a sentence for the purposes of the CAR Act according to s 3(e) of the definition of “sentence” in that Act.
	
	
	As was noted in the plaintiff’s submissions, the respondent had provided the Magistrate with a Schedule of Costs setting out the basis on which the quantum of costs order was sought: T 163-8, 13 October 2014. Whilst in the plaintiff’s submissions it was stated that the respondent had not provided any “evidence” to support the Schedule there was no objection to the Magistrate’s use of the Schedule as a guide, other than specific criticisms made. Further, it was stated that the Schedule did not provide multipliers in respect of each item so that it was not possible for the Court to determine either the rates charged for a given task, nor the time taken for that task.
	
	
	Reliance was placed upon the decision in Caltex Refining Co Pty Ltd v Maritime Services Board of NSW (1995) 36 NSWLR 552 for the proposition that for an order on costs to be just and reasonable the Court must provide the parties a fair hearing on the merits and the terms of the orders made themselves must be reasonable.
	
	
	Consideration of whether the costs ordered against the plaintiff were just and reasonable involves consideration of the rates of charge, the extent of the work undertaken and the time taken to undertake the work: Ly v Jenkins (2001) 114 FCR 237 at [164].
	
	
	It was submitted that the onus is on the claimant to establish reasonableness of the costs claimed: Director General of NSW Dept of Agriculture v Temmingh [2003] NSWSC 598 at [11].
	
	
	It was submitted for the plaintiff that, given the “paucity of detail” provided in the Schedule of Costs provided by the respondent, there was no basis available to the Court to properly determine whether the costs claimed on a party/party basis were reasonable. It was submitted that costs on a solicitor/client basis should not have been awarded at all. Accordingly, it was submitted that the court erred in making any order as to costs on the information before it.
	
	
	In the event that the Court was persuaded that there was error as pleaded in Ground 4, it was submitted that the Court should set aside the costs order and remit the matter to the Local Court pursuant to s 55(2)(c) of the CAR Act to determine the question of costs.
	
	
	In the written submissions for the respondent, it was submitted that the Court may appropriately refuse leave to argue this ground, or otherwise reject it.
	
	
	In relation to the discretion to award costs under s 215 of the Criminal Procedure Act it was submitted that that discretion is a wide one. The Court may order that the accused person pay “such professional costs as the court considers just and reasonable”.
	
	
	The respondent accepted that it had the onus of establishing an entitlement to costs and to establish that they were just and reasonable. In the present case it was observed that a Schedule in relation to costs had been prepared and was provided to both the company’s solicitors and to the Local Court. The Schedule separated the work undertaken into categories. The schedule also included detailed descriptions of the work. It also included the amount of professional costs sought in respect of that work. This, it was submitted, provided sufficient information upon which her Honour could determine whether the costs sought were just and reasonable.
	
	
	It was also observed that her Honour had the assistance of submissions as to reasonableness of the work undertaken, having regard to the manner in which the proceedings were conducted. It was noted that both parties were represented by Senior and Junior Counsel at a two‑day defended hearing. It was also noted that there was a considerable volume of documentary material that had to be prepared and considered during the hearing. Apart from the hearing, there was preparation required and appearance at a further sentence hearing.
	
	
	It was noted that the plaintiff was given the opportunity to be heard on the question of whether a costs order should be made and on the issue of the quantum of any such costs order. The plaintiff had taken the opportunity and had made submissions on those matters.
	
	
	It was further observed that the learned Magistrate had regard to all of the above matters in determining whether the costs sought were just and reasonable. It was stated that her Honour noted that although the proceedings were not factually difficult they were nonetheless proceedings of importance and the prosecution had been put to strict proof. It was observed that it had been noted on the Schedule that it did not include in-house legal costs of the prosecutor or solicitor/client costs.
	
	
	Further, it was submitted that the applicant had not established any error in the exercise of the discretion under s 215 of the Criminal Procedure Act.
	
	
	Accordingly, the respondent’s contention was that Ground 4 had no merit and the Court should refuse leave or otherwise reject the ground.
	


Determination on Costs Appeal


	
	The Magistrate was entitled in the exercise of her discretion to have regard to the nature of the proceedings, the way in which they were conducted, the degree of complexity involved, the evident preparation that had been undertaken by the parties, the issues raised, and the importance of the matter as litigated before her. The learned Magistrate, of course, having then recently heard the proceedings, was in an ideal position to have regard and take account of such matters in the exercise of the discretion on costs.
	
	
	The amount of costs awarded by her Honour was not derived from an unsupported estimate. The respondent had prepared the Schedule with detail provided on the matters identified above. The Schedule was constructed so that the particular work was identified for which charges were sought and details provided as to professional costs of both instructing solicitors and counsel briefed in the matter.
	
	
	No objection was taken to the Schedule being relied upon on the issue of costs as an aid or guide for the Court in the exercise of the discretion. The transcript of the evidence of 13 October 2014 at pp 37-8 records the submissions made on the question of costs. In relation to specific detail in the schedule, limited matters only were identified in the Schedule as calling for specific comment. There were five matters in particular. The first was an observation that on the first day of the hearing, a partner was present as well as another solicitor, apparently an employed solicitor. A question was raised as to the appropriateness of having two solicitors there, although it is noted that that only one solicitor attended on the second day.
	
	
	The response by counsel for the respondent was that it was not unusual to have two solicitors there on the first day of a hearing and it was appropriate thereafter to have only one solicitor.
	
	
	The second matter related to the daily rate of the employed solicitor ($1,470) and the combined rate of the solicitors for the first day, being the figure of $6,813.50. It was submitted that no basis had been made out for the combined charge.
	
	
	The third matter concerned category 3A in the schedule. The comment made by Senior Counsel for the respondent was that there was no detail as to “who’s involved in that, or why”. A query was made as to whether the amount claimed related to a partner or a lawyer: T 38:5-15, 13 October 2014.
	
	
	The fourth matter related to the entry ‘Drafting further statement” for which a charge of $3,245 was raised but that there was no basis upon which it could be determined whether that particular charge was reasonable. It was said it was not known what it related to, or whether it was calculated on the solicitor/client basis: T 38:15-20.
	
	
	The fifth matter, was a submission that the Magistrate could not determine that the costs were reasonable. Reference was then made to counsels’ fees and a submission made as to the rates of $4,000 a day or $400 an hour and the total charged over two days. The balance of counsels’ fees, it was presumed, related to preparation: T 38:30-40.
	
	
	The particular submission made was there was no reason for that level of preparation for Senior Counsel in the proceedings. There was not enough information, it was submitted, to determine reasonableness in respect of that charge: T 38:40-50.
	
	
	Senior Counsel for the respondent in his submissions on costs noted that what had been stated on the respondent’s behalf on the question of costs was only a “very quick analysis and not an in depth one” because it was said that counsel had not been provided with “the mechanism”, nor had the Magistrate, to undertake any in-depth analysis of those costs: T 39:1-10.
	
	
	I do not consider, that this lastmentioned matter has been made out. The parties had been provided with the opportunity of dealing with the question of costs and making submissions on any costs order sought. There had been prepared on behalf of the respondent the Schedule which was provided to the plaintiff’s legal representatives and also provided to the learned Magistrate. The Schedule addressed a number of matters and was structured so as to identify particular areas of charges made or professional costs of the solicitors who instructed on day one of the hearing, and of the solicitor who attended on the second day of the hearing.
	
	
	In relation to counsels costs, the rates or charges upon which counsels’ fees have been calculated were stated.
	
	
	It was noted by Senior Counsel for the respondent that the Schedule did not specify specific rates or particular times for individual items on the Schedule.
	
	
	Although the analysis of costs contained in the Schedule could have provided a greater level of detail, in particular, on the matters referred to by the plaintiff, the fact of the matter was that it was prepared with sufficient data or information to identify the basis or foundation for the total amount of costs order sought. Whilst particular criticisms were made in the submissions for the plaintiff it is to be noted that no application was made for an adjournment to permit the plaintiff to challenge the Schedule as to its accuracy or otherwise, as for example, requiring the production of primary accounting or other records held by the Department’s solicitors to justify the costs. There was, understandably, no suggestion made that the Schedule was other than a bona fide analysis based on source materials. In other words, in those circumstances it was open to the Magistrate to use the schedule as a guide in the exercise of the discretion on costs, the Magistrate having been the tribunal that heard and determined the proceedings on its merits.
	
	
	Whilst questions were raised about particular charges or fees, it is noted that there was no submission made that the claims made for various items of work were self-evidently excessive.
	
	
	The Magistrate’s discretion to award costs was a broad one to be exercised in light of the nature of the litigation, the number of hearing days, the evident preparation involved, including preparation of affidavit material and submissions, the justification for both parties to be represented by counsel, in particular Senior and Junior Counsel, the presence of two instructing solicitors on the first of the two days’ hearing and the nature and content of the cost items set out in the Schedule, and the submissions of the parties.
	
	
	The total amount of costs sought by the Department was not self-evidently excessive given the matters and circumstances referred to above. The material placed before the Magistrate, in my opinion, provided an adequate basis for her Honour to have made the assessment of costs ordered. I do not consider that Ground 4 has been made out.
	
	
	No error having been demonstrated in the Magistrate’s approach on the question of costs I do not consider that leave should be granted to the respondent on that issue. Accordingly Ground 4 should be dismissed.
	


Orders

In each of proceedings 2014/328915 and 2014/328923, I make the following orders:


	
	Leave granted to the plaintiff to appeal against conviction pursuant to s 53(1)(b) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001.
	
	
	The appeal against conviction in Ground 1 be dismissed.
	
	
	Leave granted to the plaintiff to appeal in respect of the penalties imposed by the Local Court on 13 October 2014.
	
	
	The appeal against penalties in Grounds 2 and 3 be dismissed.
	
	
	Leave to appeal refused in respect of the appeal for the costs order made by the Local Court on 13 October 2014 in Ground 4.
	
	
	Leave granted to either party to apply on the issue of the costs of these proceedings.

2703286,Jeffreys v R [2015] NSWCCA 132,"Judgment


	
	HOEBEN CJ AT CL:   I agree with Davies J
	
	
	R A HULME J:   I agree with the orders proposed by Davies J for the reasons his Honour provides.
	
	
	Upon my own assessment of the evidence I am satisfied that it was open to the jury to be satisfied of the applicant's guilt beyond reasonable doubt.
	
	
	One particular aspect of the evidence to my mind rendered the prosecution case particularly persuasive. The complainant said in her evidence that she woke to a feeling of wetness between her legs which made her think that someone had had sex with her. She immediately went and confronted the applicant as he returned to his room from the shower and:
	


""I said something along the lines of 'What did you do to me, what have you done to me'.""


	
	Almost immediately and in the ensuing two to three hours there were complaints made to three witnesses. Her mother's evidence was that the complainant said that she woke to a realisation that something was wrong and she went and asked the applicant:
	


""Have you done something to me, have you, have you done something wrong to me?""


	
	A woman who regarded the complainant as a niece said that the complaint to her included:
	


""I woke up and felt something was wrong. It felt like I'd just had sex and then I heard the shower and I went into [the applicant] and I said, 'did you do something to me?'""


	
	The doctor who examined the complainant at the hospital recorded that the complainant said she confronted her uncle and said:
	


""What's going on, have you done something to me"".


	
	Given there was such consistency between the complainant's evidence about this aspect and her contemporaneous complaints it was well open to the jury to accept it. It strongly supports the notion that the complainant was not aware at the time that it occurred that the applicant had intercourse with her. In turn, this strongly supports the notion that the applicant must have been aware that she was not consenting, or at the very least that he was reckless as to consent.
	
	
	In the light of this evidence, the applicant's case was incredible. It was to the effect that the complainant willingly engaged in intercourse with him and concluded their intimacy by giving him a kiss on the lips. But then, a matter of minutes later, she was querying what had occurred. The proposition that the complainant had simply forgotten in that short passage of time was quite preposterous.
	
	
	A matter that was particularly damaging to the applicant's credibility in my view was his statement to the police officers who arrested him the same morning. He provided a version of events which was broadly consistent with his case at trial. But it included him saying, ""She put her hands in my underpants, that should prove she was awake, that it was consensual"" (emphasis added). According to the evidence, no-one before this time had suggested to the applicant that the complainant was contending that she had been asleep.
	
	
	These matters, combined with those that are discussed by Davies J, rendered a verdict of guilt quite unsurprising.
	
	
	DAVIES J:   The Applicant stood trial before Judge Wells SC and a jury on one count of having sexual intercourse with CS without her consent knowing that CS had not consented to the sexual intercourse.    He was found guilty and sentenced to a non-parole period of 20 months commencing 12 February 2014 and expiring 11 October 2015 with an additional term of two years expiring 11 October 2017.
	
	
	He now appeals on the following two grounds:
	


1.   The Jury's verdict of guilty was unreasonable and cannot be    supported by the evidence.

2.   The summing up was unfair and resulted in a miscarriage of    justice.


	
	A third “ground” was identified in these terms:
	


3.   No complaint was made by defence counsel at the trial about the directions, and the grounds involve mixed fact and law. If leave is required under Rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules, then leave is sought.

Leave is accordingly required for both Grounds 1 and 2, but if Ground 2 is made out, ordinarily leave under rule 4 would be given because a miscarriage of justice would thereby be demonstrated.


	
	The facts are usefully summarised in the Trial Judge’s Remarks on Sentence. It will be necessary to supplement them later with respect to particular matters.
	


The offender, at the time of the offence, was aged fifty-three and the complainant was aged twenty-nine. She is his niece, being the daughter of his sister.

On 8 February 2012, the complainant, [CS], had just broken up or was in the process of a break up with her boyfriend. She was very upset at the time and discussed this matter with the offender, at Byron Bay. Later that evening she arrived at an aunt's house at Byron Bay. She began drinking alcohol with her cousin; drowning her sorrows in relation to what had taken place with her boyfriend. The offender arrived later that evening. There was a plan in place for him to drive her to the airport so she could fly back to Sydney the following day. It is clear on all accounts that she consumed a large quantity of alcohol that evening, having around two and a half bottles of wine.

Later that night, the offender and the complainant departed from the house at Byron Bay and on the way to his residence at Ballina called at his girlfriend's house, near Lennox Head. He too was going through something of a break up with Clare Millar. At the house the complainant had another glass or so of wine and then they continued on to his unit in Ballina.

The complainant does not remember a great deal of what happened once they arrived at the offender's house but recalls going to bed fully clothed in a dress and underwear. She believed that she had fallen asleep on top of the sheets. It can be inferred from the evidence of phone calls made soon after, that she awoke at about 2am. She immediately did not feel that things were right and had a sense that someone had been having sex with her. As she woke, she thought that this was not possible because her boyfriend was not with her. Soon after she confronted the offender who had just finished having a shower. He admitted that they had sexual intercourse and that it should not have happened but told her that she had consented. She immediately became upset, demanded to know how he could do such a thing to her. He claimed that she had grabbed hold of his penis and put it between her legs and again asserted that it was not rape, as she had consented.

After that she called her mother and in a state of considerable distress, disclosed what had happened. There was immediate complaint made to her mother and subsequently to others. The offender took the phone at some point and began talking with the complainant's mother, that is his sister.

He was arrested by police later that morning. He conceded that sexual intercourse had taken place but with the complainant's consent. He had already made a voice recording, following the raising of the alarm by the complainant on his mobile phone, placing his account of what had taken place down as a record as soon as possible.


	
	It is convenient to consider first the ground concerned with the summing-up for reasons which follow.
	


Ground 2:   Unfair summing up


	
	The Applicant accepts that no complaint was made by his counsel at the trial about the summing up and that rule 4, therefore, applies. The Applicant submitted that the present ground was closely related to the ground based on an unreasonable verdict. The subject matter of both grounds was largely the same. That led to the result that, if the summing up was regarded as unfair, there would be a miscarriage of justice to justify the exception to rule 4’s application.
	
	
	The Applicant submitted that the summing up was unfair because of the repeated references by the Trial Judge to the Complainant having been asleep or unconscious without there being a balanced reference to the Applicant’s case which accepted that the Complainant fell asleep but asserted that she woke up at or shortly after the time he got into bed with her.
	
	
	Reference was made to the following passages:
	


A person does not consent to sexual intercourse if the person – the complainant - does not have the opportunity to consent to sexual intercourse, because she is unconscious or asleep. That is, in the most basic terms, what the Crown case or the evidence of the complainant is. She had fallen asleep and the next thing she knew, she had this feeling of something haven taken place and she confronted the accused. She says there was no consent because she was either asleep or unconscious or passed out and that she came to. … (pp. 12-13)

...

… As I understand it, they went to their separate rooms, each fell asleep and then the complainant woke up, she says to what she felt or what she believed had taken place and the confirmation of that by the accused. … (p. 13)

…

… The Crown case is based on what the complainant said about this and she said that she was passed out, that she was unconscious or asleep. Take your pick as to which of those things it was, but that is the account that she gave. … (p. 14)

…

… The complainant says she was asleep when this happened and it was not a case of saying anything could have happened but she was asleep, if you consider the circumstances shortly before she woke up. … (p. 16)

…

… You have, in terms of proving his actual knowledge, the Crown says, her evidence that she was asleep and that she woke up - asleep or passed out - and that he, from that, must have known that she was asleep and could not consent. (p 19)

…

… The Crown says that she was highly intoxicated and it might flow from that, that she was, as she said, asleep, woke up suddenly and became aware of what had happened. … (p. 22)


	
	The Applicant submitted that by reason of the Complainant’s lack of memory of the events of the night, that she did not volunteer that she was asleep and her acceptance of the fact that she may have been awake, these passages unfairly represented the evidence. In addition, the jury was not reminded of what was said to be her “relatively unusual” reaction to alcohol, namely that she could appear to be composed despite being very drunk and incapable of forming memories.
	
	
	Reference was made to what was said in Doyle v R; R v Doyle [2014] NSWCCA 4 at [409]-[410], Bin Radimin v R; Bin Zakhria v R [2013] NSWCCA 220; (2013) 235 A Crim R 244 at [66]-[67], R v Meher [2004] NSWCCA 355 at [83]-[85] and R v Sukkar [2005] NSWCCA 54 at [92]-[95] about the fairness and balance required from the trial judge in the summing up that puts the defence case fairly and adequately to the jury. These principles are not in doubt.
	
	
	A fair reading of the summing up does not indicate any lack of balance or a failure of the trial judge to put the Applicant’s case. The summing up includes the following matters in respect of his case and in respect of what the jury had to consider in terms of the Crown’s onus of proof.
	


(a)   You need to perhaps consider if she moved in a certain way to indicate consent - would she have done that thinking it was Joel her partner. (pp. 13-14);

(b)   The defence though say that in the way that she responded to the  accused - they point to what he says - that she indicated consent by touching him and taking his penis and putting it inside her; (p. 14)

(c)   What the accused then says is that on his recollection, his version of what took place, he was lying behind her and that she indicated consent and not by words it seems as Mr Crown submitted to you. Not a word was said: but by her physical actions when he was lying behind her and by moving his hand to a genital area, touching his genital area.  Taking out his penis and putting it inside her, along with the removal of clothes and so on, and afterwards sitting up and kissing him, is all evidence and an indication that she was in fact consenting. (pp. 14-15)

(d)   In considering this question [consent], on behalf of the accused reliance is placed on her evidence that she simply cannot rule anything in or out. How then does the Crown prove that there was a lack of consent - that she did not consent to this accused having sexual intercourse with her. (p. 15)

(e)   You perhaps might consider whether the Crown can exclude that she consented to sexual intercourse with her uncle but has forgotten that she did so in the time between giving consent and discovering the act of intercourse had taken place. (p. 15)

(f)   On the other hand, does the accused's version raise a reasonable doubt that she did in fact respond, that she knew it was him and she    has either chosen not to be frank about it or that she has actually forgotten consenting to him, her uncle, having sexual intercourse with her. I have put the evidence in a different way there, that is not to suggest that the accused has some onus of proof. The onus of proof rests with the Crown. (p. 16)

(g)   And again, I remind you that, in relation to all of that, on behalf of the accused, it is pointed out that she said she could not rule anything in or out. (p. 16)


	
	Contrary to the Applicant’s submission, there was no evidence that the Complainant had an unusual reaction to alcohol in the way described. There was evidence from the Complainant that when she became drunk she lost memories but that was entirely consistent with Dr Stevenson’s evidence who said the following in her evidence in chief:
	


Q. What sort of clinical effects could one expect with a blood alcohol concentration in that range?

A. You might see that the person is emotionally unstable, has poor sensory perception, so poor ability to see and hear. Impaired memory is definitely within that range and impaired - impaired ability to understand things and some incoordination and loss of balance is possible in that range as well.

Q. So impairment and loss of balance could, for example, include unsteadiness on feet, staggering, the sort of thing that we sometimes see—

A. Yes.

Q. --on the streets of Sydney on our televisions?

A. Yes, towards the higher range you might get some incoordination and staggering at that level.

Q. You talk about impaired memory and comprehension, is there a difference between impaired memory and loss of memory?

A. Yes, you know when we're talking about loss of memory, which is an alcohol related blackout that people sometimes get, you can get complete memory loss, where you don't remember anything from preceding times. Or you can get a fragmentary memory loss, where you can remember something happened but you can't remember the details of it. So impairment of memory really can encompass both of those things from complete blackout of memory to fragmentary blackout of memory.

…

Q. Impaired memory, including both fragmented memory and loss of memory would be possible?

A. That's correct.


	
	That did not demonstrate an unusual reaction to alcohol. It simply reinforced the conclusion, well-known to laypersons and professionals alike, that excessive drinking can impair memory. It was never suggested to Dr Stevenson that the way the Complainant reacted to alcohol, as reported by her and others, was in any way unusual.
	
	
	The one matter to which counsel for the Applicant at both the hearing and the appeal returned and emphasised was the Complainant’s lack of recollection about large portions of the evening and night. Nothing in the summing up, as the above passages demonstrate, suggests that the trial judge overlooked that matter. Her Honour clearly identified the issue for the jury. The view to which the jury must have come was not achieved by any unfairness or lack of balance in the summing up.
	
	
	I would reject this ground.
	


Ground 1:   Unreasonable verdict


	
	The principles concerning this ground were recently discussed by this Court in W v R [2014] NSWCCA 110 as follows:
	


[150]   The principles on which this ground is to be determined were reaffirmed by the majority of the High Court in SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; (2011) 243 CLR 400 in the following terms:

""[11] It is agreed between the parties that the relevant function to be performed by the Court of Criminal Appeal in determining an appeal, such as that of the applicant, is as stated in M v The Queen by Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ:

'Where, notwithstanding that as a matter of law there is evidence to sustain a verdict, a court of criminal appeal is asked to conclude that the verdict is unsafe or unsatisfactory, the question which the court must ask itself is whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty.'

[12] This test has been restated to reflect the terms of s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act. In MFA v The Queen McHugh, Gummow and Kirby JJ stated that the reference to 'unsafe or unsatisfactory' in M is to be taken as 'equivalent to the statutory formula referring to the impugned verdict as ""unreasonable"" or such as ""cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence"".'

[13] The starting point in the application of s 6(1) is that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, and the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses. However, the joint judgment in M went on to say:

'In most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced. It is only where a jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a court of criminal appeal that the court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred.'

Save as to the issue whether the Court of Criminal Appeal erred in not viewing a videotape of the complainant's police interview, to which reference will be made later in these reasons, this qualification is not relevant to the present matter."" (Citations omitted).

[151]   It is not enough for the verdict to be unreasonable that a review of the evidence shows only that it was possible for the jury (or in this case the trial judge) to reach a different conclusion. That was made clear by Hayne J in Libke v The Queen [2007] HCA 30; (2007) 230 CLR 559. In a passage with which Gleeson CJ and Heydon J agreed, his Honour made the following remarks:

""[113] It is clear that the evidence that was adduced at the trial did not all point to the appellant's guilt on this first count. But the question for an appellate court is whether it was open to the jury to be satisfied of guilt beyond reasonable doubt, which is to say whether the jury must, as distinct from might, have entertained a doubt about the appellant's guilt. It is not sufficient to show that there was material which might have been taken by the jury to be sufficient to preclude satisfaction of guilt to the requisite standard. In the present case, the critical question for the jury was what assessment they made of the whole of the evidence that the complainant and the appellant gave that was relevant to the issue of consent to the digital penetration that had occurred in the park. That evidence did not require the conclusion that the jury should necessarily have entertained a doubt about the appellant's guilt."" (Emphasis in the original, citations omitted).

[152]   However, it is not sufficient that there was evidence on which a jury could convict. So much is made clear in the passage from M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; (1994) 181 CLR 487, cited in SKA v The Queen supra at [13]. If, after giving full weight to the primacy of the jury, the court is left in reasonable doubts as to the verdicts, it is only where the jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt, the court can conclude there was no miscarriage of justice (see also MFA v The Queen [2002] HCA 53; (2002) 213 CLR 606 at [26] and [55]-[56]).


	
	Senior Counsel for the Applicant drew attention to a number of passages in the Complainant’s evidence to demonstrate not only that although she had no recollection of a number of events of the evening these events in fact took place. Senior Counsel then submitted that the jury could not properly infer from the fact that the Complainant had no memory of the matters that they had not occurred. In that regard the Applicant drew attention to what he said happened after he got into bed with the Complainant, namely, that she grabbed his hand and put it between her legs, she then put her hand on his side and down onto his penis and, after removal of their clothes she placed his penis between her legs. Those actions meant, therefore, that it was not open to the jury to find that the Applicant knew that the Complainant did not consent to intercourse.
	
	
	The Applicant submitted that the lack of memory of events which occurred or may have occurred raised the issue of the onus of proof on the Crown to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the Complainant did not consent and the Applicant knew that she did not consent.
	
	
	The case was largely a circumstantial one. The jury had available the Appellant’s ERISP and the recording made on his mobile phone on the morning of the incident. He did not give evidence at the trial. They had no evidence from the Complainant concerning what took place at the time of the sexual intercourse because she was not able to remember the incident at all. The jury was, therefore, required to draw inferences on all of the material before them. That material relevantly was as follows:
	


(1)   The Complainant’s account on awakening shortly after the incident including her early complaint;

(2)   The evidence of the hours before the incident when the Complainant and the Applicant were in each other’s company. There was no evidence of sexual interest by the Complainant in the Applicant.

(3)   During that evening the Applicant had been in her company long enough to know that she had consumed a considerable amount of alcohol at her cousin’s place, at Clare Millar’s place and then at the Applicant’s house, although in his ERISP the Applicant said he did not know she had drunk alcohol at his place. A bottle of red wine, partly drunk, was found near the bed in which the Complainant slept. The Applicant said it was not his wine.

(4)   The evidence from the Applicant’s former girlfriend, Clare Millar about a    conversation she and the Appellant had that afternoon where he    asked Ms Millar, “Do you think that she [the Complainant] will sleep in a    bed with me?”

(5)   The evidence of Dr Stevenson about the likely effect of the amount of    alcohol that the Complainant had consumed.

(6)   The evidence of the conversation at the house of the Complainant’s cousin Lucas where the Complainant expressed the view (in the presence of the Applicant) that the Applicant’s relationship with Clare Millar was “wrong” (as Lucas asserted she said) or “gross” (as her aunt Victoria reported it) because Clare was about the same age as the Complainant, and the Applicant was some 20 years older.


	
	In the first place, it seems clear that the jury rejected the Applicant’s account, given in his recording on his phone and in his ERISP, of what occurred. The enquiry is whether the jury must, not might, have entertained a doubt taking into account the circumstantial matters set out above. The Applicant submitted that because the Complainant’s evidence was that she “couldn’t rule anything in or out”, there was no sufficient evidence to prove a lack of consent. The jury, therefore, ought to have entertained a reasonable doubt.
	
	
	The Complainant’s agreement with the cross-examiner’s question that she couldn’t rule anything in or out cannot be viewed in isolation. When asked if she consented to the intercourse she said: “I would never ever consent to having sex with my uncle”. When viewed with the evidence of the Complainant’s relationship with the Applicant (as a confidante, he said) including the lack of any sexual interest in him, particularly during the hours leading up to the sexual intercourse, and her view about the age difference between him and his girlfriend (her contemporary), the jury could well have regarded her answer that she could not rule anything in or out as saying no more than she had repeatedly said, namely, that she could not remember very much of the night and nothing of the sexual intercourse.
	
	
	The Crown’s final address to the jury concentrated on the matter of recklessness on the Applicant’s part. He knew the way she viewed him and, particularly, that she had demonstrated no sexual interest in him. He knew from the conversation at Lucas’s place her view about the age difference between the Applicant and his girlfriend, and he knew the Complainant had consumed quite a lot of alcohol whereas he was completely sober. He also knew that she had fallen asleep on top of the sheets on the bed. The jury could well have concluded in the circumstances that he knew she had effectively passed out from her alcohol consumption.
	
	
	When those matters are considered along with the conversation Clare Millar reported with the Applicant earlier that day ([30](4) above), it was open to the jury to conclude that the Applicant was reckless as to whether the Complainant was consenting, alternatively, that he had no reasonable belief that she was consenting.
	
	
	On the Appellant’s own evidence in his ERISP he and the Complainant sat talking about his relationship with Clare, they apparently undertook some yoga, they then went to their own beds, a few hours later, he woke up, got into bed with the Complainant and without a word said, she initiated sexual contact between them. As the presiding judge said during the hearing of the appeal, the jury were entitled to say that it was absolutely extraordinary that there had been such a change of approach on her part that the jury could infer that she did not consent to what happened. It was open to the jury to conclude beyond reasonable doubt that the Appellant could not possibly have believed that she was consenting.
	
	
	No doubt a further consideration for the jury was whether the Complainant’s reaction to what happened was born out of regret at having done something under the influence of alcohol that she later regretted. They may well have reasoned, as the Crown suggested in his final address, that if she had engaged in sexual intercourse with her uncle and then regretted it because of how it might be seen inside and outside the family, she would more likely have made an arrangement with him to keep it their secret than make immediate complaint to her mother, leave his house hurriedly in the middle of the night with nowhere to go, and then report the matter to the police.
	
	
	The Appellant submitted that, given the Complainant’s lack of recollection of the events of the night, the jury’s verdict was consistent only with a reversal of the onus of proof. I took the submission to be one that asserted if the jury rejected the Appellant’s version in his recorded message and his ERISP they could only have reached a guilty verdict without proceeding to examine whether the Crown had nevertheless proved its case to the required standard. The Crown could not have done so because of the lack of recollection on the Complainant’s part.
	
	
	This submission ignores the significant circumstantial evidence and the consideration of it set out earlier. That evidence, taken with her statement that she would never have consented to have sex with her uncle, was entirely sufficient for the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that she did not consent and that either the Appellant was reckless as to whether she consented or that he had no reasonable grounds for thinking that she was consenting.
	
	
	I would reject this ground.
	
	
	As noted earlier, the Appellant was sentenced to a non-parole period of 20 months commencing 12 February 2014 with an additional term of 2 years. On 18 December 2014 the Appellant was released to bail pending the outcome of the appeal. He had, therefore, completed 10 months and 7 days of his sentence. He should be returned to custody to complete at least his non-parole period. The parties are agreed that he must serve a further minimum term of 9 months and 24 days commencing 4 June 2015 and expiring 27 March 2016. His additional term will expire on 27 March 2018.
	
	
	I propose the following orders:
	


1.   Grant leave to appeal.

2.   Dismiss the appeal.

3.   Direct that the Appellant be returned to custody to serve the balance of his non-parole period of 9 months and 24 days commencing 4 June 2015 and expiring 27 March 2016 with an additional term expiring on 27 March 2018.

2703298,Jubraeel v R [2015] NSWCCA 131,"Judgment


	
	MACFARLAN JA: Between 10 and 27 February 2014, the applicant, Mr Marwan Jubraeel, was tried before a judge and jury for the murder of Colin Wick on 23 July 2011. The jury returned a verdict of guilty. The applicant appealed against his conviction on the grounds that the trial judge failed to give the jury adequate directions in relation to an alibi on which he relied and that the verdict was unsafe and unsatisfactory. By the latter ground the applicant sought to invoke the Court’s power under s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) to allow an appeal against conviction where the court considers that the jury’s verdict is “unreasonable, or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence”. Leave to appeal is required in respect of that ground (see s 5(1)(b) of the Criminal Appeal Act). I refer to Mr Jubraeel as the “applicant” rather than the appellant as, for reasons appearing below at [24], he also needed leave to rely on his first ground of appeal.
	


The course of the trial


	
	The Crown opened its case to the jury as follows:
	



	
	At about 9.30 to 9.40 pm on Saturday 23 July 2011, the deceased, Mr Colin Wick, was at the home in Canley Heights that he shared with Ms Eleanor Attard. They heard several loud bangs in the vicinity of the front of their house. When Mr Wick pulled aside a curtain that had been across a sliding glass door, he was shot in the chest. He died of the wound.
	
	
	When Mr Wick pulled the curtain aside, Ms Attard saw that the glass of the door had been shattered and that three men were standing side by side on top of a bench that was located outside the door. One of the men had his hand out pointing a gun directly ahead. The other two stood beside him. The gun was fired almost immediately into the chest of Mr Wick, without a word being said. Ms Attard said that the men were each dressed in dark clothing with balaclavas covering their heads.
	
	
	On the arrival of police, the neighbours directed them to a white Toyota Corolla car parked in a nearby street. Subsequent testing identified the applicant’s fingerprints on the vehicle, and DNA consistent with that of the applicant inside the car. The Crown’s evidence, when called, also indicated that the car had a flat battery and that the applicant had had access to firearms and ammunition prior to the shooting.
	
	
	When questioned by the police on 8 August 2011 the applicant said that at the time of the shooting he had been at the flat of a friend known to him as Miss G.
	
	
	On 3 September 2011 a friend of the applicant, Ms Sinem Bas, attended the Green Valley police station to provide information about the shooting that led to Mr Wick’s death. In a recorded interview on 3 November 2011, Ms Bas told the police about a conversation that occurred on 24 July 2011 during which the applicant told her that he was at the Canley Heights house at the time of the shooting.
	
	
	The Crown contended that the applicant was part of a joint criminal enterprise, that is, irrespective of which of the three persons fired the shot that killed Mr Wick, they were each guilty of murder because they were present and participated in the offence with reckless indifference to human life.
	



	
	After the Crown’s opening, the applicant’s counsel told the jury that the applicant’s case was simple: “[w]e were not there, we had nothing to do with the shooting of this man” (transcript p 28).
	
	
	In its case, the Crown also tendered an ERISP transcript of a police interview with the applicant on 11 January 2012 in which the applicant denied involvement in Mr Wick’s murder but, on legal advice, declined to answer many other questions. He did however say that on 23 July 2011 he was at Miss G’s unit from the afternoon until “night”, apart from going out to a service station for some food (pp 22-23). He also confirmed the correctness of a police statement that he had made on 8 August 2011 (pp 9-10). That statement was tendered by the applicant’s counsel to give the jury “a complete picture” of what the applicant had told the police and not as the evidence of the truth of its contents (transcript p 474). The ERISP transcript was however tendered by the Crown without restriction and was accordingly evidence of the matters asserted in it.
	
	
	In the police statement the applicant referred to his friend Randy Younan’s purchase of the Toyota Corolla on 23 July 2011 and their driving of it that day. He said that he went to Miss G’s unit at about 3.30 to 3.40 pm and stayed there until about 1.00 am, along with others including his friend Ollie (p 4).
	


Ms Bas’ evidence


	
	Ms Bas said that she and the applicant were close friends and on a number of occasions on the evening of 23 July 2011 she had attempted unsuccessfully to contact the applicant (transcript p 74, corroborated by telephone records). She was worried about him and when they met the next day she asked him something to the effect of “Where were you? What were you doing?” On that occasion:
	


“He said that he and a couple of other people had went to someone’s house where they had broke in, and the person who had answered the door was shot at and they – him and whoever was there took off, and the car that they wanted to get in had broken down on them, so they took off by foot and everyone hid somewhere, I don’t know exactly where. And Marwan didn’t have a gun on him from what he had told me so I don’t know who did but, obviously, someone had one that – a man did get shot, but he told me that he didn’t have one and that he wasn’t the shooter, and he also told me that he hid near or in the creek, I’m not exactly sure” (transcript pp 77-78).


	
	After seeing a television news broadcast referring to a nearby shooting, the death of a person and “police looking around the creek and the area being closed off” (transcript p 80), Ms Bas, on 3 September 2011, went with her sister to the Green Valley police station to report her conversation with the applicant. On 3 November 2011 she returned to participate in a recorded interview. When asked in evidence-in-chief whether she was still friends with the applicant as at 3 September 2011 she said that “[i]t was pretty complicated … [i]t was like on and off” (transcript p 81).
	
	
	After the following question and answer, the Crown Prosecutor was given leave under s 38 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) to cross-examine Ms Bas in relation to parts of the recorded interview:
	


“Q. Did [the applicant] tell you that he had anything with him at the time that he went to hide?

A. No and I don’t even remember but from what I recall like a weapon or something” (transcript p 82) (sic).


	
	Ms Bas’ evidence was that she was unable to recall most of what she had said in the recorded interview. At one point she was asked whether she remembered a particular series of questions and answers saying: “[o]bviously like not exactly, it’s been a while ago now but, to be very honest with you, the only thing that is concrete in my head is what I explained to you before, I just remember when he was present at the house, he wasn’t the shooter and everyone fled off and – ” (transcript pp 91-92).
	
	
	Ms Bas was cross-examined in detail about her relationship with the applicant and her attitude to being unable to contact him on the night of 23 July 2011. She rejected the suggestion that the reason that she remained friends with the applicant was that he had not told her that he had been involved in the shooting (transcript p 110).
	
	
	She accepted the proposition that the applicant “never told [her] about having a firearm and a balaclava” but was referred to the following question and answer in the transcript of her Record of Interview:
	


“Q. Okay, so it is fair to say what you were told, you were told he had a firearm and a balaclava?

A. Oh, well that’s what I was told but I don’t know” (transcript p 113).


	
	When confronted with the inconsistency, she said that she could not remember but “[i]f it is said there, then – it is written there, it means I obviously did say it” (transcript p 114).
	
	
	She was then referred to other parts of the Record of Interview in which she was asked whether the applicant had told her that he had a weapon and responded: “I think so” and, at another point, “I don’t remember” (transcript pp 114, 115 and 116). Later in the interview, she said “I’m not sure if they were all armed or if it was only [the] one who was responsible for the shooting” (transcript p 117).
	


Alibi evidence


	
	The Crown called a number of the applicant’s friends and associates to give evidence relating to the circumstances of the day. The Crown’s written submissions on appeal gave compelling reasons why the evidence of two of these friends, Mr Manwol Khamis and Mr Esho Esho, should not be regarded as alibi evidence of any significance. On appeal, the applicant did not contend otherwise and instead focused solely on the evidence of Mr Oliver Merza, the “Ollie” referred to in the applicant’s statement of 8 August 2011, evidence (see [5] above).
	
	
	Mr Merza gave evidence that he helped Mr Younan purchase the Toyota Corolla on 23 July 2011 (ibid) and that he was at Miss G’s unit from around 11.00 am to noon on that day until the following morning (transcript p 114). In cross-examination Mr Merza said that the applicant came to the unit with Mr Esho in the afternoon on 23 July 2011, that Mr Esho left for a short period in the evening but returned and then left again at about 12.30 am the next morning, and that the applicant stayed all night and left the following afternoon (transcript pp 417-418).
	
	
	After the Crown Prosecutor completed her re-examination, the trial judge said to her in the absence of the jury that the Crown’s lack of cross-examination on the evidence of Mr Merza that was inconsistent with the Crown’s case would be the subject of comment to the jury (transcript pp 419-420). The Crown Prosecutor then sought, but was refused, leave to cross-examine Mr Merza. The trial judge’s reasons for rejecting the application concluded as follows:
	


“It seems to me that fundamentally there are two aspects; firstly, were it not for the intervention of the Court this witness would have already been excused. Secondly, the Crown was on notice that the accused said this witness was with him at the time of the commission of the offence. Thirdly, being on notice the Crown did not seek to adduce from the witness evidence inconsistent with that proposition.

In all of the circumstances it seems to me leave ought not be granted to reopen the re-examination and to cross-examine under s38. I so rule” (transcript, 21 February 2014, p 3).


	
	The applicant did not give an alibi notice under s 150 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW). However the applicant’s police statement put the Crown on notice of the alibi. Given that the Crown did not contend that a notice should have been given, I express no opinion as to whether that should have occurred.
	


The applicant’s case


	
	The applicant did not give evidence or call any other person to give evidence.
	


Counsels’ addresses


	
	In address, the Crown Prosecutor referred to Mr Merza’s evidence but not to the absence of challenge to it (transcript p 524).
	
	
	The applicant’s counsel described the Crown’s case as almost totally reliant on the evidence of Ms Bas, which he submitted should be rejected (transcript pp 537-538). He focused particularly on inconsistencies in Ms Bas’ answers in evidence and in her recorded interview about whether the applicant told her that he had a firearm and a balaclava at the time of the shooting. He also relied on Mr Merza’s evidence, stressing it was “not contested” and that Mr Merza was “not even questioned about it” (transcript pp 538-539).
	


The Summing-Up


	
	In his Summing-Up the trial judge repeatedly instructed the jury that in order to return a guilty verdict it had to be satisfied that the Crown had proved its case beyond reasonable doubt (for example pp 7, 12, 15 17, 18, 20, 21, 31, 43-44, 49, 50 and 53). His Honour specifically directed the jury that it had to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant was at the Canley Heights address on 23 July 2011 when the shooting occurred, was one of the three persons wearing balaclavas (p 12) and “was a participant in the commission of the crime as part of a joint criminal enterprise with the other persons” (p 31). His Honour referred to this as the “fundamental issue” in the trial (ibid) and directed the jury that if it did not accept Ms Bas’ evidence that the applicant told her that he was present at the time of the shooting, it must return a verdict of not guilty of murder and manslaughter (pp 43 and 44). The jury was given a hard copy of his Honour’s Summing-Up.
	
	
	His Honour also referred to Mr Merza’s evidence that the applicant was in Miss G’s unit with him at the time that the murder was said to have occurred and directed the jury that when determining whether to believe Mr Merza it was entitled to take into account the Crown’s lack of examination and cross-examination of him on this topic (p 8).
	
	
	The applicant’s trial counsel did not request the trial judge to give any further directions to the jury.
	


Ground 1: the absence of specific alibi directions


	
	On appeal, the applicant’s counsel acknowledged that because the applicant’s trial counsel did not request that the trial judge give any further directions, the applicant required the leave of this Court under r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules 1952 (NSW) to advance this ground of appeal. In light of a trial counsel’s duty to object to evidence and seek redirections following the Summing-Up, leave under r 4 is not lightly given. Obtaining leave requires an applicant to satisfy the court that the failure to give the jury a particular direction (or other error) has caused a miscarriage of justice (Papakosmas v The Queen [1999] HCA 37; 196 CLR 297 at [72] per McHugh J), or at least that there is a possibility that that is the case (R v Roberts [2001] NSWCCA 163 NSWLR 138 at [55] per Howie J).
	
	
	In ARS v R [2011] NSWCCA 266, Bathurst CJ provided the following summary of important considerations in relation to r 4:
	


""148 The requirements of r 4 are not mere technicalities. The Criminal Appeal Act does not exist to enable an accused who has been convicted on one set of issues to have a new trial under a new set of issues which could or should have been raised at the first trial: R v ITA [2003] NSWCCA 174; (2003) 139 A Crim R 340 at [94], citing with approval R v Fuge [2001] NSWCCA 208; (2001) 123 A Crim R 310, 319. See also Darwiche v R [2011] NSWCCA 62 at [170].

The appellant must establish that he or she has lost a real chance (or a

chance fairly open) of being acquitted: Picken v R [2007] NSWCCA 319 at [20]-[21].

A failure by counsel to take objection or to raise an issue on summing-up may be explicable by the fact that counsel said nothing hoping to gain an advantage at a later stage, or that counsel took no objection as, in the atmosphere of the trial, counsel saw no injustice as to what was being done: Germakian v R [2007] NSWCCA 373; (2007) 70 NSWLR 467 at [10]-[13]; Sanchez v R [2009] NSWCCA 171; (2009) 196 A Crim R 472 at [58]-[61].

An unexplained failure to take the point at the trial is usually a reasonably reliable indicator of the fairness and adequacy of the summing-up: Tekely v R [2007] NSWCCA 75 at [88], [130].""


	
	Before determining whether leave should be granted, I turn to consider the merits of the proposed ground of appeal by reference to the seven matters listed in the applicant’s Notice of Appeal as particulars of the ground.
	


“(i) His Honour failed to direct the jury that … if they accepted the alibi they were obliged to acquit”


	
	The applicant submitted in effect that the following extract from the Judicial Commission of New South Wales’ Criminal Trial Courts Bench Book suggested direction (at paragraph [6-000]) should have been given:
	


“The Crown must establish beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was at [the scene of the crime] at the relevant time. The Crown cannot do so if there is any reasonable possibility that the accused was at [somewhere else, according to the alibi evidence] at that time, as asserted by the alibi evidence. The Crown must therefore remove or eliminate any reasonable possibility that the accused was at [somewhere else, according to the alibi evidence] at the relevant time, and also persuade you, on the evidence on which the Crown relies, that beyond reasonable doubt the accused was at [the scene of the crime] at that time. If the Crown fails to remove or eliminate that reasonable possibility, you must acquit the accused”.


	
	The applicant’s submissions quoted an earlier version of the suggested direction. I have quoted that which is current.
	
	
	The Bench Book states that the suggested alibi directions are intended to be consistent with R v Amyouni (unrep, 18/2/88, NSWCCA), R v Steeden (unrep, 19/8/94, NSWCCA) and R v Kanaan [2005] NSWCCA 385 at [135]. I refer to these and other decisions below.
	
	
	In Amyouni, the trial judge’s directions in relation to the accused’s alibi defence included the following:
	


“If you accept [the] alibi evidence it is likely that you would have a reasonable doubt on the Crown case but if you do not accept the alibi evidence you must still look to see if you are satisfied on the Crown case that it has made out those elements of which I told you to your satisfaction beyond a reasonable doubt. In short, the failure of an alibi does not necessarily prove the Crown case” (pp 1-2).


	
	This Court found that the first part of the direction was in error because if the jury was satisfied that the alibi was reliable, it was bound to acquit the accused. Using the word “likely” therefore understated the position.
	
	
	The Court also found that the latter part of the direction was in error because it presented the jury with only two alternative situations (acceptance or rejection of the alibi evidence) when a third existed, namely, one in which the jury doubted the force of the alibi evidence but did not either accept or reject it. In this situation, the jury should consider the whole of the evidence, “giving to the claimed alibi such significance as the jury might think it deserved in the overall factual context” (p 2), to determine whether the Crown had proved its case beyond reasonable doubt.
	
	
	Neither of these errors occurred in the present case. First, the trial judge directed the jury that it must acquit if it was not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant was present at the scene of the murder (see [21] above). From this, the jury would have understood that if it accepted the alibi evidence it must acquit the accused. Secondly, the trial judge did not present the jury with two alternatives. Rather, his Honour repeatedly emphasised that the applicant’s presence must be proved beyond reasonable doubt. The trial judge did not, and was not asked to, distinguish between a situation in which the jury rejected the alibi evidence and one in which it simply had a doubt about it.
	
	
	In Amyouni, whilst agreeing with Street CJ (with whom Slattery CJ at CL also agreed), Roden J added:
	


“It seems to me that in every case where that situation is met, there are three possibilities, all three of which should be explained to the jury.

One is that they accept the alibi, in which event they would be obliged to acquit. The second is that they reject the alibi, in which case they would not necessary convict but must assess the evidence as a whole. The third possibility is that although they do not accept the alibi, they also do not reject it in the sense that they regard it as something which could reasonably be true. In that event also, in such a case, they must acquit.

In my view, it is the failure of the learned trial judge to refer to that third possibility that leads to the orders which are proposed and with which I agree” (p 3).


	
	In R v Harland (unrep, 22/8/90, NSWCCA), Campbell J (with whom Meagher JA and Newman J agreed) referred, with approval, to Roden J’s observation but pointed out that a trial judge was not required to “adhere to a rigid formula”, nor to refer to each of the matters to which Roden J referred if the case’s particular circumstances made it unnecessary to do so (p 5). The Summing-Up in Harland would have left the jury with the impression that if it rejected the accused’s alibi evidence it should convict, thus leaving unstated the jury’s obligation to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the accused’s guilt upon the evidence as a whole, even if it rejected the alibi evidence (p 4). This error did not occur in the present case.
	
	
	In Steeden, this Court stated that “[it] is clearly desirable for a judge summing-up in a case in which an alibi defence is raised to approach the matter in the fashion considered by Roden J in Regina v Amyouni” (p 4). However, despite the absence of an Amyouni-type direction by the trial judge in that case, this Court considered that the directions at trial were sufficient in light of the “clear and repeated directions on the onus of proof and the standard of proof” (p 5).
	
	
	In R v Skaf [2004] NSWCCA 37 (paragraphs [1]-[7] and [187]-[287] only reported in 60 NSWLR 86), this Court concluded:
	


“105 Unlike [in] Amyouni, the judge did not invite the jury to look only at the Crown case to the exclusion of everything else in the event of rejecting the alibi. His Honour made it quite clear that the onus of proof lay on the Crown in all matters”.


	
	In these circumstances, the Court found that the directions were adequate notwithstanding the absence of formalised alibi directions.
	
	
	A similar approach was taken in Kanaan in which this Court found that, despite the absence of any formal alibi direction, the trial judge had made it clear “in the context of directions concerning the onus and standard of proof, that any reasonable possibility that the alibi was true had to be eliminated before the applicant could be convicted” and that the Summing-Up would have ensured that the jury understood that it could not draw “a conclusion of guilt as a direct consequence of rejecting the alibi” (at [136], [137]).
	
	
	Maxwell P’s observation as follows in R v Merrett [2007] VSCA 1 (Chernov JA and Habersberger AJA agreeing) encapsulates the effect of the abovementioned cases, although it should not be taken as discouraging the giving of explicit alibi directions where the trial judge considers it appropriate:
	


“22 … When the Judge says that the Crown must establish beyond reasonable doubt that the accused committed the offence, it is equivalent to saying that the Crown must prove that there is no reasonable possibility that the accused is innocent or – in the case of an alibi defence – no reasonable possibility that the accused was elsewhere at the time the offence was committed. For the Judge to have told the jury that, while neither accepting nor rejecting the alibi evidence, they might conclude nevertheless that there was a reasonable possibility that the alibi evidence was true would merely have been to restate the direction he had given – repeatedly – on the standard of proof …”.


	
	In the present case, the trial judge directed the jury that it should acquit the applicant unless it was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he was present when the shooting occurred. In these circumstances an explicit statement that the jury should acquit if it accepted the alibi was unnecessary because it would have been obvious to the jury from the direction given that it should do this.
	


“(ii) His Honour failed to direct the jury that if they rejected the alibi they would not necessarily convict but must assess the evidence as a whole”


	
	His Honour did not at any stage suggest that if the jury rejected the alibi, it should necessarily convict the applicant (compare R v Steeden referred to in [36] above). Rather, his Honour’s repeated direction that the Crown must prove its case beyond reasonable doubt (see [21] above) indicated to the jury that this was not the position.
	


“(iii) His Honour failed to direct the jury that if they did not accept the alibi or reject it in the sense that they regarded it as something which could reasonably be true, they must acquit”


	
	Again, this direction was unnecessary as his Honour made it clear to the jury that if it had a reasonable doubt about the applicant’s presence at the scene of the shooting, it was required to return a verdict of not guilty.
	


“(iv) His Honour [erred in] fail[ing] to direct the jury that the Crown must disprove the alibi”


	
	His Honour’s repeated references to the onus of proof made it clear to the jury that, in order for it to convict, it had to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant was present at the scene of the shooting (ibid). This made it clear to the jury that if it considered that there was a reasonable possibility that the alibi evidence was correct it should conclude that the Crown had not discharged its onus of proof.
	


“(v) His Honour failed to give the jury any or any adequate directions as to the fact that the [applicant’s] alibi was supported by a Crown witness”


	
	The trial judge’s Summing-Up referred to Mr Merza’s alibi evidence that the applicant was with him at Miss G’s unit at the time of the shooting (p 6). The jury was aware that Mr Merza was a Crown witness because it knew that the applicant did not call any witnesses. His Honour’s limited reference to the evidence was sufficient considering the applicant’s counsel’s reliance on the evidence in his address (see [21] above) and the absence of a request by that counsel for the trial judge to supplement his Summing-Up.
	


“(vi) His Honour failed to comment or give the jury any warning on the fact that the evidence of Merza was not challenged by the Crown”


	
	His Honour’s Summing-Up referred to the Crown’s lack of cross-examination of Mr Merza and told the jury that it was entitled to take that into account in determining Mr Merza’s “believability or his accuracy” (p 8). Again, this was adequate in light of the applicant’s counsel’s reliance in address on the absence of challenge to Mr Merza’s evidence and of any request to the trial judge to supplement his Summing-Up.
	


“(vii) His Honour failed to give the jury any or any adequate warning as to the limited use they could make of the evidence concerning persons and weapons at [Miss] G’s flat”


	
	The trial judge gave the jury detailed directions concerning Miss G’s oral evidence immediately after it was given. The Crown’s written submissions on appeal summarised the directions as follows:
	


“a.   The fundamental issue in the trial was whether the Crown could prove beyond reasonable doubt that the Applicant was one of the three males at the scene when the Deceased was fatally shot and,

b.   The evidence of Miss G is evidence that the Applicant had access to a weapon of a similar kind to the type that [was] used or described [as] being at the scene of the fatal shooting of the Deceased but, that evidence cannot be used to prove directly that the Applicant was the person at the scene and,

c.   Further, the circumstance that the Applicant had access to such a weapon cannot be used … to reason that he was more likely to have been at the scene (i.e. proscribing impermissible propensity reasoning) and,

d.   … that the Crown case relied upon the admissions to Ms Bas to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the Applicant was at the scene of the fatal shooting, and the evidence of the Applicant having access to guns was put and is only available for the jury to render her evidence more believable and,

e.   It is not permissible to use the evidence of Miss G to reason that the Applicant had access to a weapon therefore he committed the murder because that ‘just doesn’t follow’ and that is why those directions were being given just after the evidence had been heard”.


	
	His Honour said that he would probably give the directions again in his Summing-Up but he did not do so. In my view, the directions that his Honour gave were adequate and, given that the applicant’s counsel did not request that they be repeated in the Summing-Up, it was unnecessary that that occur.
	


Conclusion on Ground 1


	
	For the reasons that I have given, the applicant’s submissions in relation to Ground 1 should be rejected. The fact that none of the points were taken by trial counsel strongly suggests that he did not perceive the directions now under consideration to be necessary to avoid unfairness to the applicant (see [24]- [25] above). I would refuse leave to the applicant to rely upon Ground 1.
	


Ground 2: “the verdict is unsafe and unsatisfactory”


	
	As noted earlier, this ground of appeal seeks to invoke the Court’s powers under s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act. In determining such a ground, this Court must make “an independent assessment of the evidence, both as to its sufficiency and its quality” and determine “whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty” (SKA at [14], [11] quoting M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; 181 CLR 487 at [25], [21]). The “central question” to be answered in making such an independent assessment is whether the court is satisfied that the applicant was guilty of the offences (SKA at [20]).
	
	
	In the present case, the Crown’s case depended on the jury accepting Ms Bas’ admission evidence. The Crown accepted on appeal that whilst there was other evidence that was supportive of its case, for example the fingerprint and DNA evidence, that other evidence could not have justified the applicant’s conviction in the absence of Ms Bas’ evidence. The trial therefore turned on Ms Bas’ credibility and reliability. As a result, the jury’s advantage of having heard and seen the witnesses is particularly significant and must be given full weight (Griffiths v R [2014] NSWCCA 60 at [4]; see also SKA (at [13]) and M v The Queen at 494). Such weight diminishes or disappears if the jury was not properly instructed but that is not the case here. For the reasons that I have given above, the only complaints made about the trial judge’s instructions to the jury are without merit.
	
	
	The particular matters advanced by the applicant to found his submission that the jury’s verdict is “unsafe and unsatisfactory” were as follows:
	


“(i) Evidence was tendered by the Crown in the form of the [applicant’s] statement to police and his Record of Interview which supported his alibi for the offence.”


	
	As noted in [4] above, the applicant’s police statement of 8 August 2011 was not tendered as evidence of the truth of its contents. However the Crown’s tender of his Record of Interview was not so limited and the document was accordingly evidence of the truth of its contents. In it, the applicant is recorded as asserting that he was at Miss G’s unit on the night in question but, importantly, that he left the unit for an unidentified period in the evening to obtain food from a service station.
	


“(ii) This alibi evidence in the statement, confirmed in the Record of Interview, was provided more than two years before the [applicant’s] trial. Notwithstanding this early raising of alibi, the prosecuting authorities produced no direct evidence in contradiction of the [applicant’s] alibi.”


	
	Although not evidence of the truth of its contents, the applicant’s police statement did put the Crown on notice of the applicant’s alibi defence and that Mr Merza’s evidence may be able to support it.
	
	
	The jury was well aware that the Crown did not call a witness to contradict Mr Merza’s alibi evidence and no doubt took that fact into account.
	


“(iii) The [applicant’s] alibi was supported at trial by a Crown witness, Oliver Merza”;

“(iv) The alibi evidence of Merza was unchallenged by the Crown”


	
	Mr Merza’s evidence was required to be, and no doubt was, considered by the jury in determining whether the Crown had established its case beyond reasonable doubt. As noted above (at [20], [22]) the applicant’s trial counsel and the trial judge referred to that evidence being unchallenged.
	


(vi) The jury was not properly instructed as to the applicant’s alibi defence, as to the lack of challenge to the evidence of Mr Merza and as to Miss G’s evidence concerning the applicant’s access to weapons and ammunition


	
	I have earlier rejected the applicant’s contentions that the jury was not properly instructed.
	


“(v) The evidence of Ms Bas, which was not direct evidence as to the [applicant’s] whereabouts at the time of the offence, contained many contradictions and defects”


	
	The applicant’s counsel did not elaborate on this submission but it was no doubt intended, at least principally, as a reference to the inconsistent answers that Ms Bas gave in her recorded interview and in her evidence about whether the applicant told her that he had a firearm and a balaclava with him at the time of the shooting (see [6] to [13] above).
	
	
	However, it is not particularly remarkable that Ms Bas gave different answers at different times about whether the applicant told her that he had a firearm and balaclava with him at the shooting. From Ms Bas’ perspective that question could well have been of limited significance, bearing in mind that she did not at any time suggest that she thought the applicant himself fired the fatal shot. If of limited significance it would not be surprising that her recollection about it might have been confused or uncertain. What can be inferred to have been crucial from Ms Bas’ point of view is that the applicant told her that he had been a participant in a shooting incident that she had later learned resulted in a person’s death. Her recollection of this did not waiver. Such inconsistencies and uncertainties as there are in her answers concerning the details of what the applicant told her do not lead me to have a reasonable doubt as to the truthfulness or reliability of her evidence on this critical issue. It was entirely open to the jury to take the same view, which it undoubtedly did.
	


Conclusion on Ground 2


	
	Having conducted the requisite independent assessment of the record of the trial and giving full weight to the verdict of guilty returned by the properly instructed jury, I am not left with any reasonable doubt about the applicant’s guilt of the offence of which he was convicted. On my reading of the transcript, Ms Bas’ evidence was compelling and, notwithstanding Mr Merza’s alibi evidence, it justified the jury’s conclusion that the Crown proved its case against the applicant beyond reasonable doubt.
	
	
	The fact that Ms Bas’ evidence to the police about her conversation with the applicant contained an accurate reference to the Toyota Corolla escape vehicle having “broken down” when that occurrence was not referred to in any of the television reports of the shooting and could not, on the evidence, have been known to Ms Bas otherwise than as a result of speaking to the applicant, is particularly supportive.
	
	
	It is also important that in his Record of Interview the applicant stated that he had left Miss G’s unit for a period on the evening in question (see [4] above), which contradicted Mr Merza’s evidence that he was at the unit throughout the evening (see [15] above). This severely diminished the value to the applicant’s case of Mr Merza’s alibi evidence.
	
	
	For these reasons, I do not consider that Ground 2 has any merit. Accordingly, it is rejected.
	


Orders


	
	In light of my conclusion that neither ground of appeal sought to be relied on has any merit, I propose the following orders:
	



	
	Decline to grant to the applicant leave under r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules to rely on Ground 1 in his Notice of Appeal.
	
	
	Grant to the applicant leave to appeal to rely on Ground 2 in his Notice of Appeal.
	
	
	Dismiss the appeal.
	



	
	JOHNSON J: I agree with the reasons and proposed orders of Macfarlan JA. With respect to Ground 2, having conducted the necessary independent assessment of the trial, I am left with no reasonable doubt of the applicant's guilt of the murder of Colin Wick.
	
	
	RS HULME AJ: I agree with the orders proposed by Macfarlan JA and with his Honour's reasons.

2703300,Cowan v R (No 2) [2015] NSWCCA 134,"Judgment


	
	THE COURT: On 29 May 2015 this Court delivered judgment in Cowan v R [2015] NSWCCA 118. The effect of the orders made by the Court on that occasion was to impose a sentence of 3 years imprisonment upon the applicant, comprising a non-parole period of 1 year and 10 months expiring on 2 July 2015, and a balance of term of 1 year and 2 months expiring on 2 September 2016.
	
	
	Section 50 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 is in the following terms:
	


50 Making of parole orders by court

(1) When a court imposes a sentence of imprisonment for a term of 3 years or less, being a sentence that has a non-parole period, the court must make an order directing the release of the offender on parole at the end of the non-parole period.

(2) A parole order may be made under this section even though at the time it is made it appears that the offender may not be eligible for release at the end of the non-parole period because of some other sentence to which the offender is subject.

(3) The failure of a court to comply with the requirements of this section with respect to a sentence does not invalidate the sentence.


	
	It has been drawn to the Court’s attention that no order was made pursuant to s. 50 when judgment was delivered. The Solicitor for the applicant now seeks such an order, the making of which is not opposed by the Crown.
	
	
	Accordingly, the further order of the Court is as follows:
	



	
	Pursuant to s. 50(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 the Court directs the release of the applicant at the expiration of his non-parole period on 2 July 2015.

2703312,Dowling v R [2015] NSWDC 205,"Judgment


	
	Ruth Sumpner lived in a house owned by Gail Dowling. Gail Dowling herself lived nearby. Hence they were neighbours as well as being in a landlord and tenant relationship. They fell out. I do not need to dwell on the circumstances but it became serious enough for Ruth Sumpner to approach the Local Court for an apprehended violence order. That order was granted by his Honour Magistrate McCosker on 13 October 2014.
	
	
	Just over a month later, on 25 November 2014, something happened on the property where the two houses were. It led to a complaint to the police by Ruth Sumpner. That in turn led to Ms Dowling being arrested and charged with two offences.
	
	
	The first offence was against s 14(1) of the Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act 2007. It was said that Ms Dowling knowingly contravened a prohibition or restriction specified in the apprehended violence order which had been made against her in the previous months. The second charge was under s 13(1) of the same act. It specified that Ms Dowling had intimidated Ms Sumpner with the intention of causing her to fear physical or mental harm.
	
	
	The case came before Magistrate McCosker in the Local Court here in Taree on Monday 13 April 2015. After hearing the evidence and submissions his Honour found Ms Dowling guilty of both offences.
	
	
	Ms Dowling has appealed to this Court from her convictions on those offences. There is no fresh evidence. I have read the transcript of the evidence before his Honour as well as the exhibits. In addition I have looked at a physical exhibit which comprised a mobile phone.
	
	
	When a person appeals in a case like this, the District Court judge hears the case afresh and makes up his or her own mind about whether or not he or she is satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the charges. The judge pays due deference to the judgment of the magistrate who was in a position to assess the demeanour of witnesses as a source of assessment of their credibility.
	
	
	I have been assisted by Mr A Barber of counsel, along with his written submissions and by Mr A Baker, the solicitor for the respondent to the appeal who is the Direct of Public Prosecutions.
	
	
	In summary the prosecution case is that Ms Dowling, despite the apprehended violence order, approached the house of Ms Sumpner and looked at Ms Sumpner through a bedroom window. That action was said to be in breach of the clause numbered 13 in the apprehended violence order which provided that Ms Dowling “must not enter or loiter about the premises at which the protected person may from time to time reside”.
	
	
	First I should determine, as Mr Baker correctly observed, what happened. Despite a suggestion that Ms Dowling may have mounted a veranda surrounding Ms Sumpner’s house, an examination of the evidence shows that that did not occur. Not only that, I accept Mr Barber’s submission that the only source of evidence that his client was standing and looking at Ms Sumpner was her response to a leading question. Under cross-examination, and to her credit, as Mr Baker pointed out Ms Sumpner made it clear that Ms Dowling “continued walking after looking through” and that “she didn’t stop”. Mr Barber’s submission, in those circumstances and by reference to some of the descriptions given of his client’s actions being a glance, was that nothing more had occurred than a passing glance by his client towards Ms Sumpner’s house.
	
	
	Mr Barber argued that that action could not amount to intimidating Ms Sumpner “with the intention of causing the other person to fear physical or mental harm.” That would need to be proved beyond reasonable doubt if she is to be found guilty of the offence against s13 of the Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act.
	
	
	Mr Barber took me to the definition of intimidation which is contained in s 7 of the Act. He argued that the acknowledged glance by Ms Dowling could amount to harassment which is one of the meanings of intimidation. However, as Mr Barber pointed out, this was an isolated act. There was evidence of other events between the two women, but as Mr Baker correctly pointed out, that evidence was relevant only to context. Mr Barber argued that that same evidence must be limited to context. Indeed, he submitted more - that it was not admissible. But he went on to point out that s7(2) means that such evidence of other events cannot be taken into account. That is because s 7(2) allows the Court “to have regard to any pattern of violence”.
	
	
	I agree that the evidence of other acts did not amount to violence. Mr Baker pointed out that s 9(3)(d) envisaged that domestic violence extends beyond physical violence. The trouble with that argument is that, as Mr Barber pointed out, this is not a domestic violence offence. It is a personal violence offence. The object of the act in relation to personal violence, which is contained in s 10, does not contain the same distinction.
	
	
	I would not be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that any of the behaviour of Ms Dowling before the day in question amounted to a “pattern of violence”. Nor would I be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the glancing by Ms Dowling towards Ms Sumpner’s house on the occasion in question was done “with the intention of causing” Ms Sumpner “to fear physical or mental harm”.
	
	
	It may well be open to argue that such a glance was mischievous and uncalled for, but I would need far more evidence than there is in this court to be satisfied that it was done with the intention that I referred to. Accordingly, in due course I will allow the appeal in respect of the offence against s 13 of the Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act.
	
	
	Mr Baker, correctly in my opinion, argued that even if I allow the appeal regarding the s 13 offence, the s 14 contravention can still be made out. He is right there but I think one of the difficulties lies in the clause of the apprehended personal violence order that provides that Ms Dowling “must not enter or loiter about the premises” where Ms Sumpner was living. It is not clear what premises means in that context. I am certainly not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Ms Dowling entered the house, nor am I satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that she stepped onto the veranda. I cannot be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that she entered the premises. It is also acknowledged that the most that she did was to walk by the house and glance towards Ms Sumpner.
	
	
	I should add in deference to Mr Baker’s submissions that he argued that Ms Dowling’s credibility was damaged by two aspects of the evidence. One is something that she said to the police when they arrested her about not going onto the veranda. I think that there is an alternative explanation for that which emerged in re-examination.
	
	
	What is clear is that there had been some friction between the parties and as Ms Dowling said, she has been accused many times before. I do not think that there is a problem with her credibility so far as her dealings with Mr Castles were concerned. I think she was engaged in legally risky behaviour in approaching a witness for the prosecution in the days before the case and discussing his prospective evidence. The exchanges of texts which I have viewed do not cause me to seriously doubt her credibility.
	
	
	I should add also that a third aspect of challenge to her credibility was a claimed inconsistency about whether she was going to collect some keys at the time or some cats. She in fact acknowledged both in evidence. There did seem to be an inconsistency, but it is certainly not one that affects her credibility in my opinion.
	
	
	For those reasons I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Ms Dowling is guilty of the offence against s 14 of the Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act. 
	
	
	The formal order which I make is this. Under s20(1) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 I determine this appeal against conviction by setting aside the convictions.
	


HIS HONOUR:    Both of your clients Ms Dowling and the Director of Public Prosecutions were competently represented and I was assisted by your submissions gentlemen so thank you very much.

	The plaintiff moves pursuant to r 14.28(1) Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW) to strike out the defendants’ contextual imputations (1), (2) and (3). The grounds are:
	



	
	contextual imputations (1) and (2) do not differ in substance from each other;
	
	
	contextual imputations (1) and (2) do not differ in substance or kind to plaintiff’s imputations 3(f) and 5(f); and
	
	
	contextual imputation (3) is not different in substance or kind to plaintiff’s imputations 3(i) and 5(i);
	
	
	None of the contextual imputations are carried in addition to the totality of the plaintiff’s imputations.
	


The plaintiff’s imputations and the defendants’ contextual imputations


	
	The plaintiff’s imputations are as follows:
	


(c) The Plaintiff was reasonably suspected by the police as having murdered the Lin family.

(f) The Plaintiff was reasonably suspected by the police as having murdered Joo Won Choi.

(g) The Plaintiff was reasonably suspected by Police of having tortured Joo Won Choi.

(h) The Plaintiff became a fugitive from justice in suspicious circumstances.

(i) The Plaintiff was being investigated by Police for fraud.


	
	The defendants’ contextual imputations are as follows:
	


(1) The Plaintiff was a person of interest in the investigation of the murder of Joo Won Choi.

(2) The Plaintiff had so conducted himself as to warrant investigation by the police as a person of interest in the murder of Joo Won Choi.

(3) The Plaintiff had so conducted himself as to warrant investigation by the police as to whether he had committed fraud.


	
	The matters complained of (which are in identical terms) specifically describe the plaintiff as a “person of interest”, and the first two contextual imputations seek to encapsulate this meaning in relation to the Joo Won Choi murder. No justification defence under s 25 Defamation Act 2005 (NSW) is made in relation to the first four imputations; this defence is pleaded only to imputation (i).
	
	
	An alternate application by the plaintiff to plead back the defendants’ contextual imputations was abandoned during the hearing.
	


The relevant principles for form and capacity of contextual imputations


	
	In Tauaifaga v TCN Channel Nine Pty Ltd [2013] NSWSC 8 at [7], McCallum J summarised the relevant principles as follows:
	


“[7] It is sufficient for present purposes to repeat the succinct outline of propositions provided by Ms Chrysanthou, who appeared for the plaintiff in the present matter. Ms Chrysanthou submitted that the most useful authority is the decision of the defamation list judge, Nicholas J, in Ange v Fairfax Media Publications [2011] NSWSC 204, which may be distilled as follows:

(a) a contextual imputation must differ in substance from the plaintiff’s imputations (Ange at [25]);

(b) the question is, would the ordinary reasonable reader or viewer have understood the matter complained of to convey at the same time both the plaintiff’s imputations and the defendant’s contextual imputation (Ange at [16]);

(c) a contextual imputation will not be permitted if it is merely an alternative formulation to the plaintiff’s imputation. The requirement that the imputations differ in substance is a necessary but not sufficient requirement — there must be a difference in kind (Ange at [19]);

(d) if the defamatory sting of the contextual imputation is the same as the defamatory sting of the plaintiff’s imputation, even if the contextual imputation is broader it will still be impermissible (Ange at [27]);

(e) where there is more than one imputation relied upon by the plaintiff, it is necessary to consider all of the imputations separately and in combination to determine whether a contextual imputation is carried in addition to them (Ange at [28]).”

(See also Ange v Fairfax Media Publications [2011] NSWSC 204; Hyndes v Nationwide News Pty Limited [2011] NSWSC 633 at [28]-[31]; Kelly v Harbour Radio Pty Ltd [2013] NSWSC 9 at [2]-[3] and Liu v Fairfax Media Publications Pty Ltd [2013] NSWSC 7 at [17]-[22].)


	
	In MacDonald v Australian Broadcasting Corporation [2014] NSWSC 1472, McCallum J notes at [9]-[12] that it is not acceptable for a defendant’s contextual imputations are merely different ways of formulating the plaintiff’s imputations at a higher or lower level of generality or specificity, or merely reformulations of the plaintiff’s imputations drawn from precisely the same words.
	


The challenges to contextual imputations (1) and (2)


	
	As to the first and second contextual imputations, the plaintiff first submits that to be a “person of interest” in an investigation is no different to being described as having conducted oneself in such a way to warrant investigation as a person of interest. They are, Mr Rasmussen submits, the same imputation.
	
	
	However, the plaintiff’s imputations do not assert that the plaintiff is a “person of interest”; they assert that he is reasonably suspected by police of committing the crime in two separate murder cases. The matter complained of actually uses the words “person of interest” to describe the inquiries police have made about the plaintiff. As to the murder of Mrs Joo Won Choi, police identified “17 persons of interest”, according to paragraph 7, which goes on to state (in an unfortunate choice of wording) that these inquiries had not only failed to identify the person or persons, but were at a “dead end”. The plaintiff was a “person of interest” (paragraph 16) on a second occasion when he was “tracked down as part of the Lin family murder investigation because he tutored the Lin children”.
	
	
	What is the difference of being a “person of interest” and being “reasonably suspected by the police” as being the person who committed the murder? While the term “person of interest” has a legal meaning which might potentially be ambiguous (Singleton v Ffrench (1986) 5 NSWLR 425), the use of the term “persons of interest” in paragraph 7 and again in paragraph 16 of the matter complained of makes it clear that “persons of interest” is a general term for all persons being looked at by police, in circumstances where the plaintiff is one of those persons. That is very different to being “reasonably suspected by police” of having committed one of both of these murders.
	
	
	Mr Rasmussen also challenged these imputations, somewhat inconsistently, on the basis that the meaning of “person of interest” could never be as serious an imputation of being reasonably suspected of committing the crime. He submitted that imputations of being a “person of interest” were not capable of being conveyed.
	
	
	I accept Mr Rasmussen’s submissions that being a person of interest is an imputation of lesser seriousness to that of being reasonably suspected of actually having committed a crime. One of the issues for the jury at the trial will be whether the plaintiff’s imputations of reasonable suspicion, or the defendants’ contextual imputations of being a person of interest, more accurately distil the sting of the matter complained of.
	
	
	The objections raised by Mr Rasmussen go to the heart of the nature of the defence of contextual justification. What is a defendant to do when the plaintiff seeks to pitch an imputation too high, in circumstances where the matter complained of states a lesser imputation (the truth of which may be more readily established) in clear terms? Is the defendant shut out from seeking to rely upon the truth of the less serious imputation, simply because the plaintiff has pleaded an imputation that may be found by the jury to be conveyed, in circumstances where the truth of the lesser imputation may weigh heavily, or indeed completely, against other imputations arguably less serious than being a person of interest in a murder investigation, such as becoming a fugitive from justice in suspicious circumstances?
	
	
	In Hepburn v TCN Channel Nine Pty Ltd [1984] 1 NSWLR 386 at 397 Hunt J cites the example of a plaintiff pleading only an imputation that he has entered the country illegally, noting it is “a nice question for the jury to consider as to whether the effect of the truth of the imputation that the plaintiff is a liar is such as to say also that he entered the country illegally did not further injure his reputation”. Hunt J goes on to explain the entitlement of a defendant to plead imputations which are “different gradations of seriousness of the same basic assertion” and that the defendant’s entitlement to do so “rests upon the plaintiff’s entitlement to do so” (at 398). The plaintiff is “both entitled to and obliged to plead different gradations of seriousness to meet whichever gradation is accepted by the jury as the way in which the matter complained of would have been understood by the ordinary reasonable reader” (at 398), and the defendant must be placed in the same situation as the plaintiff so far as concerns the pleading of imputations” (at 399). While his Honour’s explanation relates to the pleading of contextual imputations under the repealed legislation (s 16 Defamation Act 1974 (NSW), these same entitlements apply to contextual imputations pleaded under the uniform legislation.
	
	
	The defendants should not be shut out from conducting the trial on the basis that the contextual imputations of being a person of interest represent an asserted lesser seriousness of the plaintiff’s imputations, particularly in circumstances where the imputations pleaded by the plaintiff include imputations such as investigation for fraud and being a fugitive from justice.
	
	
	Mr Rasmussen next challenged whether contextual imputations (1) and (2) differ in substance, pointing out that the particulars of justification are the same.
	
	
	Whether the plaintiff was a person of interest to police, as opposed to not being a person of interest but having so conducted himself that he should have been, is a clear distinction in meaning. The first can be satisfied by tendering evidence that the plaintiff was considered by police to be a person of interest. Proof of the second would be more onerous, in that it would require the defendants to establish that the plaintiff’s conduct warranted police investigation even though police had not considered the plaintiff’s conduct warranted his being regarded as a person of interest.
	
	
	I am satisfied not only that contextual imputations (1) and (2) not only differ from each other but also, for the reasons set out above, differ in substance from imputation (f) (“The plaintiff was reasonably suspected by the police as having murdered Joo Won Choi.”).
	


Contextual imputation (3)


	
	This brings me to a consideration of the same arguments in relation to contextual imputation (3). Similarly, I am satisfied that an imputation of having so conducted himself to warrant investigation for fraud differs in substance from an imputation of being investigated by police for fraud, in that the first may be satisfied merely by tender of the evidence of the investigation by police, whether that investigation was meritorious or not, whereas the contextual imputation requires the defendant to establish, with regard to the conduct of the plaintiff, that his activities were such as to warrant investigation by police as to whether he had committed fraud.
	


The adequacy of particulars


	
	Some of Mr Rasmussen’s objections were based on the inadequacies of the particulars of justification set out in the Defence, and these objections have considerable force.
	
	
	The defendants have set out two sets of particulars in the Defence. One relates to the defence of justification to imputation (i) (“The Plaintiff was being investigated by Police for fraud.”) and contextual imputation (3) (“The Plaintiff had so conducted himself as to warrant investigation by the police as to whether he had committed fraud.”). The other relates to the contextual imputations pleaded in relation to the Joo Won Choi murder. Mr Rasmussen complains that this style of particularisation of the justification of the imputations and contextual imputations in question not only shows these imputations do not differ in substance, but that the particularisation is inadequate.
	
	
	I agree, in relation to imputation (i) and contextual imputation (3), that the defendants should specify the basis upon which it is asserted that the plaintiff was being investigated by police for fraud. This will require setting out in more detail than it is currently the case the circumstances in which the police were investigating the plaintiff for fraud. For example, if police made inquiries in this regard as to the asserted borrowing of money from Peter Choi’s wife, and evidence is to be led at trial to this effect, it should be set out in the particulars. The sting of the imputation is that the plaintiff is being investigated by police for fraud, not whether that investigation was warranted.
	
	
	Additionally, the particulars go on to state that the plaintiff was convicted on 7 February 2014 of offences (committed in 2013) of obtaining a financial advantage by deception. Those offences occurred a considerable number of years after the murder of Joo Won Choi and are unrelated.
	
	
	While a defendant is entitled to rely upon conduct subsequent to publication of the matter complained of, I foresee difficulties at the trial unless the defendants are able to give greater specificity as to the investigation for fraud referred to in the matter complained of. I have granted leave to the defendants to provide further particulars in this regard.
	
	
	The particulars in relation to the plaintiff being a person of interest in the murder of Joo Won Choi would similarly benefit from particulars setting out the facts, matters and circumstances relied upon to identify the plaintiff as one of the 17 persons of interest, which would require setting out the facts and matters leading to the statement set out in paragraph 7 and 16. This will be necessary for contextual imputation (1). Contextual imputation (2) should set out the facts, matters and circumstances relied upon to establish that, whether the plaintiff was a person of interest or not, his conduct had warranted such an investigation by police.
	
	
	In Sims v Wran [1984] 1 NSWLR 317, Hunt J noted that particulars of justification should be set out with the precision of an indictment. In imputations as serious as those pleaded in these proceedings, that is essential. While the test for striking out a defence of justification is high (Fogarty v Nationwide News Pty Ltd [2013] WASC 477 at [14]), the current particulars fall well short of what should be provided. Additionally, if the defendants propose to rely upon the 2014 conviction of the plaintiff for fraud in relation to mitigation of damages, this conviction should be specifically referred to in the particulars, rather than the current general pleading.
	


Orders


	
	Grant leave to the defendants to file an Amended Defence by 17 June 2015 including additional particulars of justification and amending contextual imputations to read:

2703317,Rothe v Scott [2015] NSWDC 105,"Judgment


	
	The plaintiff by statement of claim filed 11 March 2015 seeks damages for a publication on Facebook of the following statements by the defendant, which are reproduced in the form in which they appeared:
	


“1. David Scott

2. March 12. Edited

3. Pedophile warning:- Nambucca has been used as a relocation for these monsters

4. – blue dolphin – nirvana hotel and above the indian restaurant! One of them even

5. tried to change his name and get a job at the local public school? People what the

6. fark share this post please! Can’t believe this just another council decision without

7. consent! Bus stops are right out the front of these hotels for our children?”


	
	The plaintiff pleads that the matter complained of gives raise to the following imputations:
	



	
	The plaintiff is a paedophile;
	
	
	The plaintiff so conducted his businesses at the Blue Dolphin Motel and the Nirvana Village Motel as to cause them to be a danger to children through the undisclosed presence of paedophiles; or alternatively,
	
	
	The plaintiff so conducted his businesses at the Blue Dolphin Motel and the Nirvana Village Motel as to permit them to be a danger to children through the undisclosed presence of paedophiles.
	



	
	The plaintiff brings an application to strike out the s 25 Defamation Act 2005 (NSW) defence of justification, which has been pleaded as follows:
	


“6A. In answer or alternative answer to the whole Statement of Claim the Defendant says the words of the matter complained of are true or substantially true.

Particulars of the truth

a. When people convicted of crimes are released from prison they are sometimes housed in Nambucca;

b. Some people released from prison were convicted of paedophillia and were provided temporary housing in Nambucca;

c. Some convicted paedophiles were temporarily housed in the blue dolphin, nirvana hotel and above the indian restaurant;

d. Paedophiles are monsters;

e. Children in Nambucca use bus stops to catch buses;

f. Bus stops are in front of or near to hotels in Nambucca.”


	
	There are a number of defects in this infelicitously drafted defence, including the failure to plead the defence to the imputations, the rolled up particulars of justification and their almost complete irrelevance to the imputations pleaded: Greenfield v Fairfax Media Publications Pty Ltd (No 2); Greenfield v Australian Broadcasting Corporation [2015] NSWSC 373. However, the basis upon which the application is brought is that the defendant has refused to answer request for further and better particulars of the facts and matters particularised.
	
	
	Mr Glaser, the solicitor for the defendant, has told the court he is “unable to answer” any of those particulars. He accepts that, in the absence of particulars as to the facts and matters referred to, which were essentially requests for dates and names, these particulars are so wholly deficient that they cannot stand.
	
	
	The circumstances in which a plea of justification will be struck out must be compelling. In Fogarty v Nationwide News Pty Ltd [2013] WASC 477, Kenneth Martin J states at [14]:
	


“[14] There was no dispute between the parties as to applicable principles of law underlying this strikeout application insofar as a challenge grounded on arguments that the pleaded defence does not disclose an arguable defence (ie, basis for the plea of justification or substantial truth) is to be evaluated. A relatively low interlocutory threshold arising out of principles well established in cases such as General Steel Industry Inc v Cmr of Railways (NSW) [1964] HCA 69; (1964) 112 CLR 125 applies. In other words, the plaintiff needs to make out an overwhelming case on this application that the particulars of truth as pleaded by the defendants are essentially untenable as regards a justification defence concerning this imputation.”

(See also Saraceni v Mentha [2013] WASC 95 at [50]; Heytsbury Holdings Pty Ltd v City of Subiaco (1998) 19 WAR 440 at 448–449 and Kingsfield Holdings Pty Ltd v Sullivan Commercial Pty Ltd [2013] WASC 347 at [40].)


	
	Applications to strike out an entire defence of justification are rare. Generally speaking, only in very clear cases will such a plea be struck out: MacDonald v Australian Broadcasting Corporation [2014] NSWSC 1472.
	
	
	That is not the case here. The combination of the hopelessness of the pleading and refusal to answer a single question in the plaintiff’s request for particulars warrants the making of such an order.
	
	
	The sole remaining defence is that of Offer of Amends (s 18 Defamation Act 2005 (NSW)). In those circumstances, this is an ideal matter for referral to mediation before an assistant registrar of the District Court, and steps have been taken for the mediation to take place on 16 June 2015.
	
	
	This court’s free mediation service is an essential part of defamation case management in the Sydney registry. As defamation is complex, and defamation insurance rare, litigants in defamation proceedings find the conduct of the case stressful as well as expensive. The opportunity for early resolution of proceedings, with the assistance and guidance of these registrars, aids not only the parties, but also the profession and the court. I take this opportunity to acknowledge the invaluable contribution the registrars make to the conduct of defamation proceedings in accordance with the precepts of ss 56 – 62 Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW).
	


Orders


	
	Strike out the defence of justification in paragraph 6A.
	
	
	Pursuant to s 26 Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW), direct the parties to attend for mediation before an assistant registrar of the District Court on Tuesday 16 June 2015.
	
	
	Matter stood over for further directions in the Defamation List on Thursday 18 June 2015 at 9:00am.

		27 July 2015",2015-06-03 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2703318,Howard v R [2015] NSWDC 317,"Judgment


	
	Damon John Howard - as he himself admits - has an appalling criminal history. He commenced offending when he was under eighteen and over the years until now (he is thirty-three), he has been to prison many times. Most of the offences are Local Court offences with some exceptions. He was charged with break and enter and stealing and was dealt with in the District Court.
	
	
	Damon Howard comes before me because of yet further offending. He has appealed from sentences imposed on him by Magistrate McCosker sitting at Taree Local Court. On 31 March this year his Honour sentenced Damon Howard to an effective sentence of eighteen months imprisonment and an effective non-parole period of fifteen months. It commenced on 20 January 2015 and the overall sentence is due to expire on 18 July 2016. The non-parole period commenced on the same day but is due to expire on 18 April 2016.
	
	
	The crimes that his Honour was sentencing Damon Howard for all involved theft or fraud. One of them was a drug offence. The theft offences were from businesses in Taree which included a discount chemist, Bing Lee and Officeworks. Three of the crimes he committed were larceny under s 117 of the Crimes Act 1900. He stole items from those three businesses. For each of those offences he was given a prison sentence. He was given nine months for the theft from Officeworks, twelve months for the theft from Bing Lee and again nine months for the theft from the discount chemist. His Honour directed that two of the sentences - those for the thefts from Officeworks and Bing Lee, which occurred about ten days apart - be served concurrently. One was longer than the other but the effect was that one of the sentences was subsumed by the other. However, for the theft from the discount chemist, which occurred a couple of months later, the Magistrate imposed a further sentence of nine months and directed that it commence at the expiry of the non-parole period for one of the earlier sentences. That produced the overall sentence, as I said, of eighteen months and the non-parole period of fifteen months.
	
	
	His Honour was also dealing with Mr Howard for offences of possessing cannabis, stealing Medicare and pension cards and offences to do with obtaining items from a chemist fraudulently. His Honour imposed fixed term sentences for those, all of which have now expired.
	


HIS HONOUR: I will just depart from my reasons, here, are you pursuing those appeals?

SCOTT: No, I wish to seek to withdraw those appeals.

HIS HONOUR: In due course I will grant leave to withdraw those appeals.


	
	When Damon Howard committed the theft from Officeworks and stole some computer equipment, he was accompanied by two others. One was his life partner Laura Pope. She pleaded guilty to shoplifting and was convicted and fined. Her criminal record is nowhere as serious as Mr Howard’s and in fact she did not commence committing crimes until she was aged thirty-one, whereas Mr Howard started his criminal activity as a teenager.
	
	
	There is a pre-sentence report about Mr Howard which was presented to his Honour. It assessed him as having a medium risk of re‑offending. It assessed him as not being eligible for a particular program dealing with drugs in custody because he is on the methadone program in custody. It described Mr Howard as “communicative and cooperative” and as appearing “to have gained some insight” into his criminal behaviour. The report noted that he “recognised the need to address his now entrenched substance dependence issues and its link to his criminal convictions, verbalising his want to address his issues in an appropriate manner.”
	
	
	Mr T Scott, who appears for Mr Howard in the appeal, called his client to give evidence. Through his client he tendered a letter written by his client acknowledging his offending behaviour and its link to his drug taking and indicating that he was wanting to turn his life around and be a role model for his two sons. That has not occurred to date. Mr Howard has got himself onto the methadone program in custody and is doing the Equip Program for addictions to drugs and alcohol. His methadone intake is being reduced, indicating that he is progressing in that treatment.
	
	
	What Mr Howard told Mr Scott - and Mr Scott bases his argument on this - is that he wants to enter a full time drug rehabilitation facility on his release. He has done counselling before through Probation and Parole, but he tells me has never done a live-in rehabilitation course. This coincides with his acknowledgment that he is now thirty-three and needs to make a serious decision about what direction his life is heading in. He is supported by his partner Ms Pope, who is in Court today.
	
	
	The effective non-parole period which his Honour imposed represented eighty-three per cent of the head sentence. The sentencing law envisages a usual non-parole period of seventy-five per cent. In special circumstances I can reduce a non-parole period to allow an offender more time on parole so that they can rehabilitate themselves.
	
	
	This is a case where the principles that a judge takes into account in sentencing someone point in different directions. On the one hand, a judge has to make sure that the sentence imposed on an offender provides adequate punishment for their crimes, deters the offender and others from committing similar offences and protects the community from the offender. The sentence has to denounce the conduct of the offender. On the other hand, the purposes of sentencing include promoting the offender’s rehabilitation.
	
	
	The community needs protecting from Damon Howard because of all of the offences he has committed in the past. To release him early puts the community at risk that he will go back to his offending behaviour. On the other hand, if I take into account his rehabilitation I could release him early and see how he goes in the full time rehabilitation that he wants to do. That is a risk because it may not work and he may go back to committing crimes within the community. But if it is successful, it means that he re‑enters the community after his course in a rehabilitated state and leads a law abiding life as a partner and as a father. He is a concreter by trade, so hopefully he would gain some employment as well. As I said, I can reduce the non-parole period for an offender if there are special circumstances.
	
	
	Mr A Baker appears for the respondent to the appeal, who is the Director of Public Prosecutions. He points out that evidence, although heartfelt, that an offender wants to change their ways is not really sufficient, particularly in an offender such as Mr Howard. But Mr Baker fairly acknowledges that allowing Mr Howard an opportunity to do an extended time in a live-in residential centre would amount to special circumstances for reducing the non‑parole period.
	
	
	I too am of that opinion independently. Despite the risk involved to the community I would be prepared to reduce the non-parole period Mr Howard is serving to nine months (that is a fifty per cent reduction), provided he left prison and went straight to a residential rehabilitation centre. The nine months does not expire until the middle of October.
	
	
	At this stage it is probably too early to have a commitment from any facility about a bed definitely being available. For that reason what I have in mind is to adjourn the case to a date in October and to find out at that stage whether there is definitely a bed available in a facility for Mr Howard. If there is then I would allow his appeal, reduce his non-parole period to nine months, direct his release on 19 October 2015 provided he goes straight from the prison to a residential rehabilitation centre and stays there for the duration of any program and accepts all reasonable recommendations and directions by staff at that centre. That, to my mind, would be a course which would hopefully reduce the risk of Mr Howard offending again but at the same time provide for him spending more time in full time custody from now until October to make him accountable for the crimes that he has committed.
	
	
	For those reasons I will not make any final orders today disposing of the appeals with the exception of the withdrawals and I will adjourn the case to a date in October.
	
	
	My formal orders will include these. In respect of counts 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 listed on exhibit A I note that all of those sentences have expired and I grant leave to the appellant to withdraw his appeal in respect of those sentences.

2703320,New South Wales Crime Commission v Chamoun [2015] NSWSC 682,"Judgment


	
	A restraining order was made in this matter in April 2012 in relation to the Defendant's involvement in the supply of drugs. An order was subsequently made that he be examined and on 24 May 2014, an order was made in relation to another person who might have knowledge about the nature and location of any property in which the Defendant had an interest.
	
	
	The Plaintiff now applies by motion that Nelson Douglas Hill be examined before a Registrar of the Court concerning the Defendant's affairs, including the nature and location of any property in which the Defendant has an interest. The application is made pursuant to Section 12(1)(b)(ii) of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 (NSW). The affidavit of Sandra Joy Davys sworn 14 May 2015 identifies a sufficient basis for the knowledge of the proposed respondent. Mr Quartermain, who appears for Defendant, does not oppose the order being made.
	
	
	I consider it is appropriate that the order for the examination of Mr Hill should be made. I therefore make Order 1 contained in the draft order provided to me, grant leave in accordance with paragraph 2 and grant liberty in relation to paragraph 3.

		03 June 2015",2015-06-01 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2703328,NSW Police Force v Gavrilov [2015] NSWLC 6,"JUDGMENT


	
	This is an application for an annulment of a conviction and sentence by the applicant, Stanislav Gavrilov, under s 4 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW) (""the Act"") (""s 4 application""). I heard the application on 15 May 2015 and stood the matter over to today, so that a sound recording of what occurred in the proceedings on 12 June 2014 might be obtained.
	


Chronology


	
	The evidence and the Court file disclose the following in relation to the history of the proceedings.
	
	
	On 26 April 2014 the applicant was charged with offences of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and use of a carriage service that a reasonable person would regard as menacing, harassing or offensive. The offences were alleged to have occurred on 4 and 6 March 2014, respectively, and were alleged to have occurred in a domestic context. The applicant was granted police bail to appear on 19 May 2014. The bail acknowledgement form signed by the applicant provided for that court date.
	
	
	On 19 May 2014 the applicant did not appear and was convicted in his absence under s 196 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW) and a warrant was issued under s 25(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) (""Sentencing Act"").
	
	
	On 12 June 2014 the warrant was executed and the applicant appeared unrepresented. The matter was adjourned for sentence on 26 June 2014. On that date the applicant did not appear, however, the Court file noted that a medical certificate had been received. The proceedings were adjourned to 23 July 2014 with a notation that the registry notify the applicant of the adjourned date.
	
	
	On 23 July 2014 the applicant failed to appear and a further warrant was issued under s 25(2) of the Sentencing Act. On 5 August 2014 the warrant was executed. The applicant appeared from custody, was represented by someone called Turner, whom the applicant said in evidence he understood was the duty solicitor. The applicant was granted bail and the Court file reveals that an application to annul the conviction entered on 19 May 2014 was filed and adjourned to 12 August 2014 so that the applicant might obtain a medical certificate.
	
	
	The grounds contained in that s 4 application were as follows: “That the order made by the [C]ourt was made in my absence. I was hindered from attending due to accident, illness, misadventure or other circumstance. It is in the interests of justice to annul the order having regard to the following circumstances”. Those grounds are part of the printed form that is available for such applications. There has been handwritten on the form the following: “Victim told me charge would be withdrawn (19/5/14). Medical certificate obtained not given to [C]ourt on time (23/7/2014).”
	
	
	On 12 August 2014 the applicant appeared, and according to the Court file, someone by the name of Tighe appeared for him. It is well known, and a fact I take judicial notice of under s 144 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) (""Evidence Act""), that a female solicitor called Ms Tighe from Legal Aid NSW frequently appeared at the Downing Centre and Central Local Court in 2014. Deputy Chief Magistrate Mottley has recorded on the Court papers “no s 4 app.”, adjourned the matter for sentence on 16 September 2014, and called for the preparation of a pre-sentence report.
	
	
	At the hearing of the s 4 application before me, a transcript of what occurred on 12 August 2014 was available although there was some controversy about its contents. At the top of the page it shows that Ms Tighe appeared for the applicant and that Sergeant Carlin appeared for the prosecution. The transcript is very short and on its face Ms Tighe played no role during the mention of the charges, and records the prosecutor telling her Honour that the applicant had instructed him to withdraw the s 4 application and requesting that her Honour order the preparation of a pre-sentence report. Everything attributed to the prosecutor in the transcript one would expect would have been said by a legal representative appearing for the applicant. Counsel for the applicant submitted that I ought not be satisfied that the applicant was in fact represented at the time the s 4 application was withdrawn. Counsel also submitted that enquiries had been made in relation to obtaining a sound recording of what occurred that day but had been unsuccessful.
	
	
	Over the morning adjournment I had made enquiries as to how long it would take to obtain the sound recording and was told it could be obtained in three days. I decided in those circumstances not to determine the application until the sound recording had been obtained. The sound recording has now been obtained. It is clear that a female person says the words attributed to the prosecutor in the transcript. The prosecutor is shown on the transcript as Sergeant Carlin, and it is a well-known fact in this location that the sergeant is one of the police prosecutors who regularly appears at the Downing Centre. The sergeant has appeared before me on numerous occasions over the last three years. The sergeant is a male person. I propose to take judicial notice of those facts under s 144 of the Evidence Act.
	
	
	Having now heard the sound recording of the proceedings that day and taking account of the notations on the Court file for that day, I have no doubt that the words attributed to the prosecutor in the transcript were in fact spoken by Ms Tighe, a solicitor appearing for the accused at that time.
	
	
	On 16 September 2014 the applicant appeared for sentence before then Deputy Chief Magistrate Culver. A transcript of what occurred that day is available and it is clear that Ms Tighe did represent the applicant that day. No attempt was made to re-agitate the abandoned s 4 application and no adjournment sought for the purpose of making a fresh application. The sentence proceedings proceeded and in relation to the assault occasioning actual bodily harm charge A received a sentence of imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 9 months with a balance of term of 3 months; i.e. a total sentence of 12 months with a non-parole period of 9 months. In relation to the use carriage service offence he was convicted and placed on a recognizance under s 20(1)(a) of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth).
	
	
	In support of the current application, counsel for the applicant relied upon the following statements by Ms Tighe on 16 September 2014 as showing that the applicant had always wished to defend the charge. Ms Tighe at p 1 L 48 of the transcript that day is recorded as saying in relation to an aspect of the pre-sentence report that was before the Court: 
	


“…and one thing to point out is that Mr Gavrilov originally had wanted to defend the charges, in particular the assault occasioning actual bodily harm. He missed his court date, was convicted in his absence, and then he decided to have the matter resolved and not to lodge a s 4 application in order to get the hearing date. That explains, in my submission, his attitude regarding – if I can take your Honour to p 2 – a significant change in his attitude to the offending in the final two paragraphs, 'The offender failed to take responsibility for his aggressive behaviour and he lacked insight to [sic] the impact on the victim, blaming her for his actions.' The explanation is he originally did not agree with the police facts which he is pleading to. It is not to go behind the plea now but that’s an explanation as to when he’s being honest and open with this author of the report, he’s not fully accepting the facts of the offence.”


	
	On the day of the sentence, the applicant lodged an appeal to the District Court, the notice of appeal stating, “I am appealing the above sentence because the sentence is too severe”. the applicant was granted bail to prosecute his appeal, hence a stay of his sentence operated: s 63 of the Act.
	
	
	I was told by the applicant’s counsel that the applicant withdrew his District Court appeal against his sentence on 20 February 2015.
	
	
	The current application for annulment of his conviction under s 4 of the Act was filed on 9 April 2015. In that application, the applicant stated that the conviction had been made in his absence. He also stated he was unaware of the original Local Court proceeding until after it was completed. He further stated he was hindered from attending due to illness and attached two medical certificates. The application also stated that it was in the interests of justice to grant the application and referred to the transcripts of 12 August and 16 September 2014.
	
	
	The medical certificates that were attached to the application reveal the following: There is a certificate dated 19 May 2014 which states in relation to the applicant: “He has attended for assessment of illness today”. Not only did the certificate not state that he was unfit to attend court, it failed to nominate any illness that the applicant was said to be suffering from. The medical certificate provided no evidence that the applicant was hindered from attending court because of illness.
	
	
	The second medical certificate is dated 26 June 2014 and records that the applicant “will be unable to attend court today 26/6/14 due to food poisoning”.
	


The Applicant’s Evidence


	
	The applicant gave evidence on the application. He said that he failed to attend Court on 19 May 2014 as he did not know about the date. He said that someone from the Court telephoned him that day, before lunch, and told him that he should obtain a medical certificate. He could not recall the name of the person who called him. He said that he did not fax the medical certificate to the Court as he did not know he should do so. In cross-examination he accepted that when charged he was probably given a court attendance notice which showed that he was required to attend Court on 19 May 2015. He said in cross-examination that he could not remember what illness he suffered from on 19 May 2015.
	
	
	His recollection was that on 12 June 2014 he reported on bail and was arrested under the warrant that had been issued for him. He said he believed he had the medical certificate for 19 May 2014 in his possession and that the police who arrested him took it.
	
	
	He said that he did not attend Court on 26 June 2014 as he was unwell and obtained a medical certificate which he faxed to the Court. It does appear from the Court file that the medical certificate was received by the Court that day.
	
	
	The applicant gave evidence that he was not told of the adjourned date after 26 June 2014, made no enquiries and relied upon the Court to advise him of the adjourned date. The applicant’s evidence was that he did not attend Court on 23 July 2014 as he did not know of that Court date. In cross-examination the applicant agreed that he made no enquiries of the Court as to the adjourned date after 26 June 2014.
	
	
	The applicant said he could not recall how he came before the Court on 5 August 2014 and believed he was represented by the duty solicitor. He accepted in cross-examination that a s 4 application was lodged on his behalf on 5 August 2014. His evidence was that it was the duty solicitor who prepared the original s 4 application and that none of the writing on it was his, and he did not sign it.
	
	
	In relation to what occurred in Court on 12 August 2014, when the Court was told that he withdrew his application under s 4 of the Act, the applicant’s evidence initially was that he could not remember if he was legally represented that day, and then said “I don’t think I was, No”. His evidence was that he did not know Ms Tighe from Legal Aid, and that her name “did not ring a bell”.
	
	
	When asked in his evidence in chief why he withdrew his initial s 4 application, the applicant said he could not remember why. He said it was possible that he had spoken to someone at Legal Aid about it. He said in cross-examination that he recalled being in Court when the s 4 application was withdrawn, but had no recollection of what was said by anyone on 12 August 2014.
	
	
	He agreed no attempt was made on 16 September 2014 to make a s 4 application but said he did not know he could.
	
	
	The applicant gave evidence that another charge involving the same complainant was dismissed after hearing on 28 November 2014.
	
	
	The applicant gave evidence that he had suffered from mental health issues in the past. In that regard two reports were tendered in support of the application. One by Dr Alex Pilsky, a consultant general and forensic psychiatrist, dated 19 June 2011 and one by Dr John Jacmon, a consultant psychologist, dated 18 January 2010.
	
	
	In 2010, Dr Jacmon assessed the applicant as suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, anxiety and substance abuse. Dr Jacmon proposed a treatment plan to address the conditions that he had assessed the applicant to be suffering from at that time. No evidence was given as to whether or not the applicant engaged in the proposed treatment plan and whether it had assisted the treatment of his conditions.
	
	
	In Dr Pilsky’s report of 19 June 2011, he diagnosed the applicant as suffering from chronic post-traumatic stress disorder, major depression, cannabis dependence and alcohol abuse. A treatment plan was contained within his report. No evidence was given as to whether the applicant engaged in the treatment plan and, if he did, whether or not it assisted the applicant in the treatment of those conditions.
	


The Law


	
	Section 4(3) of the Act provides that, “Except by leave of the Local Court, a person may not make more than one application under this section in relation to the same matter.” The provision does not expressly deal with the situation where an application is filed, withdrawn and another application is then filed and sought to be argued. During the hearing before me it was assumed that leave would be required in the current circumstances. Upon reflection, I think that assumption is incorrect. The use of the word “make” in s 4(3), in my opinion, leads to the conclusion that what is required is that an application be made and determined by the Court before leave is required for a further application to be heard. In my opinion, the simple filing of an application and the provision of a mention or hearing date does not result in an application having been made.
	
	
	All that occurred here was that an application was filed with the Court, but that application was never made to the Court in the sense that the Court was never called upon to hear and determine the application. In my opinion, no leave was required for the application that was heard before me in these circumstances.
	
	
	The unusual nature of the current application is highlighted by the terms of s 4(1A) of the Act. Section 4(1A) provides that an application by a defendant may only be made if:
	


“(a) in the case of an application for an annulment of a conviction – the defendant was not in appearance before the Local Court when the conviction was made or 

(b) in the case of an application for an annulment of a sentence – the defendant was not in appearance before the Local Court when the sentence was imposed.”


	
	Here the conviction was made on 19 May 2014 and the applicant was not present. In so far as the requirement for the exercise of the power to annul a conviction is concerned, it is present here. There is, therefore, power to annul the conviction. However, the applicant was sentenced on 16 September 2014 and was present when sentenced. There is no specific power in s 4 to annul a sentence unless a defendant was not in attendance at the time that the sentence was imposed.
	
	
	Section 10(1) of the Act provides that, “On being annulled, a conviction or sentence ceases to have effect and any enforcement action previously taken is to be reversed”. In my opinion, if a conviction is annulled under s 4, any sentence that was imposed as a consequence of that conviction is also annulled, even if the applicant was present at the time that sentence was imposed. Once a conviction ceases to have effect it must surely follow that any sentence that was imposed as a consequence of the conviction ceases to have effect.
	
	
	To hold otherwise would produce an absurd result in my opinion. It would be absurd, for example, to hold that there was, in this case, a power to annul the conviction, and exercise it, but conclude that the sentence remained in place because s 4 did not empower the Court to annul it as the applicant was present when it was imposed. How could a person be the subject of a sentence  of imprisonment without a conviction being in existence? Such an absurd result could not have been intended by the legislature in my opinion.
	
	
	While the phrase “any enforcement action previously taken is to be reversed” does not encompass a sentence, it does demonstrate a legislative intention that upon an annulment being granted, an accused should be in the same position he or she was in prior to the recording of a conviction or the imposition of a sentence. The construction I have given to the provision is consistent with that legislative intention.
	


Should the conviction here be annulled?


	
	Where a defendant applies to annul a conviction, s 8(2) of the Act provides:
	


“(2) The Local Court must grant an application for annulment made by the defendant if it is satisfied: 

(a) that the defendant was not aware of the original Local Court proceedings until after the proceedings were completed, or

(b) that the defendant was otherwise hindered by accident, illness, or misadventure or other cause from taking action in relation to the original Local Court proceedings, or

(c) that , having regard to the circumstances of the case, it is in the interests of justice to do so.”


	
	Here I am not satisfied that the applicant was not aware of the Local Court proceedings until after they were completed. In relation to the recording of the conviction, the completion date is 19 May 2014, being the date the conviction was recorded. The applicant conceded in cross-examination that he was probably given a court attendance notice showing the Court date. I referred earlier to there also being a bail acknowledgment form signed by the applicant showing that date. In these circumstances I am in fact satisfied that the applicant knew of the Court date.
	
	
	I am also not satisfied that the applicant was hindered by accident, illness, misadventure or other cause from taking action in relation to the original Local Court proceedings. I accept that in considering whether the applicant has satisfied that requirement of the provision, a liberal approach should be adopted; see Miller v DPP (2004) 145 A Crim R 95; Rukavina v DPP [2008] NSWDC 214; Boulghourgian v Ryde City Council (2008) 8 DCLR (NSW) 314 and Willis v R [2014] NSWDC 325.
	
	
	 In relation to 19 May 2014, the medical certificate for that date that has been supplied specified no illness that the applicant was said to have been suffering that prevented him from attending Court that day. The certificate, somewhat unusually, simply stated that he had attended for “assessment of illness today” and provided no indication of what illness the applicant was said to be suffering from, or why it prevented him from attending Court that day. In cross-examination, the applicant said he could not remember what illness he had been suffering from that day. There is no basis on the evidence for any finding that the applicant was too ill, or had an accident or some other misadventure that caused him not to be at Court on 19 May 2014 when the conviction was recorded.
	
	
	I am also not satisfied that having regard to the circumstances of this case, it is in the interests of justice to grant the annulment of the conviction on 19 May 2014. At the  time that the applicant withdrew his initial s 4 application he was represented by a solicitor engaged by Legal Aid NSW. The matter was adjourned for sentence on 16 September 2014 and the same solicitor appeared for the applicant. No application was made to re-agitate a s 4 application on 16 September 2014. It is a clear inference from the transcript on both days that the solicitor, in not pursuing a s 4 application, was doing so in accordance with her instructions, and advised the Court that the applicant had decided not to proceed with his s 4 application. The applicant gave no evidence to suggest that the solicitor did not act in accordance with his instructions, and the solicitor was not called. I find that the solicitor, in acting in the manner in which she did, was acting in accordance with the applicant’s instructions.
	
	
	It is now more than a year since the allegations were made and the convictions were recorded. The applicant has served a significant part of the sentence that was imposed on him.
	
	
	Both at the time of the withdrawal of the initial s 4 application and the sentence, the applicant was legally represented. It appears that he now seeks to have the conviction annulled and to defend the matter as he has very belatedly reconsidered his decision to abandon his original s 4 application.
	
	
	The phrase “interests of justice” should be construed widely, and is not only concerned with the interest of an accused. There are the interests of the complainant and the prosecution to consider, as well as the interest of the community generally in having allegations of domestic violence heard at the earliest opportunity. Delays in the hearing of cases can impact adversely on all interested parties to the proceedings.
	
	
	While I accept that the provision is to be applied in a non-restrictive way, in my view it cannot be said in these circumstances that it is in the interests of justice to grant the annulment.
	
	
	In circumstances where an accused was legally represented at the time a s 4 application was withdrawn and at sentence, and where I am satisfied that in withdrawing the original s 4 application and not re-agitating it prior to sentence the solicitor was acting in accordance with instructions, in my opinion it would bring the justice system into disrepute to hold that the interests of justice required the application to be granted.
	
	
	I note that it has been held that the ground in s 8(2)(c) of the Act should be given an interpretation which limits its scope to the circumstances which caused  the applicant’s non-appearance: Police v Edwards [2008] NSWLC 28. I was not addressed in relation to the construction adopted in that decision and find it unnecessary to express a view as to its correctness.
	
	
	For these reasons the application is refused.

		20 July 2015",2015-05-28 00:00:00,NSW Local Court
2703329,R v FRANKIEWICZ [2015] NSWDC 309,"SENTENCE


	
	HIS HONOUR: Dominik Lukas Frankiewicz appears today for sentence in relation to five offences committed by him between 14 July 2014 and 18 August 2014.
	
	
	One of the offences to which he has pleaded guilty and for which he was committed for sentence is an offence contrary to s 112(2) Crimes Act 1900 which carries a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment and has a standard non-parole period of five years imprisonment. That is the “principal offence”. But there are no matters on a Form 1, so in describing it as the “principal offence” I am referring to it as obviously the most serious offence with which I am concerned.
	
	
	Related to that offence are four offences of contravening apprehended violence orders committed at various times between 14 July and 18 August 2014. Those offences, as the facts will reveal, are intimately connected with the underlying reasons for the offending and other related matters. One contravene apprehended violence order offence, that is the one committed on 14 July, is an offence which was committed at the time of the commission of what I have described as the principal offence. The other three offences, however, were committed at later date or dates, two of them committed on the one day and the third, that is the fourth contravene apprehended violence order committed on 18 August leading to the arrest of the prisoner.
	
	
	The reason I am dealing with these matters which are ordinarily summary matters and are of course still summary matters but amenable to his jurisdiction is because they were referred to this Court as related offences on a s 166 Criminal Procedure Act certificate and are to be dealt with in accordance with s 167 of that Act.
	
	
	I will return to the technical issues that arise concerning those matters shortly but those four charges dealt with summarily carry a maximum penalty each of two years imprisonment and 50 penalty units, and of course, I am required under s 167 to fix an appropriate sentence for those matters, the prisoner having admitted his guilt in relation to those matters before me.
	
	
	The prisoner pleaded guilty to the indictable matter, that is, the principal offence to which I have referred at the Local Court and was committed for sentence. It was agreed by the Crown, as was submitted by counsel for the prisoner, that the prisoner was entitled to a discount of 25% upon the otherwise appropriate sentence to recognise the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty in accordance with the guideline judgment in relation to such matters of Thomson v R; Houlton v R. Likewise, I propose to give the prisoner the benefit of a discount of 25% upon the otherwise appropriate sentence for the matters on the s 166 certificate, they were placed on the s 166 certificate being summary matters, as I would understand it, in anticipation of pleas of guilty being entered and in my view thus the prisoner is entitled to recognition of the same discount given the way in which the matters have come to Court.
	
	
	As I earlier mentioned the prisoner was arrested on 18 August 2014 when the last of the offences in time was committed and has been in custody since that date. The sentence will commence from the date he came into custody.
	
	
	In sentencing the prisoner in relation to the indictable matter and the four summary matters I am required to give effect to principles of totality of sentencing in accordance with decisions such as the High Court judgment in Pearce v R (1998) 194 CLR 610, particularly at [45] and subsequent decisions of the Court of Criminal Appeal such as the decision earlier this century of Hammoud in 2000.
	
	
	Each of the offences was committed whilst the prisoner was subject to a community service order in respect of offences committed against the same victim and were in breach of s 9 bonds granted in relation to offences directed at or concerned with the same victim. Committing offences whilst subject to conditional liberty is an aggravating factor and here the matter is a significant issue because of the fact that the offending on prior occasions bear similar characteristics, albeit not identical characteristics, of much of the offending on the prior occasion. Of course the offending with which I am concerned is related to the same victim, and much was said in the course of the evidence and in the submissions about what lessons the prisoner ought to have learnt from his experience of appearing at the Local Court in June 2014 from custody, after being apparently in custody for six or seven days, to be sentenced in relation to those earlier offences.
	
	
	I will come back to that matter shortly.
	
	
	The facts of the matter are set out in a set of “agreed facts” although I note the facts are not signed by the prisoner.
	
	
	I will deal with the prisoner’s evidence before me given yesterday afternoon, of which I do not have a transcript of course, at a later time. Essentially the prisoner accepted the facts that are set out.
	
	
	The prisoner had been in a relationship with the person I will describe quite properly as the ‘victim’ for apparently 18 months up until they separated in about March 2014. The victim was, as I understand it, 18 years old at that time but obviously was somewhat younger when she commenced the relationship with the prisoner. He was born on 28 September 1989 and at the time of the offending with which I am concerned would have been 24 years of age. He is now 25 years of age. Not that it matters a great deal but I might have thought the prisoner in his presentation in both size and appearance appeared slightly younger.
	
	
	Police had applied for and had been granted a provisional apprehended violence order in May 2014. This arose out of offences, as I understand it, committed by the prisoner towards the victim from mid‑May 2014. It is important that all relevant matters be placed in their proper chronological order.
	
	
	On 16 May 2014 the prisoner assaulted the victim occasioning actual bodily harm to her and damaged or destroyed her property giving rise to those two charges for which he was subsequently dealt with on 18 June 2014.
	
	
	He also had previously, on 9 May 2014 according to the records available to me, committed the offence of intimidation. He subsequently on 29 May 2014 contravened the provisional apprehended domestic violence order that had been granted in mid‑May as a result of the prisoner, I assume, assaulting the victim. He also further committed an offence of contravening an apprehended domestic violence order on 12 June 2014. This course of conduct, apart from being absolutely unacceptable, led inevitably to him being retained in custody because clearly at that point there could be no guarantee that the victim could be protected from the prisoner given his manner of behaviour.
	
	
	I have read the facts as they were drafted in relation to that series of offences, as I understand it, committed between 9 May 2014 and 12 June 2014. I am not sentencing the prisoner in relation to those matters but I must point out given the number of offences, the time over which they were committed and the circumstances in which they were committed with the prisoner being restrained from contacting or being near the home of the victim, I am surprised that the prisoner was treated as leniently as he was in the Local Court.
	
	
	Be that as it may, the prisoner when arrested apparently on 12 June 2014 remained in custody until he appeared at the Central Local Court on 18 June 2014. For the last contravene apprehended domestic violence order that he committed, that is the offence committed on 12 June 2014, he was ordered to perform 100 hours community service.
	
	
	In respect of the other offences, the assault occasioning actual bodily harm which I regard as a very serious offence of its type and particularly vicious, as well as the other offences I have identified variously committed between 9 May and 29 May 2014, the prisoner was granted s 9 bonds pursuant to the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 for a period of 12 months. It appeared from what I heard of the evidence that the prisoner did not receive any supervision. The prisoner gave evidence of performing his community service, the phrase was used “picking up papers,” but spoke not, nor was aware of, any supervision, counselling or direction given to him from the time he appeared at the Local Court on 18 June 2014 until he was arrested approximately two months later. Whether there was sufficient time for any counselling, direction and the like to be given to the prisoner is debatable but if it is true that all he did was perform some perfunctory community service without receiving what was clearly urgent attention to his obsession with the victim is a matter of considerable regret, particularly for the victim.
	
	
	The final orders were granted in relation to the provisional apprehended domestic violence order taken out on 9 May, I assume when the matter was dealt with in mid‑June at the Court. Certainly it is clear that the prisoner knew that he was restrained in his contact with the victim. One of the complications, expressly stated in the facts, and a complication I am afraid that may live with the victim at least for some period of time, is that at the time of the ending of the relationship she was pregnant to the prisoner. What this means in due course is a matter for other jurisdictions to settle. However, part of the problem in this case, and it is not a problem of the victim it is a problem of the prisoner’s, is that because the prisoner understood (I point out he was somewhat prevaricating about this aspect) that the victim was pregnant he felt that he had some proprietorial right over her or any decision she made about the child she was carrying. He could not have been more wrong.
	
	
	I will deal with his evidence before me after I have summarised the agreed facts. But the prisoner kept on telling me that amongst the explanations he had for his totally unacceptable behaviour of harassing and making the life of the victim unbearable was his claim of “being in love” as if that was not only an explanation but an excuse for his conduct, nothing I hasten to say could be more wrong.
	
	
	The two offences, the principal offence and one of the breach ADVO conditions and restriction offences committed on 14 July arose when the prisoner turned up at the victim’s home, the victim luckily having her brother at home with her, and the prisoner was seen to kick the glass doors of the victim’s family home open making a hole large enough for him to fit through.
	
	
	The victim at the time the prisoner was kicking in or damaging the glass doors was in the bathroom. She called triple-0 and the victim’s brother sought to intercept the prisoner when he stepped through the hole carrying a brick in his right hand and started walking towards the victim who had emerged apparently from the bathroom.
	
	
	The victim’s brother whose age is not disclosed to me tried to restrain the prisoner. The prisoner said to the victim. “This is your fault, I want another chance”. The prisoner at this stage had the brick in his hand. He gave an account of this offence which if not false was certainly wrong, claiming that he created the hole simply by throwing the brick through the window or the glass door which is not in accordance with the agreed facts.
	
	
	To be fair, this offence stopped when the prisoner turned around and left the house putting the brick down, stepping back through the broken glass. But he continued to remain around the house. At one stage while in the victim’s house he went into the victim’s bedroom, grabbed her laptop and apparently tore it into two pieces. The laptop was worth or had cost $1,562 to replace. Hence, the charge that I am specifically concerned with, rather unusually it might be said, involves a breaking and entering in circumstances of aggravation to wit the prisoner knew that people were present within the said dwelling house, the serious indictable offence being “malicious damage” as it is described in the charge.
	
	
	By being at the house, of course, he was in breach of the apprehended domestic violence orders then permanently in place at least for two years, which restrained him from contacting the victim and approaching her or going to her home.
	
	
	He committed two offences of contravening apprehended domestic violence orders as I said earlier on 15 August, one at 1am in the morning. The victim’s mother heard the dog barking and found the prisoner, very disturbingly I must say, hiding in the cupboard of the daughter’s bedroom. The second offence committed the same day at 3pm involved the victim’s mother coming home and smelling the aftershave of the prisoner, going to the victim’s bedroom cupboard and finding the prisoner hiding inside the cupboard again. The mother left the bedroom and dialled triple‑0. The prisoner asked her not to contact the police. While she was on the phone the prisoner left the house. He did not threaten her.
	
	
	The last offence in time involved police being called to the home of the victim and seeing the prisoner exiting the victim’s bedroom and run toward the front door. He jumped out a front window and was ultimately picked up some distance away and has remained in custody ever since.
	
	
	This brings me to something that arose from the prisoner’s evidence which is not addressed in the agreed facts and about which I cannot make a decision one way or the other. That is the suggestion that lies in the facts themselves, although implicitly, and in the evidence directly of the prisoner, that from time to time notwithstanding the existence of the apprehended domestic violence orders the prisoner was invited to the home by the victim herself. I cannot conclude one way or the other of whether that was so, but even if the victim had invited the prisoner to her home the prisoner had no right to be there. Certainly in the absence of other evidence I could not conclude in any way that the invitation that the prisoner spoke about was in fact one given voluntarily by the victim.
	
	
	The prisoner’s criminal history I have referred to in order to bring the current matters into context. His counsel who ably represented his interests drew the Court’s attention to the fact that his other criminal history, if I may call it that, is not significant. That is fairly to be said. He has some appearances in the Children’s Court in 2007. He does have a prior finding of guilt in 2008 for assaulting a police officer and resisting an officer in execution of his duty or her duty and behaving in an offensive manner, all offences apparently committed on New Year’s Day 2008 for which he was modestly fined in each case.
	
	
	He also has a finding of guilt for possessing a prohibited drug, he having some background in the abuse of illegal substances as well as alcohol, and a conviction for having a knife in his custody in January 2013 for which he was fined $300. Of course those findings of guilt do him no credit but they are modest matters. The most significant findings of guilt and convictions must of course be those involving the same victim and which gave rise to the various restraints upon him that mean that he had no right to be at the victim’s home at any time.
	
	
	The prisoner, as I said, gave evidence to the Court. He gave evidence about the history that he gave the psychologist whose report I have read, his use of medication in the past, matters relating to the commission of the offences, some of which I have already noted, and steps he had taken whilst in custody to address some of the underlying issues that apparently have contributed to some of his behaviour.
	
	
	I am not sure that the particular matters identified by him really provide much insight into the clear obsession he had with the victim and the totally unreasonable way he went about trying to re-establish a relationship with the victim. One might have thought, as I pointed out to him in his evidence, that punching his former partner in the face who he would have understood was pregnant to him did not reflect the actions of a person who was truly in love with another.
	
	
	I point out from the outset as was self-evident by the presentation of the prisoner that he was not an altogether impressive witness. It must be fairly said that he was quite inarticulate. He spoke on many occasions in generalities and in a formulaic fashion. I accept of course that he is certainly not an experienced witness. He may have never given evidence before.
	
	
	I accept that he expresses regret for his conduct and on several occasions tried to explain his conduct, as I said earlier, as arising from the fact that he was “in love” and he was “not thinking straight”. But he did not convince me that he had a complete understanding of the seriousness of his conduct in the context of his previous offending or a real insight into what caused him to act the way he did. As outspoken, and properly so, commentators on the issue of domestic violence point out time and time again such as Ms Rosie Batty the Australian of the Year, obsession leading to violence and intimidation and creating fear in the hearts and minds of the victims of domestic violence is not consolation for those victims at all. In the circumstances of this matter it is quite irrational, bearing in mind of course the offences with which I am concerned arose quite a number of months after the breakup of the relationship and after, as I have pointed out, the prisoner had been dealt with in another Court and given some leniency which ought to have restrained him from further crime.
	
	
	The prisoner also reflected some degree of immaturity to be fair. He had very little insight as to the consequences of his previous appearance at Court, the granting of good behaviour bonds, and even the time that he had in custody before those bonds were granted to him to reflect upon his conduct. He told me that his conduct was inappropriate, which is an understatement, but he also told me that in custody he had undertaken some courses in relation to anger management and substance abuse, and being now alcohol and drug free this had given him an opportunity to “reflect.” He pointed out that it took him some months actually to properly reflect upon what he did and this may reflect some disturbance in his thinking, if not arising from any psychological or psychiatric condition, arising out of his feelings towards the victim.
	
	
	The Crown in a skilled cross-examination particularly pressed him as to why some of the matters that were raised with him by the Crown and by myself concerning his prior behaviour and the need to reflect upon it had not sunk in after he had been dealt with in the Local Court and had been in custody. The best explanation he could give in his evidence as I understand it was that he was “caught up in the moment” around this time, that in fact he had not adequate time to reflect even whilst in custody for seven days and also that he continued to drink alcohol, particularly after being released. He told me in fact that the offences of 14 July were committed after he travelled down from Newcastle, where he normally lived, by train and consumed a bottle of spirits. Again, the consumption of alcohol is not a mitigating factor and many examples of domestic violence such as this is arise when the perpetrators have drunk alcohol, inflaming the situation rather than improving the situation.
	
	
	He told me he was content to undertake counselling and obey directions about his future conduct from the parole authorities. It seems to me that unless he follows directions from them the consequences will be catastrophic for him and possibly others.
	
	
	He was unable really to explain the character of his conduct and could not in any way justify it given some of the circumstances I have pointed out.
	
	
	I accept from his evidence that he is at this stage desirous of pursuing a path to reformation and complying with directions that may be required of him by the Parole Authority. But of course at this time he has a number of months of sobriety and I am concerned, as all Judges are, that when one is dealing with an offender who has committed offences over a period of time and repeatedly against the one victim the restraints upon him of parole supervision once freed from custody arrangements may not be sufficient to protect him from further offending or to protect the community.
	
	
	It is in this context that I consider the psychologist’s report. The prisoner had given evidence of being hospitalised at a mental health unit as it is described in the psychologist’s report at the “Mater Hospital”. I do not know whether that hospital is Newcastle or the “Mater” with which I am familiar on the Pacific Highway near North Sydney.
	
	
	What the prisoner said in his evidence was that he had been “diagnosed with schizophrenia.” It is accepted by his counsel and certainly it must be objectively observed that there is no reliable evidence that the prisoner had schizophrenia or has schizophrenia at this time. In fact the psychologist’s report suggests that whatever condition he was treated with at the mental health unit, where he was an inpatient for approximately a month or six weeks, was not a chronic condition.
	
	
	I point out initially the prisoner asserted that he was hospitalised in early 2014 which would have been at the time of the breakup. However, he told me that he had his 24th birthday whilst at the unit and his birthday is in September, so this hospitalisation would appear to have occurred some months before the breakup and certainly quite a number of months before the offences with which I am now concerned.
	
	
	I am not a medical practitioner, obviously, nor a psychologist but from the history obtained by the psychologist and the statements of the prisoner it seems to me the condition for which he was treated, no discharge summary has been provided to the Court, would appear to be some form of ‘drug induced psychosis’, an expression in fact used by the prisoner himself to describe at one stage the circumstances of his admission and treatment.
	
	
	What is interesting from the prisoner’s evidence and from the psychologist’s report is that the prisoner was prescribed risperidone which is an antipsychotic medication because he was “accusing people of doing things and being angry and to stop bad thoughts.” However, he told me that when he was discharged from hospital he stopped using that medication notwithstanding advice to the contrary. He had not had the recurrence to the symptomology, nor any adverse effect of ceasing that medication. That would seem to suggest, purely of course from a lay perspective, that in fact the condition for which he was hospitalised was an acute condition not a chronic condition.
	
	
	It must be said that the offences with which I am concerned were committed when he was not using antipsychotic medication but also where there is nothing in the objective facts or the account given by the prisoner to suggest any psychotic condition being causally connected to the offending, even if the offending represents conduct of a highly unstable person.
	
	
	His counsel conceded that no issue arose pursuant to the 2004 decision of Hemsley, where Justice Sperling summarised relevant principles relating to the sentencing of offenders with mental illness and mental abnormalities which was in a more detailed fashion discussed by the then learned Chief Judge at Common Law, Justice McClellan, in the 2010 of De La Rosa ([2010] NSWCCA 194, particularly at [177] - [178]). Thus, I was not invited to consider a causal connection between any mental illness or abnormality or imbalance such as to warrant less weight being given to general deterrence to consider the hardships arising in custody from the condition, to consider whether the prisoner was a danger to the community and thus greater weight need be given to personal deterrence or the other matters described by Justice McClellan.
	
	
	However, of course, this background of mental instability requiring hospitalisation and essentially relying upon the history recorded by the psychologist and some evidence of the prisoner is a relevant matter to take into account. It more likely than not reflects the adverse effect upon the prisoner of the abuse of alcohol and drugs which would be a contributing factor it would appear to some of the offending behaviour, particularly the principal offence given the history of consumption of alcohol.
	
	
	I note from the psychologist’s report that when he examined the prisoner on 8 April 2015 there was no evidence of significant psychopathology in his account to the psychologist. There was no evidence of psychosis, psychotic thought processes, unusual verbalisations, delusions, formal thought disorder or antisocial personality disorder. He presented an even mood and the psychologist thought he was of average intelligence.
	
	
	He has had a very unusual history and I am prepared to accept that his personal history is so as the psychologist in a somewhat disjointed fashion reflected. He is one of three children but has had no real contact with his father for quite a long time and his mother had lived in a number of domestic relationships that were entirely unsatisfactory to the prisoner himself. He had witnessed it would appear a great deal of domestic violence. He has lived with his grandmother since he was about 13 and he has an aunt who also helped look after him. One of his aunts, maybe the same aunt, it is unclear from the evidence and the information I have, has travelled some distance to support him in Court, as his grandmother.
	
	
	He told the psychologist that when he lived with his mother he saw a lot of “bad things” which have had a big impact on him. He could not remember, however, at school any diagnosis of dyslexia or ADHD or ADD, notwithstanding poor performance at school, although he did enjoy some subjects.
	
	
	Since leaving school after finishing Year 10 he has had casual and irregular employment largely in the hospitality industry and with labouring, but he was about to start some form of warehouse management course at TAFE before he came into custody.
	
	
	The psychological assessments that were undertaken reveal that by reference to the Beck Depression Inventory he scored in the moderate range for mood disorder, he had a mild range of anxiety, he had marked risk on personality assessment of acting out. That is, acting impulsively as he did on occasions here. Although I point out whilst I could not conclude the offences were planned offences the prisoner on occasions he travelled considerable distances in the knowledge that he was restrained from approaching the victim to commit various offences with which I am concerned.
	
	
	He had a tendency to have detachment from others and alcohol problems and he was at moderate risk of future problems with anxiety, depression and personal distress. He was it is said, to put it as an understatement, at “mild risk” in the areas of anger control and hostility control. I think the facts of this matter reflect very high levels of inability to control his anger. The psychologist concluded that drug and alcohol use would disinhibit him which is self-evident and that the prisoner had a number of interpersonal deficiencies which is self‑evident. In the anger management area he was depicted on the relevant testing as being “somewhat impatient and easily irritated” which again is an understatement.
	
	
	By reference to what was called the Personality Assessment Inventory the diagnostic possibilities that were hypothesised were alcohol dependence and substance dependence but there was no any substantial mental illness or abnormality causally connected to the offending.
	
	
	His grandmother was spoken to by the psychologist and gave a history of his mental health problems and his difficulties arising after treatment for that. The prisoner’s dysfunctional childhood was reflected upon as well as his chaotic upbringing. The psychologist formed the view, given the prisoner had undertaken courses in custody concerning anger management and drug and alcohol counselling, which the prisoner had found useful as he said in his evidence, that the prisoner’s prognosis was good if he remained drug free and if he continued vocational training and “disassociates from past negative influences.”
	
	
	It must be pointed out of course by reference to that opinion that no negative influence caused him to commit the particular crimes with which I am concerned. He expressed regret to the psychologist and described his actions to the psychologist as “a very stupid brain explosion” and he wanted to “apologise for this disturbing behaviour.” Again, I point out these “brain explosions” were repetitive and continued over an extended period of time and were not impulsive matters.
	
	
	Of course all these sentiments may be genuinely expressed, but the conduct has to be seen not as one single brain explosion but a number of actions as I have categorised them. The psychologist said the prisoner would benefit from relapse prevention programs and would need appropriate medical psychological monitoring, although the prisoner did not have a full understanding of what mental health issues were, according to the psychologist.
	
	
	Out of the evidence of the prisoner and the psychologist, and of course the material relating to the offending, the Crown by agreement addressed first in a most helpful manner. He conceded the need for a finding of special circumstances to give the prisoner an extended period of supervision to address the issues identified by the psychologist. This submission as supported by the defence and I am in agreement with the submission that the two parties have put. In my view pursuant to s 44 I should make a finding of special circumstances to give the prisoner who is now serving his first term of imprisonment in reality an extended period of supervision, firstly to assist him to adjust to community living and to get appropriate direction in relation to personal relationships, alcohol and drug usage, employment and training, and also counselling or treatment in relation to any residual mental health problems.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that a discount of 25% upon the otherwise appropriate sentence for the early pleas was appropriate and I have already dealt with that.
	
	
	The Crown made specific submissions about what was said to be “aggravating factors” arising under s 21A(2). In relation to a number of these submissions of course I bear in mind that whilst they were put in a general fashion I understood the Crown to be saying that some of the matters adverted to obviously were specifically relevant to the principal offence, although some of the features of aggravation are common to all five offences. However, they are of greater salience in the sentencing exercise obviously in relation to the indictable offence and the consideration of course of the standard non-parole period.
	
	
	The Crown said, firstly, that the prisoner was in relation to the indictable offence “threatening violence” by carrying the brick in the manner he did as set out in the agreed facts. This is an aggravation under s 21A(2)(b) of the Act and this was not disputed by the accused’s counsel.
	
	
	Secondly, it was submitted that an aggravation was that the offence was committed in the home of the victim. This is an aggravation pursuant to subpara (eb). The Crown took me to the decision of Andrew Smith [2013] NSWCCA 209, particularly in the judgment of the Court at [44] - [47]. As the Court noted from previous decisions of the Court of Criminal Appeal, particularly the judgment of Palijan from 2010, the fact that an element of the offence was breaking and entering does not require that the premises be the home of the victim and thus the commission of an offence such as malicious damage of property in this case or intimidation as it was in the case of Palijan involved the aggravation of being committed in the home of the victim. This was conceded by counsel for the prisoner.
	
	
	The third significant matter of aggravation arising under s 21A(2) was the fact that the offences with which I am concerned were all committed when the prisoner was subject to conditional liberty. He was subject to conditional liberty not only by reason of the fact that he was required to perform community service and he was subject to good behaviour bonds, but of course the four offences on the s 166 Certificate particularly involved breaches of restrictions under apprehended domestic violence orders reflecting upon the fact that in respect of the principal offence with which I am concerned on this aspect the prisoner committed that offence when he was subject to the ADVO. Of course I appreciate the need not to double-dip. It is an element of the four offences on the certificate that he breached the ADVOs. Clearly the element of breach of conditional liberty in this limited respect, not in the wider respect which applies to all five offences, does not apply to those offences. But that aspect of conditional liberty certainly has relevance to the principal offence. To put it in another way, the breach of conditional liberty in the circumstances of this case with that conditional liberty relating to offences or orders made in respect of the victim is a significant matter, particularly in relation to the sentencing for the principal offence.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the offence fell within the middle range of offending. I discussed this with the learned Crown Prosecutor and with counsel for the accused, I do not propose to go through the detail of those discussions but in my view in respect of the offending in relation to the principal offence, and that is the offence most concerned with this categorisation, given the terms of s 54A(2) and s 54B(2) of the Act, the categorisation of the offending in the middle range of offending in my view is not an accurate assessment of it. I appreciate the offending is objectively serious in the proper context that I have outlined, but one is required also to consider other factors. Firstly, the circumstance of aggravation arises out of knowing the victim was present in circumstances where the prisoner was directing the actions towards the victim. This is a substantial matter to take into account but on the other hand the serious indictable offence committed was that of malicious, as it is described, damage or reckless damage to property which has to be considered within the range of offences contemplated by s 112 Crimes Act as being of a less serious category. In that regard I note the discussion about these matters in decisions of the Court of Criminal Appeal such as Harris and Huynh from 2007 and 2005, particularly Justice Simpson’s observations in Huynh. I appreciate of course her Honour was not laying down immutable rules. She was speaking of the situation generally that applies and there will always be exceptions.
	
	
	I am mindful too of the course of the matters that arise out of the decision of Ponfield (1999) 48 NSWLR 327 which Justice Howie in Marshall [2007] NSWCCA 24 at [37] said were relevant matters in determining the factors to be considered in the evaluation of the seriousness of an offence, carrying with it a standard non-parole period.
	
	
	The principal offence, referring to Ponfield criteria, was not the result of professional planning. The prisoner, whilst he had prior offences against the victim did not have a prior record of like offences. There was no specific vulnerability of the victim, although she was a young woman, she had her brother present. There was no vandalism as such. The element of damage to the property is an element of the offence which cannot be considered as a separate aggravating factor under s 21A(2). The offence was committed in a series of repeat incursions of the same premises, but while committing different categories of offending. I have already taken into account the threat of force.
	
	
	In any event, Justice Simpson in Huynh ([2005] NSWCCA 220) reflected upon the relevance of the maximum penalty of the serious indictable offence at [27] as well as the relevance of circumstances of aggravation pleaded at [29].
	
	
	Of course insofar as the prisoner’s counsel’s submissions were concerned he particularly addressed me in respect of the analysis of the objective seriousness of the offending that I am required to undertake given the fact there is a standard non-parole period. I have already indicated what my assessment is. I bear in mind of course that by reason of the decision in Muldrock (2011) 281 ALR 652, particularly at [17] - [32]. The High Court concluded that the standard non-parole period was one of many matters to be taken into account, that Courts were required to sentence offenders in accordance with what I have described as Markarian principles. The amended sections to which I earlier referred require the assessment of the middle range of objective seriousness as relevant to the standard non‑parole period to be undertaken by reference only to the objective facts and that in accordance with Muldrock and Markarian the Court is required to take into other factors in assessing the non-parole period bearing in mind that the standard non-parole period is not a starting point for such an assessment, but a guide to determining the appropriate non-parole period and thus balance of sentence to be imposed.
	
	
	So far as his counsel’s submissions in this regard are of concern he noted the absence of physical contact with the complainant in relation to the principal offence. There was no pleading of intimidation. There was conceded, as I said, the threat of force but the prisoner did not actually have any violent contact with the victim. I have already noted what was said about the criminal history and other submissions made about the mental health of the prisoner which I have taken into account in my earlier findings.
	
	
	The matter that counsel for the prisoner particularly stressed was the issue of the prisoner’s prospects of rehabilitation. He accepted that the prospects were guarded but he noted the prisoner’s willingness to abide by conditions of supervision and, of course, the opinion of the psychologist. I am prepared to accept on balance in regard to the totality of the evidence that there are some prospects of rehabilitation. But they are guarded. To be governed, I would have thought, primarily by the capacity of the prisoner to avoid the abuse of alcohol and drugs.
	
	
	It was conceded, notwithstanding s 5 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act that I should impose a term of imprisonment. It was noted that when he is released he will have strong family support and will live with his grandmother.
	
	
	I should also take into account his disadvantaged background as a relevant fact, which I do. This is relevant to assessment the way in which his behaviour may have been fashion in part by forces beyond his control. I am required to take into account, as was submitted, the time that had been spent in custody.
	
	
	Of course, in this matter, I am required also to have regard to the purposes of sentencing pursuant to s 3A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and it is important to note that there should be an element of general deterrence in the sentences imposed. The community has long since ceased to be tolerant of crimes of violence committed against women, young or old, by people who believe that they have got the right to act in the way they do simply because they have been in some type of relationship. The prisoner should understand that he had absolutely no right to behave the way he did from the very beginning and the fact that he could not see that his attentions were unwanted is not a matter of mitigation and certainly no excuse for his behaviour.
	
	
	In Victoria at this very moment there is a Royal Commission into the suffering of women at the hands of men who resort to violence, threats of intimidation, damaging property and breaching Court orders to suffocate, in a metaphorical sense, their former partners. The prisoner should understand that the sentence I impose reflects, as the purposes of sentences prescribe, the requirement that the Court recognise the need not only to give weight to general deterrence but also to deter the prisoner from further offending and to protect the community, in this case including the victim from the offender.
	
	
	I appreciate the sentence I impose involves temporary incapacitation. But it is an incapacitation to give the prisoner more time to reflect upon the matters that he claimed he reflected upon before he came to give evidence before me. I have to make him accountable for his actions and denounce his conduct to recognise the harm done to the victim. I appreciate, notwithstanding noting the prior conviction of assaulting the victim quite unacceptably, that the prisoner caused no physical injury to the victim in the course of these various crimes. However, the emotional toll on the victim, even though I do not have a victim impact statement, must have been enormous. A very young woman, pregnant, in circumstances that her former partner will not leave her alone and having the fear of him just turning up and materialising inside a room, reflects a very serious state of affairs. The fact the prisoner may be immature is a matter to take into account. But again, cannot excuse what he has done. Of course ultimately the prisoner is to be adequately punished.
	
	
	I have had regard obviously to all the submissions the parties have put and endeavoured to bring them together in a coherent fashion with the evidence that was available to the Court but notwithstanding the relative youth of the prisoner, which I acknowledge, notwithstanding the lack of significant criminal history but for the matters that arose in May/June 2014 it is clear that what I regard at this stage of the prisoner’s life is a substantial term of imprisonment must be imposed.
	
	
	The term of imprisonment for the principal offence will be partially accumulative, as I have indicated earlier upon the sentences for the breach of apprehended domestic violence orders.
	
	
	I must say in passing I have referred to mitigating factors in part, particularly the prospects of rehabilitation. At the time of offending it must be made very clear that the prisoner could not be said to not have any record or significant record of previous convictions. The findings of guilt in June 2014 were very significant in my view. He was not a person of good character. I cannot say that he is unlikely to reoffend. The prisoner has expressed remorse and at this stage on balance I am prepared to accept that he has shown remorse but it has been a long time coming and it is not of such weight as might have been if the prisoner’s remorse had been more readily and earlier expressed. His plea of guilty is itself a relevant mitigating factor but for that he gets a particular discount.
	
	
	With regard to his record I conclude by saying, although I do not find it as an aggravating factor, it gets very close to the mark given the character of the offences committed in May and June 2014, it certainly is a criminal history in total that does not entitle him to any particular leniency or special leniency.
	
	
	You can stand up, thanks very much, Mr Frankiewicz.
	
	
	In relation to the principal offence, that is the offence for which you are committed for sentence, you are convicted.
	
	
	However, before I turn to the sentence for that matter I will have to sentence you in relation to the other matters. I just have to make one amendment, sequence 1 will have a different commencement made.
	
	
	In relation to sequences 2, 5 and 6, they are the three offences of contravene apprehended domestic violence order or restriction under apprehended domestic violence order, that is on 15 August and 18 August, in respect of sequence 2 you are convicted. You are sentenced to a term of nine months’ imprisonment to date from 18 August 2014, that will expire on 17 May 2015.
	
	
	In respect of the second offence committed that day, that is, the sequence 5 offence, you are convicted. You are sentenced to 12 months imprisonment, that shall date from 18 August 2014 and expire on 17 August 2015.
	
	
	In respect of the contravene apprehended domestic violence order sequence 6, this is in its terms the least serious of the offences, although the last in time, you are sentenced to six months imprisonment from 18 August, expiring on 17 April 2015, and commencing on 18 August 2014.
	
	
	In respect of sequence 1, because it was committed at the same time and intimately connected to the principal offence, you are convicted, you are sentenced to six months imprisonment but that six months imprisonment shall date from 18 February 2015 and expire on 17 August 2016.
	
	
	In respect of the principal offence you are convicted. You are sentenced to a term of imprisonment by way of a non-parole period of one year six months to date from 18 February 2015, to expire on 17 August 2016. The balance of sentence will be two years and three months. The balance of sentence will expire on my calculation on 17 November 2018.
	
	
	That means the effectively non-parole period for you is two years and it will be a matter for the Parole Authority whether you are released to custody at the end of that two year period.
	
	
	You can take a seat, thanks very much. Yes. Thank you. Madam Crown, are there any technical matters?
	
	
	BLACK: I don’t think so. Can your Honour just confirm the length of this sentence for sequence 6, please?
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Sequence 6 is a conviction and a sentence of six months from 18 August 2014, expiring on 17 February 2015 but I have made the sequence 1 offence concurrent with the principal offence, that is, partially accumulative on some of the other sentences because it was committed at the same as the principal offence. In fact the principal offence is the manifestation of the contravention of the ADVO.
	
	
	BLACK: Yes.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: By his presence in the house and all that sort of thing.
	
	
	BLACK: Yes. I understand, your Honour.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: But the three sentences for sequence 2, 5 and 6 are concurrent with one another.
	
	
	BLACK: Yes, your Honour.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: But the sentences in relation to sequence 1 and the principal offence are partly accumulative upon those three sentences. So the total sentence on my calculation as I told the prisoner at the start will be four years three months imprisonment with a non-parole period of two years. He will be eligible for release to parole on 17 August 2017 having come into custody on 18 August - sorry, 2016, I should say.
	
	
	BLACK: 16. Yes.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Having come into custody, I should say, on 18 August 2014.
	
	
	BLACK: Yes.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: I’m sorry. Yes.
	
	
	BLACK: Those dates look correct to me, your Honour.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Sorry.
	
	
	BLACK: I think those dates are fine.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: I will double-check them in the orders of course, if there’s a slip of the tongue but effectively four years three months from 18 August, non‑parole period two years expiring on 17 August 2016.
	
	
	BLACK: Yes.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: You will be eligible for release to parole in August next year. Whether you are released to parole will be a matter for the Parole Authority but you will be subject to parole supervision for two years three months. If you in any way contravene your parole, particularly by in any way threatening or going near, without appropriate Court orders to permit it to occur, the victim or the child you will be taken back into custody.
	
	
	OFFENDER: Yes.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: It is in your interests ultimately. If you want to have a relationship with your child for you to not only comply with your parole conditions but to accept the fact that the relationship is over, to accept the fact that your conduct towards the victim was totally unacceptable and to accept the fact that you’ve got no rights whatsoever to molest, interfere or harass her in anyway whatsoever.
	
	
	OFFENDER: Yes.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Right. Thank you. Yes, thank you, you’re excused, thank you very much, sir. Do you want to quickly speak to your client or not, before he goes?
	
	
	HEENAN: If there’s enough time I’ll go downstairs.

		18 December 2015",2015-05-28 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2703333,R v Cullen [2015] NSWSC 677,"Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: At or approaching the conclusion of my summing up to the jury, Mr Terracini SC for the accused sought a direction in the following terms:
	


“You may think it would be difficult for the accused if you accepted his account to distinguish between the thought processes associated with self-defence and provocation during a struggle where provocative statements are made together with at least one stabbing wound inflicted upon him and to compartmentalise them with any precision.”


	
	I declined to direct the jury in the terms requested. I marked the proposed direction as MFI 31. My reasons for declining to direct the jury in these terms are as follows.
	
	
	The accused pleaded not guilty to murder but guilty to manslaughter. It was made clear at the earliest stage of the trial that the accused admitted killing the deceased and that his plea was predicated upon a contention that the Crown could not negative self-defence and provocation. That approach necessarily although not exclusively focussed attention upon the deteriorating relationship between the accused and the deceased over a period of some years as their marriage disintegrated and which culminated in the violent death of the deceased.
	
	
	The accused killed the deceased at the premises of an anglers’ club at Taren Point of which he was a member. On the morning of 22 January 2014 the accused and the deceased attended Sutherland Local Court, where they appeared before a magistrate in proceedings commenced by the accused seeking compensation for the cost of repairs to his car. The proceedings were in a sense a metaphor for the state of the marriage, as the comments of the magistrate appear to recognise. The outcome on the day was not conclusive or favourable to the accused who can be seen on CCTV footage to leave the court in an agitated state ahead of the deceased. The deceased lived in an apartment close to the court and drove straight there. She was immediately followed by the accused.
	
	
	At about 10.25am or so, neighbours in the same apartment block heard screaming and moaning coming from the underground car park area of the premises. Subsequent forensic analysis revealed the presence of drops of the deceased’s blood in her garage and on her car. Court papers from the Sutherland Local Court proceedings were found strewn in the garage. The accused then left the car park in his white Hyundai motor vehicle. It seems clear that the deceased was at that time still alive but contained within the boot of that car.
	
	
	The accused drove to the Boating Camping and Fishing store at Taren Point. He arrived there at approximately 12.15pm. Evidence in the trial included CCTV footage of his car in the car park area of the store as well as internal footage of the accused inside it. He can be seen clearly inside the store selecting a shirt and a set of filleting knives which he purchased at the register at 12.17pm. He was issued with a receipt for his purchase that contained his name. It is an available inference that the deceased was still inside the boot of the car at this time. There is no evidence to explain the time delay between when the accused drove from the deceased’s apartment and when he arrived at the store.
	
	
	The evidence is also silent as to what precisely happened between the time when the car left the store and when it arrived at the Taren Point anglers’ club location. Vehicular access to the club required a key to unlock a boom gate at the top of a driveway. The accused had a key for that purpose. He drove into the club premises. When the deceased was finally discovered, she was slumped in a kneeling position behind the accused’s vehicle on a grassy area adjacent to the clubhouse. The car was parked a short distance away. It was splashed or smeared with blood and the fishing knives were on the grass beside it. The deceased’s hair was found in the boot of the car and her blood was found on the back bumper and inside the boot.
	
	
	It is conceded by the accused that the killing of the deceased occurred in what was a frenzied attack upon her. The nature and extent of the wounds sustained by her bear testament to that fact. He throat was cut deeply on both sides of her neck and her body was pierced with several significant stab wounds. Two of these wounds to her body were likely to have caused her death. In addition the deceased’s left and dominant hand was significantly lacerated by what seems clearly to have been defensive wounds inflicted in opposing the attack.
	
	
	It was the accused’s case at trial, elicited from evidence in the Crown case and from a forensic expert called by the accused, that the Crown had failed to negative the possibility that he acted either or both in self-defence and under the influence of provocation from the deceased. There was no issue that his self-defensive response, if that is what it was, was disproportionate to the threat he perceived.
	
	
	The accused was apprehended at the scene as he emerged from the mangroves that formed the coastline at that point on Woolooware Bay. He was punctured with several stab wounds upon his upper left chest and abdomen and was later found to have sustained a punctured left lung. As the result of that injury his face and neck were significantly distorted by subcutaneous emphysema caused by the escape and entrapment of air in his chest, neck and face. His condition is visually obvious in a video recording made by the police at the scene. Part of what the accused said in the course of that brief interview includes the following:
	


“Q.16. The wounds you've got in your chest and your stomach, where did they come from?

A. I think one might have been from her and the ones around my heart were from me.

…

Q.18 O.K. So they’re your fishing knives. So what, what’s ultimately happened today then?

A. We, we went to Court today. Uh, regarding a civil matter and we were talking and she started taunting me with her sex life and I lost control and we had a fight, that's it. And I just didn't want to live no more after that.”


	
	A significant issue in the trial revolved around whether or not the accused sustained an injury at the hands of the deceased. That became relevant to the question of self-defence, and whether anything that the accused did in performing acts that killed the deceased were or could have been in response to an actual or perceived threat or attack upon him emanating from the deceased. It was also said to be relevant to the issue of provocation. However, the issue of provocation was more fundamentally grounded upon a loss of self-control said to have been caused by verbal taunting close to the time of the killing as well as an historical build up of uncontrollable emotion as the accused discovered that the deceased had been having a relationship with a younger man following their separation in about October 2013.
	
	
	The jury were directed by me upon the legal elements of self-defence and provocation. With one minor correction, at the request of the Crown, to something I said in the course of my summing up concerning the ordinary person test for the second limb of the provocation calculus, neither counsel relevantly required any correction or augmentation of anything that I said to the jury. The one exception to that proposition is the defence request for a direction in the terms set out above.
	
	
	The accused did not give evidence in his trial. Any conclusions that the jury might ultimately arrive at concerning his thought processes, to adopt the words of the proposed direction, must therefore be based upon inference from the whole of the evidence in the case but without his evidence about it. That evidence, however, does include the things said by the accused to the police at the scene immediately following the killing.
	
	
	The burden of Mr Terracini’s argument in favour of the proposed direction is that it would be, and in this case it must have been, extremely difficult for the accused or for someone in his position, rationally to have considered and analysed all of the competing physical and emotional influences at play when he performed the acts that caused the death. Mr Terracini’s proposition is, in my words rather than his, that the jury should have been reminded of these things in order to understand that an accused in general and Mr Cullen in particular, is not to be judged by standards of calm reflection or studied logic. On the contrary, Mr Terracini was quick to emphasise that the accused was confronted with a dramatic and violent situation, albeit to one extent or another the result of his own conduct, from the consequences of which he ought not in the circumstances be expected to have extricated himself as he might have chosen to do with the benefit of hindsight.
	
	
	As arguably compelling as that proposition may appear to be, the proposed direction by which it is hoped the proposition may be given some additional emphasis or effect is in my view no more and no less than a restatement of the wisdom that appears to underpin the nature of the defences of self-defence and provocation in the first place. The proposed direction does not in my opinion assist the jury to understand these defences but on the contrary may have served to create confusion in their minds. The defences are separate and distinct, and a failure to negative either of them in this case would command a verdict of not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter. The concept that the jury should have considered the accused’s ability to compartmentalise his thought processes at the time of the offence for the purpose of analysing the Crown’s success in negativing these defences is no part of their role when the defences are properly understood. The certain fact is that the events out of which these separate defences might simultaneously or sequentially have emerged were traumatic, frenzied and potentially confusing. However, that is not some further basis for suggesting to the jury, in addition to a proper direction about the principles governing these defences, that they also examine the possibility that the accused might not have been able at the time to discern whether he was acting in self-defence or under provocation or both or to what extent.
	
	
	I accept, and it is reasonable to expect that the jury might accept, that the accused would have been confronted, to the extent that it is relevant, with the difficulty identified in the proposed direction. In my opinion, that difficulty does not have a relevance or independent status beyond its implicit identification or characterisation in the standard jury directions about self-defence and provocation. The proposed direction would in my view have had the potential to mislead the jury and to lead them to follow an erroneous process of reasoning.

		03 June 2015",2015-05-28 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2703334,Aktar v R [2015] NSWCCA 123,"Judgment


	
	HOEBEN CJ at CL: I agree with Wilson J. I reserve my position in relation to the correct interpretation of s 21A(2)(eb) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1995 until an occasion when the matter has been fully argued by both sides. In saying that, I do not in any way wish to deprecate the interpretation of Wilson J. I also agree with Wilson J's comment concerning the applicant's submission that the sentence imposed on him was a ""crushing” one. Hyperbole of this kind, apart from being inaccurate, is quite unhelpful.
	



	
	RA HULME J: I agree with the reasons of Wilson J and the order she proposes with only one qualification. In relation to Ground 4 her Honour has recorded (at [47]) what I said in Melbom v R [2013] NSWCCA 210 about the construction of s 21A(2)(eb). Given this is another case in which the point was not fully argued I do not wish to say any more on the subject.
	



	
	WILSON J: The applicant seeks leave pursuant to s.5(1)(c) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 to appeal against sentences imposed upon him by her Honour Judge Payne, sitting at the Parramatta District Court on 4 September 2014. The applicant had entered pleas of guilty to two counts of indecent assault contrary to s.61L of the Crimes Act 1900. Such offences carry a maximum penalty of 5 years imprisonment. Two further offences, being another charge of indecent assault and a charge of assault occasioning actual bodily harm (AOABH), were taken into account by her Honour pursuant to s.33 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 when sentence was imposed for the first offence of indecent assault (count 1a).
	
	
	The matter had originally proceeded as a committal for trial, with the applicant entering pleas of not guilty at arraignment before the District Court. His pleas of guilty were entered subsequently, after a trial date had been fixed. Count 1a had been included on the indictment presented by the Crown at arraignment as an alternative to a more serious charge, that being an offence of attempt sexual intercourse without consent. The applicant’s plea to the alternative count was accepted by the Crown in full satisfaction of the indictment. The sentencing judge allowed a discount of 10% on the sentences that would otherwise have been imposed in recognition of the utilitarian value of the pleas.
	
	
	In relation to count 2, the second indecent assault offence, her Honour imposed a head sentence of 1 year and 1 month imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 6 months specified, commencing on 4 September 2014. In relation to count 1a, and taking into account the two offences before the Court on a Form 1 document, her Honour imposed a head sentence of 1 year and 9 months imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 9 months fixed. There was some accumulation, with that sentence to commence on 4 March 2015.
	
	
	The overall sentence was imprisonment for 2 years and 3 months with a non-parole period of 1 year and 3 months specified. The earliest date for release to parole is 3 December 2015. The sentence expires on 3 December 2016.
	


The Facts of the Offences


	
	The facts of the offences were before her Honour as a statement of agreed facts. The following summary is taken from that document, which was part of the Crown’s case on sentence.
	
	
	The offences all arose from a single incident on 22 January 2013, and involved the same complainant. The complainant has some family connection to the applicant and was regarded by him, and regarded herself, as his cousin. The two had grown up together.
	
	
	On 22 January 2013 the applicant drove to the complainant’s home, arriving there at about 9pm. The asserted purpose of his visit was to see other family members who had been staying with the complainant until earlier that day. The applicant and the complainant chatted for a time, with the applicant eventually introducing the subject of his marriage into the conversation, telling the complainant that he had been unfaithful.
	
	
	It soon became clear to the complainant that the applicant’s interest in her was sexual, and she became frightened. She told him that he was “barking up the wrong tree”. The applicant responded that he was “picking the right girl”. He refused to leave when the complainant asked him to do so and, instead, approached her as she sat on a chair, and picked her up. He carried the complainant to a sofa. After laying the complainant on the sofa, the applicant lay on top of her, pinning her down with the weight of his body. Despite her repeated requests that he leave, the applicant began kissing and licking the complainant, and touching her breasts.
	
	
	When the applicant stood up the complainant tried to run away, but he took hold of her forcefully, and carried her upstairs towards her bedroom. The complainant was struggling and demanding to be released, but the applicant continued towards the bedroom. In the process the applicant struck the complainant’s leg against a door, causing bruising. This injury, occasioned during the struggle, is reflected by the charge of AOABH, which was before the court on the Form 1 document.
	
	
	On reaching the complainant’s bedroom, the applicant threw the complainant onto her bed and got on top of her. After removing the complainant’s upper clothing, he began to kiss and fondle her exposed breasts. This act was reflected by the offence of indecent assault that was also before the Court on the Form 1.
	
	
	After forcing the victim’s hand onto his exposed erect penis the applicant moved his penis towards the complainant’s mouth. The applicant caused his penis to move against the complainant’s exposed chest area. This act is reflected by the first s.61L offence, count 1a.
	
	
	The applicant began pulling at the leggings the complainant was wearing, but she begged him not to, telling him that she was menstruating. The applicant desisted and stood up. When the complainant tried to get up from the bed the applicant pushed her back onto the bed and began to again kiss and lick her upper body. This assault was charged as the second s.61L offence, count 2.
	
	
	Soon after, the applicant got up and left the bedroom, telling the complainant that he would return the following evening.
	
	
	After he left the complainant sat in her bedroom crying. She told her mother and brother what had happened the following day. The applicant was confronted by the complainant’s family when he arrived at the house that next evening. He denied any wrongdoing.
	
	
	The matter was reported to police that same night. Observations were made by investigating police of bruising to the complainant’s throat, and lower left leg.
	
	
	The applicant was charged on 24 January 2013. He refused to be interviewed by police.
	


The Proposed Appeal


	
	If granted leave, the applicant seeks to plead five grounds of appeal, expressed as follows.
	



	
	“Her Honour erred by imposing sentence was manifestly excessive including the total effective sentence imposed (in relation to all counts).
	
	
	Her Honour erred in accumulating the sentence.
	
	
	Her Honour erred in taking in the exercise of her discretion in assessing the allowances to be made for special circumstances conceded by parties in relation to the Applicant.
	
	
	Her Honour erred by imposing sentence as aggravating feature (p7) that the offence was committed in the victim’s home.
	
	
	Her Honour fell into error in concluding that the objective seriousness of the offence was “at higher end” (remarks, tp7.6) category in relation to count 1a, 2 and Form 1 count 1.” [sic]
	



	
	Rather curiously, the statement of the applicant’s proposed grounds of appeal contains a statement of particulars following each ground. It is not intended to set out here the particulars advanced against each proposed ground; the matters raised will be dealt with when considering the individual grounds.
	
	
	Adopting the approach of the Crown, I propose to deal with grounds 2 to 5 before considering ground 1.
	


Ground 2: “Her Honour erred in accumulating the sentence”


	
	As can be seen from the details of the sentence set out at [5] above, the sentence imposed for count 1a (taking into account the Form 1 offences) was to commence on 4 March 2015, six months after the commencement of the sentence imposed for count 2.
	
	
	The applicant complains that her Honour’s discretion in this regard miscarried, and that she failed to have regard to all of the circumstances of the case when determining the level of concurrency / accumulation of sentence. Referring to the principle of totality the applicant contends that the sentencing judge should have regarded the discrete offences as part of a single course of events, and considered imposing a wholly concurrent sentence for both counts.
	
	
	In an ex tempore judgment given immediately following the tender of evidence and submissions on sentence made by the parties, her Honour specifically referred to the fact that there was a need for some level of accumulation of sentence. It is by no means apparent that she overlooked this aspect of the sentencing exercise.
	
	
	The degree of accumulation is, as the applicant noted, a discretionary matter and, subject to the application of principle, how the discretion is exercised is a matter for the sentencing judge: LG v R [2012] NSWCCA 249 at [24]; Panchal v R; R v Panchal [2014] NSWCCA 275 at [81].
	
	
	There is no rule that determines whether sentences are to be imposed concurrently, with a degree of accumulation, or wholly consecutively. In Cahyadi v R [2007] NSWCCA 1; (2007) 168 A Crim R 41 at [27], Howie J said,
	


“The issue is determined by the application of the principle of totality of criminality: can the sentence for one offence comprehend and reflect the criminality for the other offence? If it can, the sentences ought to be concurrent otherwise there is a risk that the combined sentences will exceed that which is warranted to reflect the total criminality of the two offences. If not, the sentences should be at least partly cumulative otherwise there is a risk that the total sentence will fail to reflect the total criminality of the two offences. This is so regardless of whether the two offences represent two discrete acts of criminality or can be regarded as part of a single episode of criminality.”


	
	Whilst the fact that two offences occurred in the course of the same conduct can indicate that concurrency of sentence is appropriate, that is very much a matter for judgment, having regard to the circumstances of the individual matter. The ultimate consideration is whether the degree of concurrency or accumulation provides for sentences that properly reflect the offending conduct.
	
	
	In the applicant’s case the offences all occurred during a single course of conduct, but that does not of itself dictate that the sentences for the two offences, taking into account the Form 1 offences, should have been ordered to be served concurrently. There are other relevant considerations.
	
	
	The offences occurred over a relatively protracted period of time, in the face of the complainant’s repeated protests, and against her struggles to be free. The acts were quite discrete, and there was some temporal break between each. The second offence was committed after the complainant had attempted to flee, and after the applicant had forcefully pushed her back onto her bed. Each offence contributed to a significant level of criminality, with the whole being somewhat greater in my view than the sum of its parts.
	
	
	It was necessary for the overall sentence to reflect the totality of the criminality involved. Whilst minds can reasonably differ on the level of concurrency appropriate in any particular case, wholly concurrent sentences in this matter would not, in my view, have served that purpose.
	
	
	The approach taken by her Honour was within her discretion and in accordance with principle. The applicant has failed to establish error.
	


Ground 3: “Her Honour erred in taking in the exercise of her discretion in assessing the allowances to be made for special circumstances conceded by parties in relation to the Applicant.”


	
	By this ground, the applicant appears to complain that her Honour did not make a sufficient adjustment to the structure of the sentence to reflect her finding of special circumstances, in circumstances where, in the proceedings before her Honour, the Crown did not dispute that such a finding could be made.
	
	
	If that interpretation of this ground as pleaded is correct, it is difficult to see how any argument in support of it could be sustained.
	
	
	Ordinarily, s.44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1995 creates a restriction upon the structure of a sentence to be imposed, such that the non-parole period may not fall below seventy-five per cent of the total term of the sentence. The exception is where a finding of special circumstances is made.
	
	
	Where a finding of special circumstances is made, the Court must record its reasons for making that finding. In making a finding in the applicant’s favour, her Honour referred to the fact that the applicant had not previously been incarcerated, that he would require assistance to reintegrate with the community, and that he would need treatment and assistance to address his offending behaviour, services which were better provided in a community setting.
	
	
	Having made that finding, her Honour varied the usual statutory ratio of sentence very favourably to the applicant. The non-parole period (“NPP”) specified for count 1a is 42.8% of the overall term; for count 2 it is 46.1%. Expressed as a percentage of the total sentence, the NPP is 55.5%. This represents a significant variation in the structure of sentence, and one which imports a considerable measure of leniency.
	
	
	The degree or extent of any adjustment of the statutory ratio is very much a matter within the discretion of the sentencing judge: Caristo v R [2011] NSWCCA 7 at [31]. Having found that the applicant would require a longer than usual period on parole to facilitate his reintegration to and treatment in the community, the sentencing judge fixed the NPP so as to allow the applicant a longer than usual period for that to occur.
	
	
	In his written submissions, the applicant asserts that “the applicant’s need to access services from Community Services and be free for these purposes was an important consideration that needed to be given weight and the discretion properly exercised”, and “her Honour having recognised that there was a requirement for the treatment then gone ahead and put a barrier for the applicant to engage the services”. Nothing is advanced in support of these assertions, and there is nothing in the evidence that was before the sentencing judge that is capable of sustaining them.
	
	
	A period of one year in which to have the benefit of supervision and support in the community represents a generous period for the applicant to achieve rehabilitation and reintegration in the circumstances of this matter. There is no basis upon which to conclude that a relatively lengthy period of parole such as this is in fact inadequate to those purposes.
	
	
	It must be remembered that rehabilitation is only one of the purposes of sentencing referred to in s.3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1995. The others are punishment of the offender, deterrence (general and specific), ensuring the protection of the community, making the offender accountable for his or her actions, denunciation, and recognition of harm. The NPP is the minimum period for which an offender must be imprisoned to properly reflect the gravity of the crime and the manifold purposes of sentencing: R v Simpson [2001] 53 NSWLR 704 at [59]; R v Cramp [2004] NSWCCA 264 at [34]; MD v R [2015] NSWCCA 37 at [39].
	
	
	The variation to the ordinary ratio of sentence was here markedly generous, and cannot evidence a failure by the sentencing judge to give proper consideration to this aspect of the sentencing exercise. There was no miscarriage of her Honour’s discretion.
	
	
	This ground is incapable of being made good.
	


Ground 4: “Her Honour erred by imposing sentence as aggravating feature (p7) that the offence was committed in the victim’s home.”


	
	This ground complains of error in the application by the sentencing judge of s.21A(2)(eb) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1995.
	
	
	In her remarks on sentence, her Honour said this:
	


“The complainant considered the offender to be her cousin as he was related to her blood cousin. She was home alone. He said he had come to visit relatives but the facts clearly state that the offender was aware those persons had been taken back by the complainant’s mother, the three girls had been taken back to the offender’s mother’s house earlier that day. It is a feature of aggravation pursuant to s21A(2)(eb) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act that the offence was committed in the home of the victim. The victim was clearly entitled to feel safe in her own home and it was because of the relationship between the two of them that she allowed him to come into the home.”


	
	Recent decisions of this Court have given some consideration to the proper interpretation of s.21A(2)(eb).
	
	
	In both Melbom v R [2013] NSWCCA 210 and Montero v R [2013] NSWCCA 214; (2013) 234 A Crim R 532, the Court considered the meaning of s.21A(2)(eb) and how it should be applied, although no concluded view was taken in the absence of full argument from the parties.
	
	
	In Melbom, the Crown in its written submissions challenged the narrow interpretation that this Court had placed upon s.21A(2)(eb). At the hearing of the appeal, it abandoned that challenge. Referring to that abandonment, RA Hulme J said (at [41]),
	


“The Crown abandoned its proposed alternative argument in relation to this ground and conceded the correctness of those decisions. This is despite the fact that the plain words of s 21A(2)(eb) do not support the limitation that this Court has placed on their application. It is also despite the fact that it was never intended by Parliament that there should be the constraint upon their application that this Court has imposed: see the second reading speech of the Attorney-General, New South Wales Legislative Council, Parliamentary Debates, Hansard, 17 October 2007 (p 2667ff) where it was said that it would be ""an aggravating circumstance when victims are assaulted in their own homes ... even if it is also the home of the accused"". However, given the concession by the Crown, now is not the occasion for reconsideration of what has been said previously in this Court on the subject.”


	
	Both Simpson J and Price J agreed with his Honour’s comment.
	
	
	In Montero, RA Hulme J referred to Melbom, and noted again the inconsistency between the words of the statute and the narrow interpretation of the words by the Court. Leeming JA agreed with his Honour.
	
	
	In Pasoski v R [2014] NSWCCA 309 at [54] Meagher JA (with whom Hidden J and RS Hulme AJ agreed) found that the sentencing judge was in error in concluding that sexual assault offences were aggravated by the fact that each occurred in the complainant’s home, in circumstances where the offender was the complainant’s de facto partner, and lived at the premises. Meagher JA referred to EK [2010] NSWCCA 199; (2010) 208 A Crim R 157 as authority for his conclusion. (EK is referred to below, at [54].)
	
	
	There is clearly some tension between decisions of this Court as to the proper interpretation of s.21A(2)(eb).
	
	
	Section 21A(2)(eb) is as follows.
	


“(1)   In determining the appropriate sentence for an offence, the court is to take into account the following matters:

(a)   the aggravating factors referred to in subsection (2) that are relevant and known to the court,

[(b) – (c)]

(2)   The aggravating factors to be taken into account in determining the appropriate sentence for an offence are as follows:

[(a) – (ea)]

(eb)   the offence was committed in the home of the victim or any other person,

[(f) – (p)]”


	
	In Ingham v R [2011] NSWCCA 88, a decision that has hitherto represented the interpretation of this Court of s.21A(2)(eb), the provision was said to apply only in circumstances where the offender was an intruder.
	
	
	That interpretation was consistent with the position at common law which, prior to the insertion into the Act of s.21A(2)(eb) on 1 January 2008, was that an offence was only aggravated by the fact that it was committed in the victim’s home if the offender was an intruder unlawfully within the premises: R v Preston (Court of Criminal Appeal (NSW), Dunford J, Smart J and Handley JA, 9 April 1997, unrep); R v Gazi Comert [2004] NSWCCA 125 per Hidden and Hislop JJ at [29]; EK v R supra, at [79] per RA Hulme J.
	
	
	Although Ingham has been followed in a number of decisions (such as NLR v R [2011] NSWCCA 246; BIP v R [2011] NSWCCA 224; and DS v R [2012] NSWCCA 159), there is considerable force in the proposition that the interpretation and application of s.21A(2)(eb) as noted in Ingham is too narrow, and fails to give effect to the express intention of the Legislature to broaden the common law rule upon which the section is (lightly) based. Proper construction of the provision should, in my opinion, include its application to offences committed within residential premises by an offender lawfully present.
	
	
	There is nothing in the wording of s.21A(2)(eb) to suggest that it must be narrowly construed to identically reflect the common law; indeed, its broad language (“in the home of the victim or any other person”) suggests the contrary.
	
	
	If the language used by the Legislature suggests that the provision could or should be more broadly construed than has hitherto been the case, arguably, the ordinary rules of statutory construction should apply to a more thorough consideration of the provision and its interpretation.
	
	
	Statutory interpretation in New South Wales is guided by the Interpretation Act 1987. Section 33 of that Act provides:
	


“In the interpretation of a provision of an Act or statutory rule, a construction that would promote the purpose or object underlying the Act or statutory rule (whether or not that purpose or object is expressly stated in the Act or statutory rule or, in the case of a statutory rule, in the Act under which the rule was made) shall be preferred to a construction that would not promote that purpose or object.”


	
	Applying s.33 in Project Blue Sky Inc. & Ors v Australian Broadcasting Authority (1998) 194 CLR 355, McHugh, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ said at [78],
	


“However, the duty of a court is to give the words of a statutory provision a meaning that the legislature is taken to have intended them to have [...].”


	
	The intention of the Legislature in introducing s.21A(2)(eb) can be gleaned from the Second Reading Speech of the Crimes (Sentencing Amendment) Bill 2007 delivered in the Legislative Council of the Parliament by the then Attorney-General on 17 October 2007 (and recorded at p.2667 of the Hansard).
	


“Item [3] [of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Amendment Bill 2007] also enacts section 21A (2)(eb). It will aggravate an offence that was committed within a victim's home or another person's home. This aggravating factor preserves the notion of sanctity of the home, whereby individuals are entitled to feel safe from harm of any kind. This protection should apply in any home. The courts have long recognised that it is an aggravating circumstance when victims are assaulted in their own homes. The Government takes the position that any offence committed in the home of the victim, even if it is also the home of the accused, or in the home of another person, violates that person's reasonable expectation of safety and security. However, when a crime is committed in and from the accused's own home—for example, if the offender is committing computer or fraud offences—and no other person is present, the aggravation will not apply.”


	
	It is significant that, after referring to the common law recognition of an assault upon a victim in his or her home as an aggravating factor, the Attorney then set out the Government’s “position” on the issue, thereby appearing to clearly distinguish it from that which previously applied at common law. The distinction is preserved by the following sentence, in which the Attorney specifically noted that a victim was entitled to the safety of his or her home, “even if it is also the home of the accused, or [in] the home of another person”. 
	
	
	Implicit in the Attorney’s comments in the extracted passage is recognition of the common law as it was at that point, distinguished by the expression of a clear intention to broaden the application of the principle to include by statute the commission of offences occurring “even in” an offender’s home. Ordinarily an offender in his or her own home could be presumed to be there lawfully. Accordingly, the Parliament must have intended that, by introducing s.21A(2)(eb), the feature of aggravation as it had operated at common law would be broadened to include offences which occurred in a residence where an offender was lawfully present.
	
	
	It seems clear that the legislature intended to recognise the additional distress occasioned to a victim (and consequently the additional criminality of the offence) when the home – a place of safety and refuge – is sullied by the commission within it of a crime. The destruction of a victim’s sense of security and repose at home is the same whether the offender was lawfully present or not. The right of all citizens to be free from attack or other crime in their own home, regardless of the basis upon which the offender was present, must be recognised and protected.
	
	
	In the present case, the applicant did not direct any submissions to the proper interpretation of s.21A(2)(eb), or refer to the tension in the authorities regarding its proper construction. Whilst the Crown did consider the issue in its submissions, in the absence of submissions from both parties this is not an appropriate occasion on which to make further comment; however, I respectfully agree with the comments of RA Hulme J in Melbom, and the interpretation there suggested.
	
	
	Even setting aside the question of the proper construction of s.21A(2)(eb), I am not persuaded that there was any error in the way that the sentencing judge approached this matter. Although the applicant contended in his written submissions that he had the right to be at the complainant’s home, he in fact had no such lawful right.
	
	
	Although there was evidence before the sentencing judge that the applicant attended the complainant’s home for a spurious purpose – that is, to call upon family members whom he knew to have already left the house, it may be accepted for present purposes that the applicant was initially a guest in the complainant’s home, and lawfully inside the premises. His status changed however, from the moment the complainant told him to leave the premises, that being prior to the commission of the offences.
	
	
	In the circumstances of this case it was entirely open on the evidence for her Honour to conclude that the applicant exploited his position as a trusted family member permitted to enter the complainant’s home, and subsequently abused the complainant in what should have been the safety of her home. The evidence before the Court by way of an agreed statement of facts clearly established the aggravating feature referred to by her Honour.
	
	
	The applicant has failed to establish error, and this ground cannot be made out.
	


Ground 5: Her Honour fell into error in concluding that the objective seriousness of the offence was “at higher end” (remarks, tp7.6) category in relation to count 1a, 2 and Form 1 count 1.”


	
	Assessing the objective gravity of count 1a the sentencing judge concluded that the offence was “at the higher end”. Contrary to the applicant’s assertion, count 2 was found to be “at the lower end”.
	
	
	In his very brief written submissions, which were not expanded upon at the hearing before this Court, the applicant complains that, as the offences were not “the most serious” offences, her Honour fell into error. He additionally complains that he had no notice that her Honour might reach such a conclusion, and he was thereby denied procedural fairness. Finally, the applicant asserts error by reference to her Honour’s discussion of his criminal history. Each of these arguments appears to be misconceived.
	
	
	Whilst concluding that the offences were serious, her Honour did not find them to be in the worst category for offences of that nature, as the applicant contends. A conclusion that the gravity of the first of the offences was at the higher end was open to her Honour, who took into account:
	



	
	that the offence occurred after the applicant had physically carried the complainant upstairs, thereafter pinning her down on her bed;
	
	
	that a degree of force and coercion was used against the complainant;
	
	
	that the applicant had removed the complainant’s upper clothing; and
	
	
	that the offence involved the applicant forcing his exposed and erect penis against the complainant’s exposed chest.
	



	
	The lack of foundation for the applicant’s second complaint, that he was denied procedural fairness in relation to her Honour’s conclusions as to objective seriousness, is readily demonstrated by the record of the proceedings. In submissions on sentence, the Crown submitted to the sentencing judge that the first of the offences was a very serious offence at the higher end of any notional spectrum of gravity. This raised the issue and the applicant had an opportunity to address it in his submissions to her Honour which, in the usual way, followed those of the Crown. There was no denial of procedural fairness.
	
	
	The third complaint refers to the applicant’s criminal record, but the complaint is misplaced: an offender’s antecedents are of no relevance to an assessment of objective seriousness, and her Honour did not refer to the criminal history in this regard. The evidence concerning the applicant’s former history was referred to by her Honour in a different and entirely appropriate context, that of whether leniency could be afforded to him in light of his record of prior offences. This complaint is without substance.
	
	
	As has been repeatedly emphasised in this Court, the assessment of the objective seriousness of an offence is a matter for the sentencing judge. In Mulato v R [2006] NSWCCA 282 Spigelman CJ said (at [37]),
	


“Characterisation of the degree of objective seriousness of an offence is classically within the role of the sentencing judge in performing the task of finding facts and drawing inferences from those facts. This Court is very slow to determine such matters for itself or to set aside the judgment made by a first instance judge exercising a broadly based discretion.”


	
	Mulato has been consistently applied and followed, most recently in Sabongi v R [2015] NSWCCA 2015 25 at [65] – [69], and Gall v R; Gall v R [2015] NSWCCA 69 at [125] – [127].
	
	
	For this Court to set aside the judgment of her Honour, exercising as she was the broad discretion referred to in Mulato, the applicant would have to identify error in the sense set out in House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 499 at 505. That is, that the judge acted on a wrong principle, allowed extraneous or irrelevant matters to guide or affect her, mistook the facts, or did not take into account some material consideration.
	
	
	No error of that nature has been identified. This ground cannot be made out.
	


Ground 1: “Her Honour erred by imposing sentence was manifestly excessive including the total effective sentence imposed (in relation to all counts)”


	
	Much of what is advanced by the applicant in his written submissions is also relied upon in support of grounds 2 and 3, and has already been addressed.
	
	
	Otherwise, the applicant contends that the sentence imposed upon him was a “crushing sentence”, particularly having regard to his youth.
	
	
	For my part, I find it difficult to see how an overall sentence of 2 years and 3 months, with a NPP of 1 year and 3 months, could possibly be characterised as a “crushing sentence”, and nothing about the applicant’s age makes such a characterisation more readily acceptable.
	
	
	At the time of the commission of the offences the applicant was aged 28 years and 3 months. He was almost 30 years old when sentence was imposed upon him. Her Honour specifically referred to the applicant’s age in her remarks. Even if she had not, the applicant could hardly claim the ameliorating benefit of youth at a time when he was close to his fourth decade.
	
	
	Her Honour had regard to the applicant’s (relatively mature) age, to his antecedents, and to his future prospects of rehabilitation, which she considered to be reasonable. She took into account his need for treatment, that being part of the basis upon which special circumstances were found to exist, and gave him the benefit of a conclusion that he had expressed some remorse. She also gave some weight to the fact that all of the offences before the court were capable of summary disposition, even after noting that the applicant did not enter or offer pleas of guilty to the charges prior to committal (and potentially avail himself of summary jurisdiction in that way). The sentences, in any event, were sufficiently low as to fall beneath the jurisdictional limit individually.
	
	
	The conclusions she reached were all open to her Honour, and the sentences imposed might well be regarded as generous, having regard to the serious nature of the offending.
	
	
	A complaint of manifest excess is essentially a contention that the sentence imposed was unjust. To establish such a complaint the applicant must demonstrate that the sentence was “unreasonable or plainly unjust”: R v Dinsdale v R [2000] HCA 54; (2000) 202 CLR 321 at [325]. This has to be established, as this Court has repeatedly said, in a context where there is no single “correct” sentence, and judges at first instance are to be allowed as much flexibility in sentencing as is consonant with the application of proper principle and consistency of approach: Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; (2005) 228 CLR 357.
	
	
	The question for this Court is whether the length of the sentence is demonstrated to be outside the range of a sound sentencing discretion. In determining whether a sentence is manifestly excessive it is necessary to examine the result from the perspective of the maximum prescribed penalty, which in this case is five years imprisonment for the offences on indictment, with the same maximum penalty applicable to the offences before the Court on the Form 1 document. The Court must also consider the place which the criminal conduct occupies on the scale of seriousness of offences of the kind in question, and the personal circumstances of the offender.
	
	
	Having considered the evidence that was before the sentencing court, and her Honour’s remarks, I can detect no error in the approach taken, and no departure from the application of relevant principles.
	
	
	The applicant has failed to establish that the sentences imposed upon him were unfair or unjust.
	


Conclusion


	
	The order I propose is:
	



	
	Leave to appeal is refused.

2703338,R v Scott (No 6) [2015] NSWSC 678,"Judgment


	
	Michael Vincent Scott (the offender) was arraigned on 10 March 2015 upon an indictment which charged him with the murder of Riley Dehn, on 5 April 2013, at Cessnock in this State. He entered a plea of not guilty. A jury was empanelled and his trial commenced.
	
	
	On 30 March 2015 the offender was re-arraigned before the jury at his own request. He pleaded as follows:
	


I plead not guilty to murder, but guilty to manslaughter based on the grounds of self defence.


	
	The plea to the alternative charge of manslaughter was not accepted by the Crown in discharge of the indictment, and the trial continued.
	
	
	The jury was sent out on verdict on the afternoon of 7 April 2015. A verdict of guilty to murder was returned on 10 April 2015.
	
	
	Section 19A of the Crimes Act 1900 provides a maximum penalty of life imprisonment for murder. The Table to Division 1A of Part 4 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 fixes a standard non-parole period of 20 years. These are the statutory guideposts that the Court must take into account, along with the other facts and circumstances relevant to the assessment of sentence.
	
	
	Under s 61(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 the Court is to sentence an offender convicted of murder to life imprisonment if:
	


“… the court is satisfied that the level of culpability in the commission of the offence is so extreme that the community interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence can only be met through the imposition of that sentence.”


	
	The Crown does not submit such a finding should be made and s 61 has no application in this matter.
	


The Facts of the Offence


	
	The jury having returned a verdict of guilty, it is for this Court to find the facts proven on the evidence, consistent with the jury’s verdict: R v Isaacs (1997) 41 NSWLR 374.
	
	
	As is to be expected of the observations of those watching or involved in a dramatic and fast moving event, and particularly when the witnesses are intoxicated and the event occurs in a darkened location at night, the evidence given by those who were present during the incident in which the deceased was stabbed differed in some regards. Where there is a material difference in the accounts of witnesses, I have generally preferred the evidence of Leina Uaongo to that of others. Ms. Uaongo, alone of the witnesses to the incident, had not been drinking heavily, and was not intoxicated. With one exception – relating to her recollection of the offender as having a stick in his possession when she first saw him – I regarded her as a reliable witness whose evidence was credible, and who could be accepted beyond reasonable doubt.
	
	
	Although the offender gave the police an account of the incident in his interview with them on 6 April 2013, I do not accept his account as truthful, except insofar as there exists reliable independent evidence capable of supporting his assertions. As a general statement, I regard the offender’s account to police as having been fabricated for self-serving purposes.
	
	
	The Court finds the facts established by the evidence to be these.
	
	
	On the evening of Thursday, 4 April 2013, Riley Dehn was one of a number of young friends who had met up at the Cessnock Hotel in Cessnock for a drink, and to enjoy the karaoke that was typically held there on Thursday nights. Others of his friends and acquaintances present that night included Jake Burrage, Aiden Bowen-Duff, Charmaine Allen, Leina Uaongo, Brodie Jobson and Connor Young.
	
	
	Mr. Dehn spent the evening chatting with friends and hotel staff over drinks, and playing pool. He was observed by friends to be in a happy mood.
	
	
	Also present at the hotel that evening was Hayley Orchard and her friend Melanie O’Neil. Hayley Orchard was at that time involved in a relationship with the offender, although the relationship was troubled, and in its final days. The two had been staying with friends at a unit in Hunter Avenue at Cessnock, but the offender had been frequently absent from the unit, without telling Ms. Orchard where he was and without answering her telephone calls and messages. Such was the position on this evening, and Hayley Orchard was angry and upset with the offender.
	
	
	Throughout the evening Ms. Orchard telephoned and sent text messages to the offender, querying his whereabouts. Her mood was agitated, as she suspected the offender of seeing another woman. Ms. Orchard became increasingly drunk, and increasingly loud as the evening wore on.
	
	
	After shouting at and abusing hotel staff, Ms. Orchard and her friend were asked to leave by security officials. She argued with them, but did leave the hotel, it then being shortly before closing time at 2.30am on 5 April 2013. Having left, Ms. Orchard and her friend sat at a picnic table in a small park adjacent to the hotel, on its western side.
	
	
	Sitting at the table Ms. Orchard continued her attempts to reach the offender by telephone. She had a bottle of alcohol she had stolen earlier in the day, and was drinking from it. She was very intoxicated.
	
	
	At around that time the offender was at an address in Northcote Street at Aberdare with a young woman he had just began a relationship with, Kayla Houston. He and Ms. Houston played a game on the offender’s mobile telephone during the course of the evening and, in that context, Ms. Houston saw and read a number of text messages sent from Ms. Orchard to the offender’s telephone. They were each framed in aggressive and offensive terms and, amongst other things, demanded that the offender come to the Cessnock Hotel.
	
	
	Ms. Orchard also telephoned the offender repeatedly and managed to speak with him on at least one occasion. In that conversation, Ms. Orchard complained of having been ejected from the hotel, and told the offender that a security guard had referred to him as “a weak cunt”. She told the offender to come to the park and pick her up.
	
	
	The offender left Ms. Houston’s home and went to Cessnock, evidently on foot. At around the time that the hotel was closing and patrons began to leave, the offender walked down Wollombi Road towards the park where Ms. Orchard sat. The offender had in his possession his wallet, mobile telephone, house keys, a torch, and a tool variously referred to in the evidence as a “Leatherman” and a “multi-tool”.
	
	
	Also walking toward the park, although from the opposite direction, was Mr. Dehn, who had just left the hotel from its rear exit with Mr. Jobson, Ms. Uaongo, and other friends. Some of the group, including the deceased, were intending to walk to West Cessnock and stay at Mr. Jobson’s home for what remained of the night.
	
	
	Of the group, only Leina Uaongo was not intoxicated. She had consumed three mixed drinks of whiskey and cola between 10pm on 4 April and 2.30 the following morning. Her companions had all been drinking for longer and more heavily. The deceased, from whom a blood sample was later taken, had a blood alcohol reading of 0.174 grams per 100 mililitres, a reading which – to put it in some familiar context - is significantly above the high range prescribed concentration of alcohol. There was also present in his blood an amount of methylamphetamine of less than 0.05 miligrams per litre, and evidence of the consumption of both prescription medication and cannabis.
	
	
	The group of friends walked out of the back exit of the hotel and across to the park in which Ms. Orchard had been sitting, taking a small bridge that ran over a storm water drain to cross onto Wollombi Road. During that short walk Hayley Orchard was yelling abuse towards the group, but the deceased and his friends largely ignored her. They continued walking, crossing Allandale Road and walking a short distance along Wollombi Road.
	
	
	Located on the corner of Allandale and Wollombi Roads is the Cessnock Public Swimming Pool. The entrance to the pool complex is in Allandale Road; on the corner extending down Wollombi Road is a small car park for the use of pool visitors.
	
	
	As the friends reached the footpath on the corner Hayley Orchard and Melanie O’Neil came up behind them. Hayley Orchard was still yelling abusively, directing some of her comments to Connor Young. The offender was with Ms. Orchard.
	
	
	Connor Young made a comment back to Ms. Orchard, and the offender immediately responded, accusing Mr. Young of saying something to his “missus”. An argument developed between the two, with Mr. Young calling the offender a “fuckwit” and telling him to go home, whilst the offender yelled at Mr. Young, calling him “a little cunt” and challenging him to “have a go”.
	
	
	As the offender told Connor Young that he was going to “hit” and “get” Young, Hayley Orchard fed the flames, yelling “this little cunt is gunna get it” and like statements. Although Mr. Young had at first told the offender to “get over it”, he soon became agitated himself, and accepted the offender’s challenge, saying to him, “you want to do this, you want to go”. The offender’s response was “Let’s do this, let’s do this right now”.
	
	
	The men moved into the car park adjacent to the swimming pool. Each tore his shirt and cap off, and raised his fists. The offender shouted, “You want to go you little cunt, I’ll cave your head in”; Connor Young responded in similar vein. Hayley Orchard continued to yell aggressively, demanding of the offender, “Hit the putrid cunt, flog him. This cunt deserves everything he gets”.
	
	
	As the two protagonists paced around each other in a circular movement, the offender struck out at Connor Young, landing a blow to his face that knocked Mr. Young to the ground. Mr. Young got immediately to his feet and moved to hit the offender, but the offender managed to land another blow, again knocking Connor Young to the ground, at a location close to a pair of black metal gates leading into the pool grounds.
	
	
	Ms. Uaongo, who was standing close to the pair, saw the offender raise his leg in a motion that suggested he was about to kick Connor Young as he lay on his back on the ground. Seeing this, Ms. Uaongo immediately pushed the offender back against the gates and grasped him in what she described in her evidence as “like a bear hug”. The gates moved slightly inwards under the pressure of the movement of Ms. Uaongo and the offender.
	
	
	Ms. Uaongo managed to hold the offender for a couple of minutes, despite his constant attempts to break free from her grip, and despite being kicked by both the offender in front of her and Mr. Young on the ground behind her, as each man tried to kick the other. Ms. Uaongo let the offender go only when he dropped his mouth to her shoulder in an attempt to bite her.
	
	
	Charmaine Allen had come towards the three and taken hold of Ms. Uaongo in an attempt to pull her away from the fight. As Ms. Uaongo released her hold on the offender she saw him reach into his pants pocket and pull out something that she thought looked like a pocket knife. He flicked the implement in a fast moving downward motion, as if flicking a blade out.
	
	
	Ms. Uaongo recognised the implement as similar to a device she had once had when a cadet with the army. She described it as a device which had a number of tools in one, including a screwdriver and a knife.
	
	
	Ms. Uaongo stepped back as she saw the offender raise his arm, apparently to hit her. At that moment, to assist his friends Mr. Dehn moved quickly towards the group and moved to hit the offender. The offender was already in motion, with his arm swinging upwards in Ms. Uaongo’s direction. As the deceased struck out with his fist towards the offender, the offender completed the upward movement of his arm, striking Mr. Dehn, with the implement in his hand. The blade portion of the tool was extended, with the other tools enclosed in the offender’s hand. Ms. Uaongo saw the offender slash Mr. Dehn’s arm with the blade.
	
	
	She next saw Mr. Dehn hit the offender, and the offender hit Mr. Dehn for a second time.
	
	
	Although neither Ms. Uaongo nor any of the other people in the car park at this moment saw the blade in the offender’s hand as this second blow was struck, consistent with the verdict of the jury I have concluded that the offender in fact had the blade in his hand at this time. As he struck out at Mr. Dehn for a second time, his intention was to do him grievous bodily harm.
	
	
	It is likely that Mr. Dehn did not immediately notice that he had been stabbed by that blow. The fight continued for what may have been as much as a few minutes, with the younger Mr. Dehn quickly getting the better of the offender. As the pair moved away from the metal fence in the direction of a low wooden fence towards the rear of the car park, Mr. Dehn landed as many as twenty blows on the offender, eventually taking hold of him by the throat and forcing him back against the low fence.
	
	
	Connor Young was yelling to Mr. Dehn to stop, and he ran to him and grabbed his friend, preventing Mr. Dehn from striking the offender again. Mr. Dehn released the offender. The offender got up from the fence holding his throat. Mr. Dehn said, “I’ve got your back” to Connor Young.
	
	
	The offender got his telephone from his pocket and made a call. Ms. Uaongo heard him say “I want my boys down here now […] this is going down”. He then walked away towards the road telling Hayley Orchard “We’ll be back”. Ms. Orchard, still calling abuse to Connor Young, followed him.
	
	
	Jake Burrage was standing nearby berating Connor Young for starting a fight, telling him that the offender, whom he referred to by the nickname of “Cycle”, was related to him. Ms. Orchard walked towards Mr. Burrage and punched him in the face, abusing him as she struck him. She then hit him across the head with the liquor bottle from which she had been drinking. (Ms. Orchard was charged over this assault and later sentenced before the Local Court.)
	
	
	As Leina Uaongo moved towards Jake Burrage to see if he was alright, she heard Riley Dehn call out as if in pain. When she turned to look at him, she saw him holding each arm with the other hand, as if bracing his arms. He then ran off in the direction of the nearby police station. He was yelling “I need to get help, I need to get help”.
	
	
	The offender was moving in the opposite direction, calling back “You’re gunna get it” to Connor Young. Soon after, a car travelling along Wollombi Road pulled in to the kerb, and the offender and Hayley Orchard got into the car. The car drove around and came past Connor Young. Hayley Orchard screamed abuse at Connor Young, and then threw a bottle at him, which missed its target. The car drove away.
	
	
	Riley Dehn had run on towards the police station on Wollombi Road at Cessnock, obviously intending to get assistance there. Sadly, he collapsed just before reaching the police station, and sank to the footpath. A passing motorist stopped to help him, and a crowd quickly gathered. Melanie O’Neil ran to the police station for aid, and officers came to Mr. Dehn and commenced CPR on him. An ambulance was summonsed.
	
	
	All efforts to save Mr. Dehn were futile, and life was pronounced extinct at 3.23am on 5 April 2013.
	
	
	Later on 5 April 2013 Dr. Brian Beer of the Newcastle Department of Forensic Medicine conducted an autopsy on the body of Riley Dehn. Dr. Beer determined the cause of death to be a single stab wound to the central chest, at the level of the sternum, which was transected. The wound, which was between 70 – 80 millimetres long, had passed completely through the heart and caused significant bleeding in and around the heart and into the cavity surrounding the left lung.
	
	
	There was also a small superficial incised wound to the left side of the body, adjacent to the fatal wound. An incised wound was defined by Dr. Beer as one which is longer than it is deep. The doctor interpreted the two wounds to the knife having “gone in as a stab and come out as an incised wound”. He considered the heart wound as being consistent with one inflicted by a small pen knife or flick knife.
	
	
	Almost two litres of blood, that being about a third of the body’s blood, had flowed into the left pleural cavity and the pericardial cavity, and it was the wound to the heart coupled with the significant blood loss that led quickly to death.
	
	
	Dr. Beer additionally saw “through and through” wounds to the left forearm, midway between the wrist and the elbow. He regarded these injuries as consistent with the implement that caused the wounds entering the skin of the forearm on one side and coming out on the other side. The entrance wound was 36 - 39 x 11 millimetres, with the exit wound being 12 - 13 x 4 millimetres in size. Dr. Beer regarded these wounds as “classic defence type wounds”.
	
	
	Some minor facial abrasions were noted.
	
	
	The injuries observed at autopsy by Dr. Beer are consistent with having been inflicted by the offender using the blade of a multi-tool. The through and through wound to the left arm is the first of the injuries inflicted by the offender, in the upwards thrust Ms. Uaongo saw the offender make with the multi-tool blade in his hand. The second blow with the blade of the multi-tool was that which caused both the fatal chest wound and the incised wound. The facial lacerations are attributable to the fist blows to the face in the course of the fight that followed.
	
	
	Dr. Beer opined that a fit young man such as the deceased could sustain a wound of the nature inflicted upon Mr. Dehn, and keep moving for some considerable distance and period of time until, ultimately, so much blood had flowed into the pericardial sack that the heart could no longer pump, and it stopped.
	


Events After the Stabbing


	
	Having gotten into the car that stopped to pick him and Ms. Orchard up, the offender asked the driver to take him to Hunter Avenue at Cessnock. The offender must have picked up the shirt that he had torn off before the fight with Connor Young before leaving the swimming pool car park, but he abandoned it in Hunter Avenue, on the footpath a short distance from the block of units in which he was staying.
	
	
	The offender went to the unit, and awoke the occupants, Russell Payne and Carole Myles. The offender told Mr. Payne, “I stabbed someone”, and gave him the multi-tool, asking him to wash it. Mr. Payne did as he was asked and washed the blade, which was some seven or eight centimetres in length, in the kitchen sink. Soon after the offender told Mr. Payne to take the knife and get rid of it. Mr. Payne thereafter took the knife out of the unit and went to some garbage bins located in the unit block’s utility area. He dropped the tool into a garbage bin.
	
	
	On returning to the unit Mr. Payne told the offender he had put the knife in a bin. The offender told him that this was too close to the units, and directed him to go and get the knife, and take it further away from the unit block. Mr. Payne retrieved the knife and eventually disposed of it in a storm water drain adjacent to the showground at Cessnock.
	
	
	For what remained of that night and over the following day the offender evaded police.
	
	
	There followed a number of actions by the offender which were intended by him to interfere with evidence of his crime. At his behest, Kayla Houston recovered the multi-tool from the storm water drain and, with the apparent assistance of another friend of the offender, disposed of it in such a way that it has never been found.
	
	
	The offender additionally sought to have Melanie O’Neil, Russell Payne and Carole Myers dissuaded from giving evidence of their knowledge of the events, and endeavoured to have Kayla Houston make a false statement to the effect that the offender was unarmed when he left her home in the early hours of 5 April 2013.
	
	
	The offender himself gave the police a false account of events when he was interviewed on 6 April 2013, going so far as to imply that Hayley Orchard may have been responsible for Mr. Dehn’s death.
	
	
	Even during the course of his trial the offender made an apparent attempt to interfere with evidence to be given to the jury, taking the considerable risk of passing a letter to Kalya Houston in the courthouse cells, urging her to “say the right things” in her evidence so that the offender could “beat this trial”.
	
	
	The Crown relied on evidence of the offender’s attempts to interfere with the trial process as consciousness of guilt. It is of relevance in these proceedings only insofar as it is relevant to determining the facts of the offence for which the offender is to be sentenced, consistent with the jury’s verdict. Having regard to this evidence, the jury plainly rejected the offender’s version of events, as it was ultimately given by the plea entered by him on 30 March 2015. The jury doubtless had regard to the offender’s conduct and lies following the stabbing in rejecting the veracity of the version implicit in the plea to manslaughter.
	
	
	The offender’s conduct after the stabbing cannot, in the circumstances that apply here, make the gravity of the murder any greater. In that regard I have set the post-offence conduct entirely aside. The offender may well face charges over some aspects of his conduct, but there are no charges before this Court.
	


The Self-Defence Issue


	
	The offender’s case at trial was, as I apprehend it, that he acted as he did in self-defence. From 30 March 2015, his case was that he acted from a reasonable belief that he had to act in the way that he did to defend himself, although acknowledging that it was not a reasonable response to the situation as he perceived it to be.
	
	
	The offender did not give evidence before the jury, but a recording of his police interview was in evidence as Exhibit AD. In his interview the offender admitted having become involved in an altercation with “a big tall skinny fella” [Connor Young], an “Islander girl” [Ms. Uaongo] and a “few” others, who had, collectively, gotten “stuck into” him. He said that there had been a “wrestle”, after which he had walked away, saying “Mate, I don’t need the trouble”. He claimed to have no knowledge of how a young man had been stabbed that night.
	
	
	Later in the interview he expanded that account, referring to “another young fella” with whom he had had a “wrestle” in the vicinity of the low wooden fence, the young man having approached him when he was standing near the black gates with Ms. Uaongo. He continued to deny any knowledge of a stabbing, or of how such a thing could have occurred.
	
	
	The offender told the police that he did not own a Leatherman or similar tool, unless there was one in his tool box, and he specifically denied being armed with any kind of blade during this incident.
	
	
	The jury plainly rejected that version, as it had to in light of the offender’s plea to manslaughter entered on 30 March 2015.
	
	
	By its verdict, the jury also rejected the assertion inherent in the offender’s plea to manslaughter, that he acted from a belief that it was necessary to take action in his own defence, albeit excessive to what was required.
	
	
	The jury necessarily accepted the evidence of Leina Uaongo and that of other witnesses as to the circumstances in which Mr. Dehn was stabbed. That is, the jury must have accepted that the offender, having become angry at a perceived insult to Hayley Orchard, picked a fight with Connor Young, and assaulted him. At a point when Connor Young was on the ground, having been knocked down for the second time by a blow struck by the offender, and in a position to do no more than kick his legs out in the offender’s direction, the offender pulled the multi-tool from his pocket and, with a deliberate motion, flicked out the blade. He armed himself in this way even though Mr. Young posed no immediate threat to him, and despite Leina Uaongo having quite bravely placed herself between the offender and Mr. Young in an attempt to stop any further violence.
	
	
	Implicit in the jury’s verdict is the conclusion that the offender flicked out the knife at that point, when he was not under attack and had already bested Connor Young, intending to use it. When the deceased approached him, he swung the blade in an upwards motion, causing the wound to Mr. Dehn’s left forearm. He thereafter swung the knife towards Mr. Dehn’s torso and thrust it into his chest with considerable force, sufficient to penetrate bone and the heart muscle.
	
	
	The offender submits that the jury may have concluded that the fatal wound was inflicted later in the course of the altercation, when the offender was being punched repeatedly by Mr. Dehn but, had that been the jury’s conclusion, then it seems to me there must have been a verdict for manslaughter, on the basis of excessive self-defence.
	
	
	In my view, the partial defence of excessive self-defence was available to the offender later in the course of the altercation. It was not so available at the very early point, when Ms. Uaongo saw the offender produce the tool, flick open the blade, and use it to wound Mr. Dehn. For the facts to be consistent with the jury’s verdict, the fatal wound must have been inflicted at that point.
	
	
	Inherent in an act such as that in light of the whole of the evidence is an intention to cause grievous bodily harm to the deceased.
	
	
	Despite the wounds, Mr. Dehn then rapidly got the better of the offender, and there was no further use by the offender of the knife. The fatal blow had already been struck.
	


The Gravity of the Offence


	
	The gravity of the offence of murder, and the reason the legislature has specified a maximum penalty of life imprisonment for it, is in the taking of a human life.
	
	
	There could be no more moving and eloquent demonstration of why the offence of murder carries such a significant maximum penalty than the two victim impact statements received by the Court this morning. Debra Dehn, Riley’s mother, and his grandparents, Ronald and Delma Dehn, have shared with the Court their pain and loss, and the pain and loss of others who have been terribly affected by this crime, including Riley Dehn’s father and his young daughter.
	
	
	That loss, and that pain reflects the loss to the community as a whole of the life of one of its members. That Mr. Dehn was greatly loved, and that those who love him suffered and suffer still, does not make this murder more serious than any other; it is why all murders are viewed so seriously.
	
	
	Beyond that commonality of the loss of life, there are a wide range of circumstances in which the offence of murder may be committed.
	
	
	The task of this court is to determine where on the spectrum that is represented by the range of penalty culminating in life imprisonment this offender’s culpability falls. The assessment of culpability must be made according to the laws of sentencing that bind this Court. There is a complex interrelationship between the principles that govern sentencing, general and personal deterrence, punishment, retribution, the protection of the community and the rehabilitation of the offender. The purposes of these principles overlap and none can be considered in isolation from the others.
	
	
	It must be acknowledged at the outset that to those who loved Riley Dehn the process of assessing the gravity of the crime of his murder must seem both incomprehensible, and even offensive. For Mr. Dehn’s family and friends there could be no worse crime than the murder of their loved one, and yet the lawyers speak of a range, and the Court engages in the exercise of assessing the gravity of the offence.
	
	
	For Mr. Dehn’s family, the principles of sentencing that perhaps most represent their interests in these proceedings are those which seek to make the offender accountable for his crime, to punish him, and to visit retribution upon him. Those considerations are balanced by others however, some of which, such as the need to consider the offender’s rehabilitation, must seem entirely counter-intuitive to Mr. Dean’s loved ones. It is understandable that they might expect to see the depth of their loss, pain, and grief reflected in the sentence imposed. That is unlikely to occur simply because no sentence that this Court can impose could ever truly compensate them for that loss.
	
	
	Acknowledging that the process of assessing the objective gravity of the crime for which the offender is to be sentenced is likely to distress those present to represent their lost loved one, the Court endeavours in this assessment to inform the offender and the public, including Mr. Dehn’s family, of the reasons for the sentence to be imposed.
	
	
	This was a crime committed in the early hours of the morning in a public place when a number of people were in the vicinity.
	
	
	Whilst the Crown case as it was put to the jury included a contention that the offender had gone to the area of the Cessnock Hotel in an angry mood and looking for a fight because of disparaging comments supposedly made by security guards about him and conveyed to him by Hayley Orchard, I cannot draw that conclusion beyond reasonable doubt.
	
	
	It is at least as likely that the offender went to the area of the Hotel for no reason other than to collect Hayley Orchard. It would have represented no great detour in his journey from Aberdare to Hunter Avenue Cessnock to do so and, since Ms. Orchard had repeatedly asked him to collect her, and the offender had not been able to persuade her brother to undertake that role, he may have gone to the location simply to take her home.
	
	
	Ms. Uaongo was clearly in error in identifying the offender as the man with a stick, at the point at which she first saw him, and so I cannot conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that it was the offender whom she was referring to when she described the man with the stick as seemingly angry, agitated, and pacing about before the dispute broke out.
	
	
	After arriving there, however, the offender quickly became angry because of comments that he understood Connor Young to have directed to Ms. Orchard. He involved himself in the aggression of his then partner to the extent of challenging Mr. Young to fight. His willingness to engage in violence in a public street when people were milling about sets the scene for what followed.
	
	
	The offender was armed, but in the circumstances of this case I do not think that his possession of a blade prior to the point at which he withdrew it from his pocket increases the gravity of his crime. A multi-tool is an implement carried by many people for legitimate purposes, and the mere possession of an implement of this nature cannot establish that the offender was going about the streets armed in the way that phrase is ordinarily applied in the criminal law. A multi-tool can be used as a weapon, but equally it can be used for many wholly legitimate purposes. Carrying a multi-tool is not an offence, unlike the act of carrying a cutting implement.
	
	
	Mr. Payne gave evidence that the offender generally carried a Leatherman tool in a brown case that was ordinarily looped onto his belt. Given that the offender was described as someone who frequently rode a pushbike, carrying a tool of this type on his person could be readily attributable to the sort of running repairs cyclists on occasion have to make. I cannot conclude that he carried it for nefarious purposes.
	
	
	The fact that the offender was willing to quickly resort to the use of a knife blade on the tool is, however, a feature which heightens the criminality of this offence in my view. The appellant introduced a weapon into what had been a fist fight, and he showed a ready willingness to use the weapon with lethal force against an unarmed man.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the Court should not have regard to the use of a knife as an aggravating feature pursuant to s.21A(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. Mr. Flynn for the offender made the same submission, but additionally submitted that the use of the knife did not make this particular offence of murder more serious, and the Court was not entitled to have regard to it.
	
	
	Whilst I accept the former submission, I do not agree with the latter submission. Although I do agree that the use of a weapon per se does not necessarily make a murder any worse in terms of its factual seriousness, it seems to me that that is a question to be determined on the facts of an individual case.
	
	
	Here, a knife was introduced into a fist fight, and the offender’s readiness to introduce a weapon does heighten the offender’s moral culpability to a degree in my view. The use of the knife was the means of committing the murder, and to that extent, it cannot make the offence any more serious, but it can and does evidence a readiness to resort to a weapon to solve a grievance that has some relevance to the offender’s moral culpability.
	
	
	The offence was committed spontaneously, with no forethought or planning.
	
	
	Mr. Flynn submitted that this feature of the matter alone must place it below the mid-range of seriousness, but I am aware of no authority to that effect, and do not accept that that is the law. That an offence was committed without any forethought is simply one of the features to be taken into account in assessing the gravity of the offence. Certainly, it is a feature that can indicate that a particular crime may well fall below a notional mid-point, but it is necessary to consider all relevant features before reaching that conclusion.
	
	
	Having spontaneously engaged in a fist fight, the offender was angry and, probably equally spontaneously, he drew out the multi-tool with the intention of producing the blade. He flicked it open immediately, intending to use it, probably upon Connor Young or Leina Uaongo, although I cannot be satisfied of that beyond a reasonable doubt. When Mr. Dehn approached him the offender immediately struck out at him, with the knife in his hand. Having caused the wound to the deceased’s arm, the offender struck a second, forceful blow, towards Mr. Dehn’s torso.
	
	
	The second blow was struck with the intention of causing grievous bodily harm to Mr. Dehn. Whilst a murder committed with the intention of inflicting really serious bodily harm can place the crime within the middle of any notional range of objective gravity, the assessment in this regard also, must be made in light of all the relevant surrounding circumstances.
	
	
	Mr. Flynn submitted that the gravity of the crime was diminished by at least an element of self-defence, albeit not sufficient to constitute a defence or partial defence. However, at the point at which the fatal blow must have been struck, the offender was on the offensive. Self defence cannot, therefore, have a mitigating role in terms of culpability.
	
	
	The offender willingly engaged in a fist fight in a public street where a number of people were present. He quickly resorted to the use of a weapon, which he introduced into a fist fight, and used without hesitation against an unarmed man. He struck two blows towards the deceased, the second of which was propelled by sufficient force to cut through bone, and the heart, a major muscle.
	
	
	Although he was well aware that he had stabbed Mr. Dehn, since he said so soon after to Mr. Payne, the offender did nothing to render aid to Mr. Dehn, or even to check on his condition. Instead, he left the scene, shouting that he would be back. Mr. Flynn contends that there was some threat to the offender and so he may have felt that he could not stop and render aid to Mr. Dehn. That may be so, but the offender had a mobile telephone, and it would have been open to him to telephone an ambulance, even if he did so anonymously and having left the scene. He took no such action.
	
	
	The maximum penalty for any offence is reserved for the worst example of that offence. That is, one that is so objectively heinous that matters personal to the offender leave little or no scope for any amelioration of the penalty to be imposed. This offence does not fall within that category. Necessarily, the penalty will be lower than the maximum available.
	
	
	The Crown has submitted that this offence is one which is at the middle of the range of objective seriousness for an offence of murder. The offender submits that his crime falls below that point.
	
	
	It is not necessary to express a conclusion as to the objective gravity of the offence by reference to a range. Insofar as language of that nature may make the conclusions of the Court clear however, in my view this matter falls at or very slightly below the mid-point of objective gravity.
	
	
	In making that assessment, the court acknowledges that it may well do nothing to address the pain Mr. Dehn’s family and friends have suffered, not just by the death of their loved one, but also through being subjected to what can be the distressing processes of the criminal justice system itself.
	
	
	Mr Dehn’s mother Debra referred in her victim impact statement to the pain of being instantly caught up in that process, even when seeing her son for the last time. She was prevented from holding her child, because his body was said to be evidence. The shock and grief at such an experience must have been overwhelming.
	
	
	Since being informed of the death of a son, grandson, father, and loved one, they have found themselves in an unfamiliar environment that may appear to discount them almost entirely. They have had to deal with their grief from within that environment. The giving of a victim impact statement is some opportunity to tell the Court how Riley Dehn’s death has affected them all.
	
	
	As I said a short time ago, the depth of the pain felt by Riley Dehn’s family and friends is demonstrative of his loss to the community, the significance of that loss being the reason why murder is viewed as our community’s most serious crime. Here, a young man of 21, father to an infant girl, a son, grandson, and friend, has been taken away from his family and the community.
	
	
	This Court must sentence the offender according to law, acting impartially, with objectivity and by the rigorous application of legal principle. However, no-one could fail to be moved by Ms. Dehn’s expression of the impact that this offence has had on the Dehn family, or in hearing of the pain of Mr. and Mrs. Dehn’s loss, and that of their grandson’s father.
	


The Offender’s Personal Circumstances


	
	The offender was born on 13 July 1971 and was 41 years old at the time of the offence. He is now 43 years of age.
	
	
	Mr. Scott has a lengthy criminal history which commenced in October 1987 when he first appeared at Cessnock Children’s Court. He was then aged 16 years. He has been consistently before the courts from that time until this.
	
	
	By far the majority of the offender’s criminal history relates to offences of violence or intimidation. On my calculation from sentence Ex. A, the offender has 22 entries against him for contravening an apprehended domestic violence order (ADVO), such offences often involving violence or the threat of it; 26 entries for assault; thee for assault occasioning actual bodily harm; five for intimidation, and one for intimidation of a police officer; three entries for assaulting police officers in the execution of their duty; and 10 for resisting police in the same circumstances; and one for Aggravated Break Enter and Steal, where the elderly home occupier was assaulted with a weapon.
	
	
	Eight of the offender’s crimes involved the use of a weapon and, on five of those occasions, the weapon was a knife.
	
	
	His record is such as to disentitle him to a measure of leniency that might otherwise have been extended to him.
	
	
	Over the years a range of sentencing options have been utilised by the courts, and there are a number of sentences which have required the offender to participate in rehabilitative programmes, including programmes addressing drug and alcohol use, and those seeking to address his obvious problem with anger management and the use of violence to solve difficulties with others.
	
	
	The offender has been sentenced to imprisonment on more than 25 separate occasions and has seen parole revoked on a number of occasions.
	
	
	That was the case for parole with respect to the offence of aggravated break enter steal from July 1999 where the offender, in company with another, used an implement to inflict injury upon an elderly man, in the course of taking property from that man’s house.
	
	
	Before the Court as part of Ex. B are two documents from the sentence proceedings relevant to that offence. Although each dates from 1999, and the passage of time diminishes their weight to a degree, they do provide some evidence of the depth to which the offender’s problem with violence is ingrained in him.
	
	
	He has continued to behave violently in prison with his custodial history showing many breaches for violent incidents. In the period March 1995 to April 2015, there are something like eight entries for fighting, two for assault, and others for intimidation, abusive behaviour and the like. In September last year, whilst awaiting trial for this matter, the offender was breached for fighting or other combat. Just last month there was a breach for damaging property.
	
	
	Those most recent entries can do nothing to demonstrate any positive basis for finding that there are reasonable prospects for rehabilitation.
	
	
	It is that pattern of violence over many years that has culminated in this offence.
	
	
	Despite the many opportunities the offender has had to rehabilitate himself with the assistance of the parole authorities, he has not taken advantage of them. A report tendered on his behalf today, Ex 1, suggests that the offender has completed rehabilitative courses in custody but, if so, they do not appear to have aided him in breaking free from a recidivist lifestyle. Of course, in circumstances where the offender has given no evidence, untested assertions to another must be treated with a degree of circumspection.
	
	
	The offender has a long standing issue with alcohol abuse, having taken up alcohol use at the age of 13.
	
	
	The offender had a somewhat fractured upbringing, with his parents separating when he was an infant, and he thereafter being raised by his father, grandmother and, later, aunt. The deaths of his aunt and grandmother have been the cause of longstanding grief with the offender telling Dr. Adams that his mood deteriorated following the death of his paternal aunt when he was 12, and his paternal grandmother at the age of 16.
	
	
	Ordinarily, the offender has told Dr. Adams, his mood is “pretty good” and that his emotional state is reasonably stable. He did concede that he had difficulty controlling anger when someone provokes him. He acknowledged his history of engaging in violence. He did not, however, acknowledge engaging in any aggression without some provocation or, at least what he perceived as provocation.
	
	
	The offender told Dr. Adams that his father was an alcoholic who physically abused him until, at 13 years, he began to fight back.
	
	
	He has children, who are now young adults.
	
	
	There is nothing in the report from Dr. Adams, the only evidence in the offender’s case, that establishes that the offender is remorseful for anything other than his own situation. Despite the offender’s plea to manslaughter entered on 30 March this year the offender told Dr. Adams “if I did it it was self defence.” One can take nothing of remorse from that comment.
	
	
	The offender has told Dr. Adams, and the doctor appears to agree, that his current mental health is reasonable.
	
	
	The subjective case for the offender is indeed slight. There is no evidence of any mental health condition which has relevance to either the commission of the offence or to his future prospects and conditions of custody.
	
	
	There is no basis upon which to make any positive assessment of the offender’s prospect of rehabilitation. While such an assessment involves making a prediction of conduct years hence, all of the evidence before the Court would suggest that the offender, having done little to address his offending conduct in the past, may follow a similar pattern. I can make no finding either way with respect to his prospects of rehabilitation.
	
	
	Mr. Flynn submits that the penalty to be imposed upon the offender should be ameliorated to reflect the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty to manslaughter but it was entered at a very late stage, after the most significant evidence had been called, and it seems to me that any utilitarian benefit was negligible. In those circumstances I do not propose to award any discount.
	
	
	Neither the Crown nor Mr. Flynn submit that there is any basis upon which to find that special circumstances exist and that is a sensible approach. There will in any event be a significant period of parole in this case by the simple operation of the ordinary statutory ratio of sentence. Such a period should be sufficient to give Mr Scott such assistance as he requires. Whether he accepts and utilises the advantages that that assistance will give him, will be entirely a matter for him.
	
	
	Section 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 sets out the purposes for which a Court may impose sentence on an offender. They are:
	


(a) to ensure that the offender is adequately punished for the offence,

(b) to prevent crime by deterring the offender and other persons from committing similar offences,

(c) to protect the community from the offender,

(d) to promote the rehabilitation of the offender,

(e) to make the offender accountable for his or her actions,

(f) to denounce the conduct of the offender,

(g) to recognise the harm done to the victim of the crime and the community.


	
	I have had regard to each of those purposes, multiple as they are, and in some regards pulling in opposite directions, in fixing the penalty to be imposed on the offender.
	


Sentence


	
	The offender, Michael Vincent Scott, is convicted.
	
	
	He is sentenced to a term of imprisonment comprising a non parole period of 18 years which is to date from 6 April 2013 and expire on 5 April 2031. There is an overall term of imprisonment of 24 years which will expire on 5 April 2037. The offender will be eligible for release to supervised parole upon the expiration of the non parole period on 5 April 2031.

	Her Honour Judge Huggett sentenced the applicant on 7 June 2013 to a total term of imprisonment for 10 years with a non-parole period of 6 years.
	
	
	The sole ground of appeal against conviction is that the judge erred in permitting the jury to use the applicant’s evidence as being evidence of consciousness of guilt if it concluded that his evidence was false, even though such a conclusion would invariably mean the prosecution had proven its case.
	
	
	There is also an application for leave to appeal against sentence (to which I shall return).
	


Overview of the case


	
	The Crown case was that the applicant caused 27 fraudulent business activity statements (“BASs”) to be lodged with the Australian Taxation Office (""ATO"") for two companies he controlled: Allrange.com Pty Limited (""Allrange"") and Sparktec Pty Limited (""Sparktec""). This occurred between December 2004 and June 2007. Each BAS falsely claimed a Goods and Services Tax (""GST"") refund by including falsely inflated figures for non-capital purchases and export sales income.
	
	
	The BASs were prepared by the applicant’s tax agent, Ms Candy Cheung. She simply accepted the accuracy of information on spread sheets the applicant provided her; it was not suggested that she was aware of any falsity.
	
	
	The applicant arranged for an employee, Ms Tina Cheung, to make a number of withdrawals from and deposits to the company bank accounts in an endeavour to create entries that he could claim related to the non-existent purchases and sales. Cheques payable to cash were deposited into the account from which the cheques were drawn. The resulting debits and credits in the bank statements were then used to support figures provided to Ms Candy Cheung for preparation of the monthly BASs.
	
	
	The ATO paid refunds on 22 out of the 23 BASs filed for Allrange and on 1 out of the 4 filed for Sparktec.
	
	
	$1,785,833.10 was the total amount of refunds paid by the ATO out of which $1,396,285.76 was fraudulently obtained.
	
	
	Refunds were not paid in relation to four BASs due to audit intervention by the ATO but the fraudulent component claimed in these totalled $163,544.45.
	
	
	The applicant claimed that the figures for non-capital purchases included the cost of Allrange and Sparktec having purchased mobile phones mostly (that is, except for May 2005) from BJ Multilink Investments Pty Limited (""BJ Multilink""). It was the Crown case that such purchases had never occurred. In fact, the Crown contended that BJ Multilink never even traded with Allrange or Sparktec.
	
	
	The applicant also claimed that phones purchased from BJ Multilink were exported, whereas the Crown case was that such exports could not have occurred without the phones having been purchased in the first place.
	
	
	On the Crown case, the applicant provided false invoices and other documents in the name of BJ Multilink during an ATO audit in an endeavour to show that the purchases had in fact been made. During a later investigation by the Australian Federal Police (""AFP""), material was found which established that the applicant had created the invoices and other documents himself. He admitted this, and said that this was necessary because emails he had received which had attached the original documents had been stored by him on a USB storage device which he had subsequently lost.
	
	
	At a later stage of the ATO audit, questions were raised about the multiple withdrawals from and deposits to the companies' bank accounts. From this point, the applicant advanced a complex explanation involving a need to create some form of record of purchases and sales because of a peculiar arrangement between his supplier, BJ Multilink, and his customers in Hong Kong. It was to the effect that BJ Multilink owed money to the Hong Kong customers so he was not required to pay BJ Multilink for the phones it supplied and he exported. The Hong Kong suppliers simply deducted amounts equivalent to what they would have paid the applicant's company from the debt owed to them by BJ Multilink. All the applicant had to do was to pay to BJ Multilink the GST component of the purchase price of the phones. Thus, he made the withdrawals and deposits to his company's bank account so that there would be a record of the value of the purchases and sales. He claimed that there was a differential between the withdrawal amounts and the deposit amounts and this represented the GST component that he was required to pay to BJ Multilink.
	


The investigation


	
	In June 2005 the ATO conducted a compliance review in relation to the May 2005 BAS lodged by Allrange (count 8). The applicant was asked to provide various documents to verify the claim for a refund. Included in what was provided was a purported invoice from Easycom Pty Limited (“Easycom”) to Allrange in relation to the sale of 155 mobile phones for $62,000. This was handwritten on a pro forma invoice document numbered 54 and dated 5 May 2005 which contained a notation that it was paid by Allrange by a particular cheque on 4 May 2005. This compliance review was carried out in a relatively perfunctory fashion and resulted in the May 2005 BAS being accepted and a refund paid.
	
	
	It was later determined during an investigation by the AFP that the applicant was the sole director of Easycom. During a later search of his office, a Spicers Olympic Brand Tax Invoice/Statement Book was found. It contained 100 numbered pages and invoice number 54 was the only page which had been used; all of the others were blank. The Crown thus contended that the applicant had fabricated this purported invoice from Easycom and that there was no such transaction involving a sale to Allrange of $62,000 worth of mobile phones.
	
	
	On 4 September 2006 the ATO commenced a more wide-ranging audit of the Allrange BASs for July 2004 to August 2006. The applicant provided invoices purportedly issued by BJ Multilink to Allrange to substantiate the expenses claimed as non-capital purchases in the BASs from October 2004 to August 2006, except for May 2005. Many of these invoices included notations of the number of Allrange cheques that the applicant claimed had been used to pay the invoiced amounts. Bank statements were also provided to further substantiate the non-capital purchase expense claims and export invoices were provided to substantiate export sales figures.
	
	
	Evidence from Westpac and the applicant’s former employee, Ms Tina Cheung, established that in nearly all cases the cheques referred to on the BJ Multilink invoices were payable to cash and had been deposited back into the Allrange account on which the cheques were drawn. However, the deposits were listed in the spread sheets the applicant provided to his tax agent, Ms Candy Cheung, as “Oversea” and they were included in the figure at item G2 on the BASs for export sales. The withdrawals were listed on the spread sheets as “stock oversea” and came to be part of the figure at item G11 on the BASs for non-capital purchases.
	
	
	Files found on secure data cards (""SD cards"") seized at the applicant’s home showed that in many cases the applicant had prepared the BJ Multilink invoices shortly before they were provided to the ATO.
	
	
	Also found on the SD cards were twin export invoices the applicant had prepared. One was called “Real” or “Cash” whilst the other was called “Cargo” or “Air Cargo”. Those called “Real” or “Cash” were for significantly lesser amounts than the corresponding invoice called “Cargo” or “Air Cargo”. The “Real” or “Cash” invoices could be reconciled to telegraphic transfers in the bank statements. Those called “Cargo” or “Air Cargo” in the higher amount which could not be reconciled in the bank statements were the ones that had been presented to the ATO.
	


BJ Multilink never traded with Allrange or Sparktec


	
	In 2004, Mr Shi (“Michael”) Gu wanted to start a business retailing mobile phones. He acquired an existing company (because it was cheaper than incorporating from scratch) from a friend, Jian Ting Zhu. The company was called BJ Multilink Investments Pty Limited. Documentation before the jury (Exhibit 46) showed that from 24 August 2004 Mr Gu became the sole director and company secretary. Mr Yu Che (“David”) Ou became a director from 10 August 2005 until he resigned on 7 June 2006.
	
	
	BJ Multilink registered the trading name New Sky Communications through which it operated a mobile phone retail store in Ashfield. The store dealt with individual consumers. Its weekly trade involved sales of 10 to 20 phones. It was not profitable. It never traded in large quantities of phones. The company’s bank account was opened on 1 September 2004 and closed on 29 June 2006. The bank statements were in evidence (Exhibit 44) and confirmed the company’s very modest financial standing. Mr Gu’s evidence was to the effect that BJ Multilink (trading as New Sky Communications) went out of business in 2006 because of an inability to pay its debts.
	
	
	Mr Gu was shown invoices that had been provided by the applicant to the ATO which purported to be from BJ Multilink. He confirmed they were fraudulent and that his company had never traded with Allrange (nor with Easycom, Smartphone Pty Limited (“Smartphone”) or Sparktec). Mr Ou’s evidence was to the same effect.
	
	
	There was also evidence that the three main suppliers to BJ Multilink supplied only modest quantities of phones to it; nothing like the quantity that would have been necessary for BJ Multilink to supply Allrange or Sparktec with what appeared in the invoices provided by the applicant to the ATO.
	


Tak Yu (James) Chan


	
	The purported “BJ Multilink” invoices found on the SD cards seized at the applicant’s home were all created after 13 October 2006 (the ATO audit having commenced a few weeks before). Tak Yu (“James”) Chan became the director of BJ Multilink from 13 October 2006.
	
	
	Ms Gina Bradley was assigned the task of carrying out the GST audit of Allrange on 4 September 2006. In mid-November that year she attempted to make contact with somebody at BJ Multilink and she ended up speaking to James Chan, the then director. She spoke with him by phone on a number of occasions between 15 November and 20 December 2006. She told him that she needed to verify invoices relating to sales to Sparktec, Smartphone and Easycom. He told her that he had made many sales to many entities on many occasions including to Julian Chen (Easycom, Smartphone, Allrange and Sparktec).
	
	
	James Chan told Ms Bradley that he had worked for BJ Multilink for about a year before the owners decided they no longer wanted the business and offered it to him. He got the job because the former owners were his friends and he worked as a delivery driver at first but slowly got more involved in the business. Ms Bradley told him that she had invoices worth over $14 million for supplies of mobile phones to Allrange and he said he had supplied those invoices; he had to create them again based on paper based records of funds received.
	
	
	James Chan explained to Ms Bradley that BJ Multilink would source phones and then ring clients to see if they wished to purchase them. It did not hold any stock; phones were traded immediately. He told her that Allrange paid for the phones in cash which it was taken straight to the supplier.
	
	
	Ms Bradley asked who he had purchased $14 million worth of phones from and he nominated only one supplier, Home Zone PL. He could not name any others. All suppliers were paid in cash.
	
	
	Despite repeated attempts between January and March 2007 Ms Bradley was unable to contact Mr Chan after her last conversation on 20 December 2006.
	
	
	It was suggested to Mr Gu in cross-examination (T176 – AB4) that a man named James Chan or Tak Yu Chan took over BJ Multilink on 23 October 2006. Mr Gu said that he had a recollection of a young man by the name of Chan having done so; he met him at the accountant’s office when the paperwork was signed. But Mr Gu said that this man had not worked previously for the company.
	
	
	Federal government records showed that James Chan was born in Hong Kong in 1984 and was in Australia in the following periods:
	


29 January 2004 to 12 October 2005 (age 19-20; occupation on incoming and outgoing passenger cards: “student”)

11 June 2006 to 13 December 2006 (age 22; occupation: “student”)

6 March 2007 to 11 April 2007 (under the alias Hugo Wong; age 22-23; occupation: “student”)

31 December 2010 to 28 February 2011 (as Hugo Wong; age 26; occupation: “sales”)

12 June 2011 to 29 August 2011 (as Hugo Wong; age 27; occupation: “sales”. No record of any subsequent return)


	
	The jury would have been well-entitled to reject what Tak Yu (James) Chan told Ms Bradley as lies, particularly having regard to (a) the evidence of Mr Gu and his suppliers about the modest business affairs of BJ Multilink; (b) Mr Gu's evidence refuting the claim that Chan worked for the company prior to when he took it over in October 2006; and (c) the immigration records that showed that Chan was in the country for only 4 of the 12 months prior to October 2006 when he claimed to have worked for BJ Multilink.
	


A Notice of Amended Assessment issued


	
	In April and May 2007 the applicant made a number of representations to the ATO to conclude the audit and to release refunds that he claimed were due and payable to him. He complained of experiencing cash flow problems as a result of the delay.
	
	
	On 26 June 2007 the ATO wrote to the applicant to give notice of an amended assessment in respect of the period 1 July 2004 to 30 September 2006. Whereas previously Allrange had been assessed as entitled to GST refunds totalling $1,801,564, it was now considered that the company was only in fact entitled to refunds totalling $330,367, the difference of $1,471,197 being now payable to the ATO. The applicant's response, through his accountant, was to inquire about an appeal process.
	


The ATO queries the deposit and withdrawal activity in the Allrange bank account


	
	On 30 August 2007 the ATO wrote to the applicant about the movements of cash and cheques in the Allrange bank account finding it had been done ""to create an appearance of inflated export trade by creating fictitious transactions to support [the applicant’s] claims made for refund via BAS"". It continued, ""Our findings in respect of this issue resulted in a $1,468,488 GST shortfall"". It quoted the following example (omitting irrelevant entries):

	By way of response to this letter, in October 2007 the applicant, through Ms Candy Cheung, provided the ATO with copies of contracts he had with Hong Kong customers. For example, there was a purported ""Contract for Sale of Goods"" between Allrange Pty Ltd and Dynamic Tech Development. It commenced with a statement that it was an ""agreement made and entered into this 2nd January 2006"" and concluded with a statement that ""this agreement has been executed in duplicate, whereby both buyer and seller have retained one copy each, on 20th August 2007"". It included the following:
	


""Buyer has nominated that the source of the stock be given by BJ Multilink as an act of repayment of outstanding balance from their account.

The Buyer will then be responsible to compensate the account balance for BJ Multilink account and to notify the Seller when the deal terminates."" (AB2 408)


	
	A purported ""Contract for Sale of Goods"" between Allrange and Gammacomm Technology Ltd was in identical terms.
	
	
	Invoices purportedly issued by BJ Multilink to Allrange were also provided but they included endorsements of which one appearing on an invoice dated 14 September 2005 was typical:
	


""For this invoice we use stock to OFFSET the outstanding amount plus the GST. We only get the GST from Allrange. We got the balance from our oversea client.""


	
	This was the first time the ATO had been informed of a purported offset arrangement involving BJ Multilink.
	
	
	The evidence of Mr Michael Gu included that BJ Multilink never had any dealings with any businesses in Hong Kong; particularly with Dynamic Tech Development, Gammacomm Technology Limited, or Klenebon Limited. Ms Belinda Dudzaiak, an officer with the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service, gave evidence that she conducted a search and found that there was no record of BJ Multilink importing or exporting anything in the period October 2004 to April 2007.
	
	
	The last allegedly fraudulent BAS for Allrange was lodged in respect of August 2006. (The ATO audit commenced in September 2006.) Four such BASs for Sparktec were lodged from that time up to April 2007. They were also subject to auditing and police investigation. The applicant's methodology and explanation was along the same lines as it was in respect of Allrange.
	
	
	When the applicant's residence was searched by police on 26 February 2008 a notebook was found and seized. It contained three pages of handwritten notes which the Crown asserted comprised a rehearsal of explanations and excuses that would be, or were, given to the ATO. (Exhibit 51)
	


Ground of appeal against conviction


	
	As indicated earlier, there is only one ground of appeal against conviction:
	


“Her Honour erred in permitting the jury to use the applicant’s evidence as being evidence of consciousness of guilt if it concluded that his evidence was false, even though such a conclusion would invariably mean the prosecution had proved its case.”


	
	Counsel for the applicant acknowledged that leave pursuant to r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules was required because the point had not been taken at the trial. The point is not without merit and I consider that leave should be granted.
	


The direction


	
	The learned trial judge gave a direction about using lies as evidence of consciousness of guilt in conventional terms (in accordance with Edwards v The Queen [1993] HCA 63; 178 CLR 193) and it is not suggested that there was any legal error in that respect. The ground is concerned with whether a direction should have been given at all in relation to some of the asserted lies.
	
	
	The applicant admitted in his evidence that he had told lies to his accountant, Ms Candy Cheung, and to the ATO auditor, Ms Gina Bradley. Those lies were to the effect that deposits and withdrawals in the bank accounts of Allrange and Sparktec represented payments to suppliers and receipts from customers. He explained in his evidence that they were in fact simply transactions that were made in order that there would be a record of invoices for phones supplied to overseas third parties. He needed such a record because of the offset arrangement whereby he did not need to pay BJ Multilink anything for the phones except for the GST component and in return, he would not receive payment from the overseas third parties who instead would reduce the debt that BJ Multilink owed to them.
	
	
	The applicant takes no issue with those lies being the subject of a consciousness of guilt direction. Her Honour dealt with them in one portion of her summing up (SU 19-21) before immediately proceeding to the impugned direction (SU 21-25):
	


“The Crown further asserts that the accused told lies in court in his evidence. The accused stated in his evidence that the real reason for the grouped or structured transactions in each relevant company account was because these transactions, the withdraw, deposit, withdraw, deposit, withdraw, deposit and so forth transactions, that [sic] represented his method of recording offset transactions. The accused told you that in any given month, and I think the structured transactions commenced about count 6, prior to count 6 they are individual transactions, as reflected in exhibit 108, the Crown says that even though they were not structured or grouped in counts 1 to 5, they were fabrications. They were not really for the purchase of phones for export overseas and therefore they are included by the Crown in counts 1 to 5.

The accused said that the structured or grouped transaction system commenced to enable him to record the total amount of the invoices for phones supplied in a particular month by BJ Multilink to overseas third parties via the accused’s companies, purportedly because James Chan owed overseas entities approximately $15 million in unrelated debt. The accused said in his evidence that these grouped or structured transactions would provide him with a surplus because the withdrawals exceeded the deposits, and that the surplus represented the GST component that Allrange or Sparktec had to pay BJ Multilink locally because BJ’s stock had been locally supplied to those companies and therefore it was liable to pay the GST component.

In cross-examination the Crown put to the accused that this explanation for the structured transactions as being a method of recording transactions was fictitious, made up, and further that if one does the sums, on occasions the surplus was vastly inadequate to meet the GST component owing on a particular transaction. To that the accused replied that the offset arrangement was such that when the surplus was inadequate to meet the GST due on a particular transaction, the overseas buyer would factor that shortfall in and would then deduct the shortfall from the debt BJ Multilink or James Chan purportedly owed to the overseas supplier. The accused also said that from time to time he would borrow money from James Chan to purchase stock.

The Crown submits that you would find that the accused’s evidence is all lies, is just made up. The Crown submits that if these structured transactions occurred in fact to record the total value of the invoices, the surplus should equal the GST which on occasions it did not. The Crown also submits that the accused is lying when he says that the overseas companies would make up the difference or offset the difference and then he would borrow money from James Chan. The Crown submits that you would find the accused lied in Court when he told you that the BJ Multilink Investment invoices were genuine and reflected real commercial transactions.

Additionally, the Crown submits that the accused lied when he contended that there was a complex offset arrangement involving the accused’s companies, BJ Multilink or James Chan and overseas buyers.

This leads to a direction that I am required to give you regarding lies. At law, a lie is to say something which is untrue, knowing that at the time that it is said it is untrue. If a person says something one day which is untrue but does not realise at the time of saying it that it was untrue, then it is not a lie. The person could have been mistaken or confused. To be a lie the person must say something that the person knows at the time of making the statement is untrue.

If you find that what the accused said in Court regarding the transactions in exhibit 108 being genuine transactions with BJ Multilink Investments and that what he said regarding any offset arrangement were lies because at the time he said those things he knew that what he was saying was untrue, then I must give you a direction about the care with which you must approach your task of deciding what significance this has.

You may take a lie into account as evidence of the accused’s guilt, but you can only do that if you find proved two further things, which I will come to in a minute. Should you find that the accused told a lie [or] lies, when I say that you can take that into account as evidence of the accused’s guilt, I am not suggesting that a lie or lies alone could prove the accused’s guilt. What I mean is that it can be considered along with all of the other facts the Crown relies upon and which you find established on the evidence, in considering whether the Crown has proved its case beyond reasonable doubt.

So before you can use a lie as some evidence of the accused’s guilt you must find matters proved. Firstly, you must find that what the accused said was deliberate and that it relates to a significant or material circumstance or event connected with the alleged offences.

The Crown asserts that the connection or the involvement of BJ Multilink Investments is significant or material because that connection underpins the reason the accused gave for the offset arrangement. If there is no debt by James Chan, there is no need for an offset. The Crown submits that what the accused has said in court and outside of court regarding his involvement with BJ Multilink is very significant because the Crown case is that the BJ Multilink invoices, as represented in exhibit 108, are all fictitious.

Secondly, you must find that the reason the accused told the lie, or lies, was because he feared that telling the truth might reveal his guilt in respect of the charges he now faces. In other words that he feared that telling the truth would implicate him in the commission of the offences for which he is now on trial. You must remember that people do not always act rationally, and that conduct of this sort, that is telling a lie, may sometimes be explained in other reasons apart from trying to conceal one’s guilt. A person may tell a lie out of panic, a person may tell a lie to protect some other person, or to protect some other interest that they have. A person may tell a lie to escape an unjust accusation, or to avoid some consequence totally unrelated to the offence.

In this regard the accused has provided an explanation for his out of court lies, that is the lies that he now agrees he said to Gina Bradley and Candy Cheung. He said the reason he told these lies was because he was concerned that these persons would not be able to understand or comprehend the third part offset arrangement. But the accused asserts that what he said in court regarding the offset arrangement and his dealings with BJ Multilink is the truth.

If you think that the accused may have told a lie, or lies, for some reason other than to avoid being implicated in the commission of the offences for which he is now on trial then you cannot use the lie as evidence of the accused’s guilt. In that case you must put it to one side and focus your deliberations on the other evidence. So to repeat, you can only use it, lie, or lies, as being some evidence of the accused’s guilt, if you find that it was deliberate and that it relates to some significant, or material event or circumstance connected with the alleged offences.

Secondly, you must find that the reason the accused told the lie or lies was not because of panic or fear or worry about protecting other persons, but because telling the truth might reveal his guilt in respect of the charges that he now faces.” (Emphasis added.)

Submissions for the applicant


	
	The trial judge identified for the jury “the real issue” in the trial as being whether the accused was being deceptive or dishonest by purporting to claim that his companies had the various transactions with BJ Multilink. She said:
	


“The real issue, you might think, is whether or not the accused in having the business activity forms submitted, was being deceptive or dishonest by purporting to claim that his consequence [sic] had these transactions with BJ Multilink, transactions that the Crown says had not in fact occurred. That you might think is the main issue in this trial. There is no dispute that the forms were lodged and in relation to the attempt charge, that the accused did attempt to lodge the forms by submitting them through to the ATO. The issue is whether he engaged in deceptive or dishonest conduct, whether he fraudulently attempted or did in fact obtain financial advantages to which his relevant company was not entitled.”


	
	In summarising the Crown case, her Honour identified this issue as a prerequisite to the Crown proving its case beyond reasonable doubt:
	


“I must emphasise that the Crown case relies upon you accepting beyond reasonable doubt that there were no genuine commercial business transactions between the accused’s companies and BJ Multilink Investments Pty Ltd or James Chan acting on behalf of that company. Or, at the very least, that you would reject that as being reasonably possible based on all of the evidence that has been placed before you. The reason that the Crown must prove beyond reasonable doubt that there were no genuine commercial business transactions between the accused’s companies and BJ Multilink Investments is because such a finding would be a prerequisite if you like to the Crown being able to prove that the accused’s conduct was deceptive and that he acted dishonestly.

In other words if you consider that there were, or that it is reasonably possible that there were, legitimate, genuine, commercial business transactions between the accused’s company and BJ Multilink Investments Pty Ltd and that goods were exported, then there has been no deception or no attempt to deceive the ATO because the accused’s companies would then have been entitled to claim the refund.”


	
	The essence of the submissions made in support of the ground by counsel for the applicant is stated in the ground itself. Put shortly, in order to prove that the lies had been told the Crown had to prove its case. If the Crown proved its case, there was no point in the jury then considering whether the lies were indicative of consciousness of guilt. The jury were invited to engage in what has been described in the authorities as “circular” or “bootstraps” reasoning. Counsel referred to a number of authorities, principally R v Zheng (1995) 83 A Crim R 572, but others as well including R v Lane (No 13) [2010] NSWSC 1540; R v Lane [2011] NSWCCA 157; 221 A Crim R 309; R v Mercer (1993) 67 A Crim R 91; and R v Laz [1998] 1 VR 453.
	


Submissions for the Crown


	
	The Crown submitted that R v Zheng was distinguishable in the same way as it was found to be distinguishable in R v Lane (2011). This was said to be on the basis that even though proof of lies was essential to a finding of guilt, proof that lies had been told did not require proving guilt. It was submitted that, as in R v Lane (2011), the case that proved that the accused had lied was part of but not completely coextensive with the case that proved guilt, or, as Simpson J put it (at [61]), “a circumstantial case within a circumstantial case”.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the following evidence was available to prove the lies:
	



	
	provision by the applicant to the ATO of the first set of BJ Multilink invoices during the Allrange audit
	
	
	provision by the applicant of the Allrange Westpac account records
	
	
	evidence from Tina Cheung and Westpac of the structured “churning” transactions involving Allrange cheques referred to in the BJ Multilink invoices
	
	
	the electronic files found on the SD cards seized from the applicant’s home showing that in many cases he prepared the BJ Multilink invoices shortly before they were provided to the ATO
	
	
	provision by the applicant to the ATO after the completion of the Allrange audit of BJ Multilink invoices that for the first time referred to the offset arrangements
	
	
	evidence of the directors of BJ Multilink, Messrs Gu and Ou, as to its limited trading activities; lack of any dealings with Allrange or Sparktec; and that James Chan never worked for BJ Multilink
	
	
	evidence of the lack of any BASs of BJ Multilink that might correspond with the applicant’s asserted dealings between it and Allrange and Sparktec
	
	
	evidence from the Customs officer that BJ Multilink had no exports during the indictment period
	
	
	evidence of the modest supplies of phones to BJ Multilink by its three main suppliers
	
	
	evidence of the ATO’s audit contact with Tak Yu (James) Chan and the contradictory evidence of his travel movements
	



	
	Two further matters relied upon in the Crown's closing address to the jury might be added to this list:
	


(11)   the inherently improbable proposition that a 19 year-old student, James Chan, or BJ Multilink itself, had amassed a $15 million debt to the Hong Kong companies

(12)   the implausible proposition that the applicant derived no profit from the complex offset arrangement he ascribed to his dealings with BJ Multilink and the Hong Kong companies.


	
	The Crown submitted that this evidence was capable of proving that the applicant had lied about the genuineness of the BJ Multilink invoices and the existence of the offset arrangements but the evidence could not, on its own, prove the applicant’s guilt of the offences charged. It could not prove the essential elements of dishonest deception by causing false BASs to be lodged with the ATO, nor that the applicant obtained (or attempted to obtain) a financial advantage. Even though there might not have been issues raised by the defence about those elements, it was still necessary for the jury to consider whether they had been proved beyond reasonable doubt. And, the body of evidence to prove all of the essential aspects of the Crown case was broad and complex; far greater than that which was necessary to prove the applicant had lied about the genuineness of the BJ Multilink transactions.
	
	
	So, the Crown submitted, the body of evidence from which the asserted lies were proved was not co-extensive with the overall Crown case that proved guilt. The direction did not invite the jury to engage in circular reasoning. It was also submitted that the judge’s clear directions as to the need for proof beyond reasonable doubt as to each essential element of the offences, a matter about which she reminded the jury at the very end of the summing up, removed any potential for confusion (if there was any potential at all).
	


Submissions in response


	
	Mr Lange indicated that there was no dispute that, if the Crown proved the falsity of the applicant’s assertions that the BJ Multilink transactions were genuine then, all of the essential elements of its case would be established. He submitted that the same could be seen in R v Zheng where proof of the lie did not establish all of the essential elements; the focus was on what was the real issue between the parties. In the present case there was really only one issue: had the Crown proved beyond reasonable doubt that the BJ Multilink transactions were not genuine.
	
	
	This prompted a question from the bench as to whether there was any miscarriage of justice arising from the direction having been given if proof of guilt and proof of the lie was one and the same thing. Mr Lange submitted that it invited confusion for the jury. Lies were not something that had to be proved beyond reasonable doubt. The jury could be satisfied that the accused lied about the BJ Multilink transactions being genuine; infer that he lied out of consciousness of guilt; and then use that to conclude beyond reasonable doubt that the BJ Multilink transactions were not genuine.
	


Consideration


	
	During the course of argument, counsel for the applicant indicated he was content for the lie the subject of this ground to be characterised simply as being that the applicant said the BJ Multilink transactions were real and genuine. There were components to that lie but, broadly speaking, that was the essence of the Crown’s contention. I will confine my references accordingly.
	
	
	The applicant's submission that the direction should not have been given should be accepted. The practical reality of this case was that if the jury accepted that there were no genuine commercial business transactions between the applicant's companies and BJ Multilink they would inevitably find that the offences were proved. Once the jury were satisfied of the falsity of the applicant's account concerning this issue, there was nothing else in dispute. It is inconceivable that the jury might have had any doubt about the other essential aspects of the Crown case once they were satisfied of such falsity.
	
	
	There was no need for a consciousness of guilt direction concerning the applicant's claim that the BJ Multilink transactions were real and genuine. Hoeben CJ at CL observed in Gall v R; Gall v R [2015] NSWCCA 69 at [86] that:
	


""the rationale behind the need for a consciousness of guilt direction by a trial judge is that the particular conduct relied upon by the Crown, while being capable of allowing a legitimate inference of guilt, may also be readily explained by another innocent or less culpable motivation.""


	
	In that case, it was held (at [90]) that a less culpable explanation of post offence conduct was available but it constituted the appellant's defence (that he was acting in self-defence). The issue for the jury was whether the Crown had excluded that explanation which was described (at [92]) as ""the fundamental question for the jury to decide"". A ground asserting error by the trial judge in not giving a consciousness of guilt direction was rejected.
	
	
	The ""fundamental question for the jury to decide"" in the present case was whether the BJ Multilink explanation was false.
	
	
	This case is factually similar to R v Wang, (Court of Criminal Appeal (NSW), 11 February 1994, unrep) in that proof that an assertion was a lie was coextensive withy proof of guilt. Wang was alleged to have murdered his two flatmates but he gave an alternative version in a police interview and in his evidence in the trial that a group of four men had come to the home, killed the flatmates and forced him to assist with dumping the bodies. The Crown asserted that this account was a lie and the trial judge directed the jury in accordance with R v Lucas (1981) 1 QB 720 about using lies as evidence of a consciousness of guilt. Finlay J (with whom Hunt CJ at CL and Allen J agreed) said that the direction was an error. He continued:
	


""The appellant's story of the gang of four being responsible was inextricably interwoven with the appellant's denial of his own guilt. In the circumstances of this case it was necessary for the jury to find that the appellant had committed the murders in order to find that his ‘Gang of Four’ statement was a lie. To suggest that his story in that regard was false was to suggest that his denial of his guilt was false. Any suggestion that the denial by an accused person of his guilt can in some way be found to be a lie which may assist a jury to find him guilty is obviously a circulatory argument and is erroneous.""


	
	So too in the present case; the assertion in the applicant's evidence that the BJ Multilink transactions were real and genuine was ""inextricably interwoven with the applicant's denial of his own guilt"".
	
	
	Notwithstanding the error, the Court in R v Wang applied the proviso in s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), it being held that there was no substantial miscarriage of justice.
	
	
	Lane (2011) is distinguishable. In that case it was essential to proof of the respondent's guilt that the Crown establish that she had lied when she claimed that she had given her child into the care of other people. (If that was possibly true, then she could not have killed the child.) As Simpson J observed (at [59]), ""while that was a necessary condition for conviction, it was far from a sufficient condition for conviction"". Her Honour said (at [61]-[62]) that the circumstantial case relied upon by the Crown to establish that the claims were lies was not entirely co-extensive with the circumstantial case relied upon to prove the murder. There were other circumstances in the Crown's circumstantial case on murder that were independent of the lies; for example, tendency evidence relating to the respondent having given away to adoption children born before and after the birth of the baby allegedly murdered.
	
	
	This is not a case in which there was a risk of ""bootstraps"" reasoning in the sense explained by Neave JA in R v Sirillas [2006] VSCA 234. Her Honour said:
	


[19] Bootstraps reasoning occurs when the jury must assume that the accused has committed the offence with which he or she has been charged, for the purpose of deciding whether the statement they have made is a lie (See for example R v Laz [1998] 1 VR 453 at 466; R v Gionfriddo (1990) 50 A Crim R 327; R v Smith [2002] VSCA 219 at [109]). This is to be contrasted with the case where an assertion of fact is not a general denial of guilt but relates to a material issue which is relevant in determining the accused’s guilt. In the latter situation a lie told by the accused may permit an inference to be drawn that he or she lied to conceal guilt, which, when that inference is combined with other evidence, may be sufficient to justify conviction (R v Lam & Ors (Ruling no. 18) [2005] VSC 292 at [26], per Redlich J).


	
	In the present case, I do not see any way in which the lies issue went to the jury could have invited the application of such an illegitimate process of reasoning. A substantial amount of the Crown case was devoted solely to proof that the BJ Multilink version of the accused was false. The whole focus of the way in which the parties presented their respective cases was on that issue. An assumption of guilt and then application of it to determine the falsity of the accused's account would have been so perverse and irrational that I cannot contemplate the possibility of it having occurred.
	
	
	Counsel for the applicant's contention that the jury could have been satisfied that the accused lied about the BJ Multilink transactions being genuine, inferred that he lied out of consciousness of guilt, and then used that to conclude beyond reasonable doubt that the BJ Multilink transactions were not genuine is not borne out as a realistic possibility either for the same reason.
	
	
	As I have said, the principal focus of the evidence and submissions was the applicant's BJ Multilink explanation. The vast majority of the case was devoted to it. The evidence upon which the Crown relied, succinctly summarised by the points made in its submissions in this Court (see above at [53]), in my assessment, was overwhelming. There was no substantial miscarriage of justice.
	
	
	Accordingly, while leave to appeal against conviction should be granted, I would dismiss the appeal.
	


Application for leave to appeal against sentence


	
	The sole ground of appeal against sentence is:
	


Her Honour erred in referring to the offences having involved innocent third parties


	
	When dealing with the objective seriousness of the offences the sentencing judge said:
	


“In summary, each offence individually and looked at in total:

1.   took place over a lengthy period of time;

2.   involved sustained deception involving the submission of 27 false Business Activity Statements’ such that even when some of these statements were queried by the ATO, at which time the offender had the opportunity to desist had he wished to do so, the offender continued his fraudulent activities ultimately switching from using Allrange to using Sparktec in order to exploit the ATO for his own benefit;

3.    involved significant planning and significant sustained efforts to avoid detection;

4.    was motivated by greed;

5.    breached the trust inherent in the self-reporting of taxation liabilities;

6.    involved innocent third parties, namely Ms Candy Cheung and Ms Tina Cheung, in their implantation;

7.   in the case of counts 8 to 18 and 20 to 22 involved significant sums of money and these counts alone would call for a significant term of imprisonment;

8.    the amount of money involved in counts 1 to 22 and 24 totalling $1,396,285.76 has not been recovered; and

9.    the offending ended only upon the arrest of the offender.”

   (Emphasis added.)


	
	Her Honour immediately expressed her conclusion: ""the offences committed by the offender are objectively very serious"".
	
	
	Counsel submitted in this Court that there was no evidence that either Ms Candy Cheung or Ms Tina Cheung did anything other than what they were advised to do by the applicant. No interest of theirs was prejudiced in any way, and the offences were not more difficult to detect because of their involvement. As a consequence, it was wrong for her Honour to take into account the involvement of these third persons in assessing the objective gravity of the offences.
	
	
	Her Honour did not explain how it was that the involvement by the applicant of these two people was relevant to the objective seriousness of the offences. There are a number of ways in which it could have been. It could be indicative of brazenness on the part of the applicant to risk exposure if either or both of them discerned any illegality or impropriety in his conduct. It could be indicative of the complexity of his fraudulent scheme. It might reflect a degree of callousness in that the applicant was prepared to use innocent agents to do his bidding in furtherance of his scheme. These types of matters may be regarded as part of ""the nature and circumstances of the offence"" and of the applicant's ""course of conduct consisting of a series of criminal acts""; matters required to be taken into account by s 16A(2) of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth).
	
	
	What was most significant in an assessment of the objective seriousness of the offences was that they involved a sustained period of repeated fraudulent claims as part of an elaborate scheme to derive (or attempt to derive) large sums of money in a contemptuous manipulation of the self-reporting GST/BAS scheme solely for the applicant's own enrichment.
	
	
	I do not regard the sentencing judge's inclusion of the impugned subject in the list of matters she regarded as relevant to the seriousness of the offences as erroneous. Even if it was, it pales when compared to more significant matters such that this complaint can be regarded as hypercritical nit-picking.
	
	
	I would refuse leave to appeal against sentence.
	


Orders


	
	I propose the following orders:
	


1. Leave to appeal against conviction granted.

2. Appeal dismissed.

3. Leave to appeal against sentence refused.

		29 May 2015",2015-05-28 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2703350,Cowan v R [2015] NSWCCA 118,"Judgment


	
	BATHURST CJ: In this matter, I have had the advantage of reading the judgments of Simpson J and Bellew J in draft.
	
	
	I agree with the orders proposed by Bellew J and, subject to what I have written below, with his Honour’s reasons.
	
	
	For the reasons given by Simpson J, I have some doubt whether the sentencing judge properly took into account the applicant’s youth in imposing the sentence. However, having regard to the applicant’s success on the other grounds of appeal, it is unnecessary to pursue the matter further.
	
	
	SIMPSON J: I have read in draft the judgment of Bellew J. I agree with the orders proposed, and with his Honour’s reasoning in respect of Grounds 1 and 3, and his proposed disposition of Ground 4. I express some hesitation as to his Honour’s reasoning in respect of Ground 2, concerning the applicant’s youth and immaturity.
	
	
	The relevance of youth and immaturity in sentencing is well established. It is an important sentencing consideration, for reasons stated in many cases, for example R v Hearne [2001] NSWCCA 37; 124 A Crim R 451 and BP v R [2010] NSWCCA 159; 201 A Crim R 379, and the many cases cited therein. In my opinion, the obligation to give adequate consideration, in a particular case, to the youth and immaturity of the offender is not discharged by mere reference to the offender’s age, or to the offender as a “young person”. Merely to note the age or youth of an offender, in such a way as to demonstrate that the sentencing judge is aware of the offender’s age, is not sufficient to show that the appropriate sentencing principles were taken into account.
	
	
	In this case, the applicant was 18 years and 4 months at the time of the offending. The evidence established clearly that his youth and immaturity materially contributed to his decision to participate. However, in the circumstances of this case, those factors were integrally entwined with this intellectual disability. Both factors were relevant to the assessment of the applicant’s moral culpability for the offence. It was not, of course, necessary - and it was not desirable - that the judge specify any reduction he made relevant to each of those factors. But it was necessary that he make clear that he took all relevant sentencing considerations into account. I am not persuaded that the applicant’s youth and immaturity did go into the overall evaluation of moral culpability.
	
	
	Notwithstanding that, I am satisfied that the sentence proposed by Bellew J adequately encompasses all relevant sentencing considerations, including the applicant’s youth and immaturity.
	
	
	I agree with the orders proposed.
	
	
	BELLEW J: Glen Eric Cowan (“the applicant”) pleaded guilty before the Local Court to an offence of aggravated break and enter and commit serious indictable offence (namely larceny) contrary to s. 112(2) of the Crimes Act 1900. The maximum penalty applicable to that offence is 20 years imprisonment. A standard non-parole period of 5 years is prescribed.
	
	
	The applicant adhered to that plea in the District Court and asked the sentencing judge to take into account two additional offences contained on a Form 1, namely:
	



	
	being carried in conveyance without the consent of the owner (contrary to s. 154A(1)(b) of the Crimes Act 1900); and
	
	
	dishonestly obtaining a benefit by deception (contrary to s. 192E(1)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900).
	



	
	Both of the matters on the Form 1 arose at or about the time of the offending in [9] above.
	
	
	On 25 June 2014, the applicant was sentenced by Acting Judge Black to imprisonment for 3 years and 9 months with a non-parole period of 2 years and 3 months. The applicant now seeks leave to appeal against that sentence on the grounds more fully set out below.
	


THE FACTS


	
	Between about 9:40pm on 2 September 2013 and 1:50am on 3 September 2013 a Nissan Patrol (“the vehicle”) was stolen from a residence in the northern NSW township of Casino. At about 1:53am on 3 September 2013 the vehicle entered a service station and pulled up to a petrol pump. A person later identified as the applicant got out of the vehicle. His carriage in the vehicle up to that time was the subject of the first of the matters contained in the Form 1.
	
	
	The applicant was seen on CCTV footage to cover his hands with the sleeves of his jumper before filling the vehicle with fuel. A security guard observed that the driver of the vehicle had not shut down the engine while it was being refuelled. This caused the security guard to think that the driver may leave without paying for the fuel. Because of this he wrote down the vehicle’s registration number.
	
	
	The applicant put 24.44 litres of fuel, the value of which was $37.96, into the vehicle. The applicant got back into the vehicle and it was driven away without paying for the fuel. The failure to pay for the fuel is the subject of the second of the matters on the Form 1.
	
	
	At about 2:39am on 3 September 2013 CCTV footage recorded the vehicle in the township of Evans Head, where it was seen to reverse from the road straight through the front doors of a bottle shop which was adjacent to the Illawong Hotel. As a result of the impact, the doors of the bottle shop (which were closed and locked at the time) were shattered. Six people, one of whom was the applicant, got out of the vehicle and ran inside. The applicant, who was wearing socks on his hands, pulled the hood of his jumper down over his face. Along with his co-offenders he ransacked the bottle shop and stole alcohol, cigarettes and cigarette lighters before leaving in the vehicle. The cost of repairs to the premises was $8,209.50. The value of the stock which was stolen was $8,093.07.
	
	
	The vehicle was recovered, burnt out, at about 8:30am on 3 September 2013 in a park in Casino. A search of the nearby area resulted in the seizure of (inter alia) a “Bic” brand cigarette lighter, identical to the type stolen from the bottle shop.
	
	
	The applicant was recognised by a police officer who viewed the CCTV footage taken at the bottle shop. Police then attended premises where they located a number of people including the applicant. Bottles of alcohol, cigarettes and cigarette lighters identical to those stolen during the raid were seized from various rooms within the premises. Other items seized included a pair of black tracksuit pants in which police located packets of cigarettes, a cigarette lighter and a wallet containing the applicant’s identification. In another bedroom police located a green coloured jumper that the applicant was seen to be wearing on the previous evening.
	


THE GROUNDS OF APPEAL

Ground 1 – His Honour failed to take into account and apply the principles relevant to sentencing an intellectually disabled offender

The evidence before the sentencing judge


	
	There was considerable evidence before the sentencing judge concerning the applicant’s mental state.
	
	
	Firstly, there was correspondence dated 11 October 2012 from Ian Nisbet, a senior specialist psychologist from the Forensic Mental Health Program of Juvenile Justice. Mr Nisbet reported that following assessment, the applicant’s FSIQ score was found to be 44.
	
	
	Secondly, a case note tendered to the sentencing judge recorded the details of a consultation between the applicant and Ms Katie Stephen, psychologist on 21 March 2014. The case note documented the results of an assessment of the applicant’s cognitive functioning as follows:
	


“The results of this assessment indicated that Mr Cowan’s score fell within the Extremely Low range of cognitive functioning (Moderate). His score falls within the range of someone having an intellectual disability. Accordingly, he would experience difficulty in keeping up with his peers in a wide variety of situations that require age appropriate thinking and reasoning abilities.”


	
	The assessment of the applicant’s level of cognitive functioning was later amended to mild as opposed to moderate.
	
	
	Thirdly, there was a pre-sentence report dated 27 February 2013. It described the applicant’s level of engagement throughout the interview as “limited”, and his cognition as “significantly affected”. The author of the report went on to state:
	


“He did not appear to comprehend either the assessment process or his precarious situation.”


	
	The author also stated:
	


“His psychosocial functioning also appeared affected by significant cognitive deficits, manifested in a lack of understanding regarding his legal requirements. To that end, further assessment regarding his level of functioning appeared warranted.”


	
	Finally, a report from Professor David Greenberg, psychiatrist, dated 2 June 2004 was tendered before the sentencing judge. Having examined the applicant’s mental status, Professor Greenberg’s provisional diagnoses included:
	



	
	intellectual impairment with learning disorder;
	
	
	attention deficit disorder; and
	
	
	alcohol and cannabis abuse/dependence.
	



	
	Professor Greenberg went on to say the following:
	


“The writer is of the opinion there are reasonable grounds to believe that Mr Cowan suffers from a developmental disability. According to the pre-sentence report and the Juvenile Justice background report, Mr Cowan has been diagnosed as having intellectual disability (mental retardation) associated with learning disorder. It is reported that Mr Cowan’s mother drank alcohol in significant quantities during her pregnancy. It is therefore likely that Mr Cowan has Foetal Alcohol Syndrome which is associated with intellectual disability. He is also been diagnosed with Attention Deficit Disorder. He has a history of alcohol and cannabis abuse and also has used amphetamines. He has significant personality problems with antisocial features which has been evidence (sic) since his early adolescence period.

With regard to treatment recommendations the writer is of the opinion that Mr Cowan may benefit from drug and alcohol counselling. He may benefit from psychological counselling for his personality problems. It is imperative he abstain from all alcohol and other illicit substances for an indefinite period. Further use of these substances is likely to exacerbate his personality problems.”

The sentence proceedings


	
	The submissions made to the sentencing judge by the applicant’s solicitor regarding the applicant’s mental state commenced at T15 L36:
	


“Your Honour sees that there’s clearly issues with drugs and alcohol and as far as a residential type setting, there is nothing that is available to Mr Cowan at this particular point. But certainly during a period of supervision, it may be that he could be considered. He was certainly considered suitable for the Namatjira Haven Program, but there is not a place available to him at this time.

But on a period of supervision, he has expressed his willingness to take part in any type of program that would address those drug and alcohol issues. Your Honour I’d ask your Honour to take into account the recommendations that were contained in a report, the psychiatric report that was prepared by Justice Health.”


	
	Having quoted from that part of the report of Professor Greenberg regarding the likely benefits of counselling, the applicant’s solicitor continued (commencing at T16 L5):
	


“Those recommendations, in my submission, are things that could be incorporated into a period of supervision on parole. What I am asking your Honour to consider is – I’m asking your Honour to find that there are special circumstances in relation to Mr Cowan and that the normal ratio could be adjusted to reflect those special circumstances, so that there would be shorter period of time in custody followed by a lengthier period on parole.”


	
	No further submission was made regarding the applicant’s mental state. In particular, no reference was made to the principles regarding the sentencing of mentally ill offenders.
	
	
	The Crown’s written submissions on sentence did not address the issue of the applicant’s mental state. However in oral submissions in reply the Crown (commencing at T18 L23) expressly acknowledged the applicant’s “undoubted intellectual disability”. Nevertheless, the Crown submitted that the applicant knew that his offending was wrong and that this circumstance necessarily reduced the weight to be given to his mental state.
	
	
	Whilst acknowledging that the matter may not be “clear cut” the Crown continued (commencing at T18 L48):
	


“Certainly there would be elements of impulse control that your Honour may be minded to take into account when determining the moral culpability of Mr Cowan, given the intellectual disability he labours under.

The Crown’s submission is the objective evidence shows that notwithstanding the intellectual disability, that the objective evidence is clear, that he knew what he was doing was wrong. He took some steps – not all steps that could be taken – but some steps to avoid detection.

There is not any evidence in the footage available to show clear intoxication or the like and that while the Crown certainly concedes that it is relevant – and that is conceded – that the weight that ought be given to it ought not be disproportionate to the objective evidence available. That’s the Crown’s submission in respect to that subjective feature.”

The findings of the sentencing judge


	
	The sentencing judge said the following (commencing at ROS 3):
	


“Now as far as he is concerned there is clear evidence, and it is principally from Professor Greenberg but there is plenty of other evidence, that what Professor Greenberg chooses to call a developmental disability, which he amplifies as intellectual disability, mental retardation, associated with learning disorder is significantly present in the case of this young man. He also has ADD, according to the Professor, and there have been significant alcohol and drug issues in the past.

With that very much in mind that although he appears to have taken some steps of sadly inadequate nature from his point of view to conceal his identity, and although obviously there was planning, somebody decided that the vehicle was going to be stolen, somebody decided that it would be fuelled up and somebody decided that the target was over in Evans Head. There is absolutely no basis for regarding this young man as a prime mover in the planning organisation of this and indeed the Crown very frankly said the matters referred to as involving some planning are not put forward by way of aggravation against this offender, a very understandable approach in view of the background material about his educational and mental capacity. It is quite clear to me, having heard his sister who has been good enough to come to court and give evidence about him, that he is a vulnerable young man who is made use of as an experienced participant in matters such as this by others minded to carry out criminal activity. Regrettably he should have known better than to go along with anything of the sort because of his previous activities but I regard him as ready to go along with suggested wrong doing but not being the instigator of it, and I just repeat that the statement of facts shows that when the ram-raid achieved entry to the premises, he took an active physical part in abstracting some of the contents.”


	
	Having accepted that the applicant came from a disadvantaged and deprived background, his Honour then said (at ROS 4):
	


“He is in need of intensive assistance down the track and that is where I come to now. It is submitted in the final assessment I should find special circumstances. That is conceded by the Crown and obviously the material fully justifies such a finding. The particular bases of that are the report of Professor Greenberg dated 2 June 2014, the material tendered by the defence and he obviously needs more time on parole than the normal sentence would involve.”


	
	His Honour made no specific reference to the principles applicable to sentencing mentally ill offenders.
	


Submissions of the applicant


	
	It was submitted on behalf of the applicant that the sentencing judge had failed to consider whether:
	



	
	the applicant was an appropriate vehicle for general deterrence in light of his mental state;
	
	
	the applicant’s reduced capacity to reason as to the wrongfulness of his conduct lessened his moral culpability; and
	
	
	the need for retribution and denunciation was reduced in light of the applicant’s mental state.
	



	
	It was submitted that in these circumstances, the sentencing judge had fallen into error by failing to consider and apply the principles relevant to the sentencing of mentally ill offenders.
	


Submissions of the Crown


	
	The Crown pointed out that no submission was made on behalf of the applicant to the sentencing judge regarding:
	



	
	the degree to which the applicant’s moral culpability was reduced because of his mental state; or
	
	
	the reduced need for retribution and/or denunciation on account of such mental state.
	



	
	The Crown argued that in circumstances where the submissions made on behalf of the applicant were restricted in the way that I have outlined, the absence of any reference by the sentencing judge to the applicant’s suitability (or otherwise) as a vehicle for general deterrence was unremarkable, and was not indicative of error. The Crown also relied on the fact that the sentencing remarks had been delivered ex tempore, immediately following submissions.
	


Consideration


	
	It has been observed by this Court on a number of occasions that it is inappropriate to take an overly critical approach to reasons for sentence which are delivered ex tempore, immediately following sentencing proceedings: see for example Gommesen v R [2012] NSWCCA 226 per Garling J at [37]-[38], McClellan CJ at CL and McCallum JJ agreeing; Warner aka Jeremy Pachenko v R [2013] NSWCCA 10 per S Campbell J at [33], Hoeben CJ at CL and Davies J agreeing. However even when full allowance is given to that circumstance in the present case, I am persuaded that ground 1 has been made out.
	
	
	There was considerable evidence before the sentencing judge regarding the applicant’s mental state. In these circumstances, and notwithstanding the absence of any specific submission as to the principles governing the sentencing of mentally ill offenders, the sentencing judge was under an obligation to consider those principles and, if appropriate, to apply them. I am fortified in that view by the recent observations of Price J (with whom Hidden and Schmidt JJ agreed) in Martin v R [2015] NSWCCA 6 at [53]:
	


“It is evident from these opinions that the applicant’s mental disorders may have contributed to his offending. Although a specific submission was not made by the applicant’s counsel on this issue, the focus of the applicant’s case on sentence was his mental health. In my respectful opinion, the judge was obliged to expressly make some assessment as to whether the applicant’s moral culpability for the serious crimes that he committed was reduced by his mental condition. In assessing the objective seriousness of the offences, her Honour did not make any reference to the applicant’s mental health and erred in not doing so.”


	
	In the present case, there was a similar evidentiary focus upon the applicant’s mental health. The sentencing judge was under the obligation to which Price J referred. That extended to an obligation to consider the principles set out by McClellan CJ at CL in Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194; (2010) 79 NSWLR 1 at [177]-[178] regarding the relevance of mental illness on sentence. In my view, the sentencing judge failed to discharge those obligations and accordingly this ground is made out.
	
	
	As error has been found, the provisions of s. 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) are enlivened. In these circumstances it is the duty of this Court to exercise the sentencing discretion afresh in the manner outlined by the plurality in Kentwell v R [2014] HCA 37; (2014) 88 ALJR 947 at [42]-[43]. In doing so, the court must take into account all relevant statutory requirements, and all relevant sentencing principles: Baxter v R [2007] NSWCCA 237; (2007) 173 A Crim R 284 per Spigelman CJ at [19], cited with approval in Kentwell at [42].
	
	
	I will return to these issues after considering the remaining grounds.
	


Ground 2 – The sentencing judge failed to take into account the applicant’s youth

The evidence before the sentencing judge


	
	The applicant was born on 21 April 1995. He was therefore 18 years of age at the time of the offending and 19 at the time of sentence. His sister gave evidence in the sentence proceedings (at T10 L14-21) that he was easily influenced by others and that he sometimes found it hard to make the right decisions.
	
	
	The applicant’s solicitor made the following submissions to the sentencing judge as to the relevance of the applicant’s age (commencing at T15 L3):
	


“In my submission, with appropriate supervision, there certainly are some – there is some prospect of rehabilitation. Particularly taking into account his age and that he is only – he is 19 at the time of these offences. Your Honour this is clearly, this is the first time that he has been in adult custody and he has spent, for a first time in adult custody already, a significant period of time in custody, almost ten months.”


	
	Although there were subsequent references (at T16 L17 and 21) to the applicant’s age, such references were in the context of the applicant’s difficult upbringing.
	


The findings of the sentencing judge


	
	At the outset of his reasons the sentencing judge (at ROS 1) expressly referred to the fact that the applicant was aged 19 and had been in custody since the date of his arrest. He referred to him in the course of the remarks on sentence as a “young man” (at ROS 3.7 and 3.9). He expressed the view (at ROS 3.9) that he was “vulnerable” as a consequence of his youth.
	


Submissions of the applicant


	
	It was submitted on behalf of the applicant that the sentencing judge had failed to consider and apply the principles relevant to the sentencing of young offenders, and had made no reference to having taken into account the applicant’s youth when determining sentence.
	
	
	It was submitted that the applicant’s youth and immaturity, particularly in the light of his intellectual disability, had contributed to the commission of the offence and that there was evidence, which his Honour accepted, that the applicant was easily led and vulnerable to exploitation. It was submitted that the sentencing judge had erred in failing to take the applicant’s youth and immaturity into account.
	


Submissions of the Crown


	
	The Crown relied upon the fact that the sentencing judge had made specific reference to the applicant’s age. The Crown also relied on the finding that the applicant was a vulnerable person which, it was submitted, necessarily incorporated a finding that the applicant was immature. It was submitted that in these circumstances the “synthesis of the sentence” necessarily included considerations of the applicant’s age. The essence of the Crown’s submission was that these matters left no room to doubt that the sentencing judge had taken into account the applicant’s youth when determining sentence.
	


Consideration


	
	The sentencing judge did not make specific reference to the principles in relation to the relevance of youth on sentence. However, it is clear from the various references in [47] above that he was aware of the applicant’s age. It is also clear that he concluded that as a consequence of his age and immaturity, the applicant was vulnerable.
	
	
	I am satisfied in these circumstances that his Honour was aware of the applicant’s youth and that he took that (and related matters) into account on sentence.
	
	
	It follows that this ground is not made out.
	


Ground 3 – His Honour failed to consider the objective seriousness of the offence

The sentence proceedings


	
	In written submissions provided to the sentencing judge the Crown argued that the offending was “objectively serious” and that such seriousness was increased by virtue of the offending being in the nature of a “ram-raid”. The Crown also relied upon the fact that more than $8,000.00 damage was caused to the premises. It was submitted that this amount was over and above that which was ordinarily occasioned in matters of this nature and that in these circumstances the aggravating feature in s. 21A(2)(g) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW), namely that the damage caused by the offence was “substantial”, had been established.
	
	
	The Crown also relied on the fact that six people were involved in the offending. Whilst acknowledging that the aggravating feature in the offending was that the applicant was in company, and that it was therefore necessary to take care to avoid double counting, the Crown submitted that the large number of people involved in the offending was relevant to an assessment of its objective seriousness. In particular, it was submitted that although the offenders had been inside the premises for no more than 5 minutes, the large number of them meant that a significant amount of property was able to be taken in a short time, thus maximising the gain from the offending and minimising the risk of detection.
	
	
	No real issue was taken by the applicant’s solicitor to the Crown’s categorisation of the objective seriousness of the offence.
	


The findings of the sentencing judge


	
	Having summarised the facts of the offending the sentencing judge (commencing at ROS 2) made reference to the applicant’s criminal history. He then considered (at ROS 3) the report of Professor Greenberg before turning to the role played by the applicant in the offending. Having done so, his Honour said (at ROS 4):
	


“So in the light of all that I have to assess the appropriate sentence bearing in mind the standard non-parole period, although the law has changed about the approach to take to that; other authorities about ram-raids which unfortunately are fairly common and the way the courts look at it, and also bear in mind that this offender pleaded guilty at the outset and is entitled to full credit for that.”

Submissions of the applicant


	
	It was submitted on behalf of the applicant that the sentencing remarks were bereft of any assessment of the objective seriousness of the offending. It was submitted that such an assessment was essential to the task of the sentencing judge, and that had it been conducted it would have led to a finding that the objective seriousness of the offending was towards the lower end of the scale. It was submitted that his Honour’s failure to undertake such an assessment amounted to error.
	


Submissions of the Crown


	
	The Crown relied on the fact that there had been no real challenge at the sentence proceedings to the Crown’s written submissions regarding the objective seriousness of the offending. Further, the Crown submitted that although there was no express assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence, it was apparent from the sentencing judge’s references to various other matters that he had considered that issue.
	


Consideration


	
	In my view, the sentencing remarks do not reflect his Honour having made any assessment of the objective seriousness of the offending. Such assessment is an important part of the sentencing process: R v Campbell [2014] NSWCCA 102 at [27] per Simpson. The importance of that assessment is such that its absence in the present case cannot be explained by the fact that the remarks were delivered ex tempore.
	
	
	Moreover, as I have observed in respect of ground 1, his Honour failed to take into account and apply the principles relevant to sentencing a mentally ill offender, a consideration of which formed part of the assessment of objective seriousness. In McLaren v R [2012] NSWCCA 284 McCallum J (with whom McClellan CJ at CL and I agreed) said (at [29]):
	


“The decision in Muldrock does not, however, derogate from the requirement on a sentencing judge to form an assessment as to the moral culpability of the offending in question, which remains an important task in the sentencing process. That this assessment is also sometimes referred to as the ""objective seriousness"" of the offence perhaps contributes to the misconception. I do not understand the High Court to have suggested in Muldrock that a sentencing judge cannot have regard to an offender's mental state when undertaking that task (as an aspect of his or her instinctive synthesis of all of the factors relevant to sentencing).”


	
	In Elturk v R [2014] NSWCCA 61 Beazley P (with whom RA Hulme and Schmidt JJ agreed), said in reference to the decision in McLaren (at [34]):
	


“Her Honour’s analysis is, respectfully, not only correct, but aptly captures the relevance of moral culpability in the sentencing process.”


	
	In these circumstances, ground 3 is made out.
	


Ground 4 – The sentence imposed was manifestly excessive


	
	For the reasons stated I have found error in respect of grounds 1 and 3. This requires that the sentencing discretion be exercised afresh. In these circumstances, it is not incumbent upon the applicant to establish that the sentence imposed by the sentencing judge was manifestly excessive. I have considered the matters advanced by counsel for the applicant in support of this ground in determining whether some other sentence is warranted: Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) s. 6(3).
	


Is some other sentence warranted?


	
	The applicant’s offending was undoubtedly serious. It resulted in substantial damage being occasioned to the premises and a large quantity of goods being stolen.
	
	
	In terms of the applicant’s role, the agreed facts made specific reference to the fact that he:
	



	
	covered his hands with the sleeves of his jumper before refuelling the vehicle at the service station;
	
	
	pulled the hood of his jumper down over his face upon entering the bottle shop; and
	
	
	wore socks on his hands as he stole items from the bottle shop.
	



	
	These matters support a conclusion that the applicant’s offending was not spontaneous, that there was some degree of planning and that the applicant had some appreciation of his wrong doing. That said, there is nothing to suggest that the applicant played an organisational role in the offending. In fact, the evidence of the applicant’s youth and his associated vulnerability tends to the contrary.
	
	
	The medical evidence establishes that at the time of the offending the applicant had a mental disability which gave rise to a mild cognitive deficit. The case note of Ms Stephen specifically records that as a consequence of these matters, the applicant is a person who struggles in situations which require age appropriate thinking. There is other evidence, including that given by his sister on sentence, that he is easily influenced by others. I am satisfied in light of all of this evidence that there is a causal connection between the applicant’s mental state and his offending. This renders him an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence: De La Rosa at [177]-[178] per McClellan CJ at CL.
	
	
	All of these matters impact upon an assessment of the objective seriousness of the offending generally, and the applicant’s moral culpability in particular. They are consistent with the evidence given by the applicant’s sister that he is a person easily influenced by others who sometimes finds it hard to make the right decisions.
	
	
	In all of the circumstances, I would assess the objective seriousness of the offending as falling below the mid-range.
	
	
	In the event that this Court came to re-sentence the applicant, two affidavits of Claire O’Neill, solicitor, affirmed on 24 April 2015 and 27 April 2015 were read without objection. The first affidavit establishes that the applicant has been employed since being taken into custody, firstly in upholstery making and secondly in ground maintenance. The reports of his work performance have been generally good. The second affidavit annexed an affidavit from the applicant sworn on 24 April 2015 in which he confirmed his work history and stated that he had been allowed to work outside the confines of a minimum security facility in which had been housed because of his good behaviour. He is presently on a waiting list to undergo a Young Offender’s Program.
	
	
	I am satisfied on the evidence that the applicant has used his time in custody productively. He has pursued employment, as a consequence of which he has acquired new skills. He has also sought to pursue educational opportunities. He continues to have the support of his sister who gave evidence on his behalf at the sentence proceedings and with whom he maintains regular contact. He has expressed a desire to undertake an Arts Course through Lismore TAFE when he is released and has stated that another of his siblings has undertaken to support him with his efforts to reintegrate into the community. The sole custodial issue faced by the applicant was in January this year when traces of a substance which had not been prescribed for him were found in his urine. No other breaches of custodial discipline have been identified. The applicant is still a young man and all of these matters support a conclusion that he has good prospects of rehabilitation, notwithstanding his prior criminal history.
	
	
	The report of Professor Greenberg establishes that the applicant, who is Aboriginal, comes from a deprived background. His parents were both alcoholics and have been separated for some time. The applicant’s two older brothers reportedly have drug and alcohol issues. As a consequence of these matters, the applicant was raised by his grandparents. He attended school until year 9 but is both illiterate and innumerate. He reported behavioural problems at a young age, and has never worked on the open labour market. In my view, these circumstances warrant the application of the principles discussed in R v Fernando (1992) 76 A Crim R 58, and more recently in Bugmy v R [2013] HCA 37; (2013) 249 CLR 571. Those principles include the following:
	



	
	the deprived background of an Aboriginal offender may mitigate the sentence that would otherwise be appropriate: Bugmy at [37];
	
	
	the effect of deprivation does not diminish over time and must be given full weight in the determination of the appropriate sentence: Bugmy at [43];
	
	
	the experience of growing up in an environment surrounded by alcohol abuse and violence may leave its mark on a person throughout life: Bugmy at [44].
	



	
	In summary, the applicant’s subjective case establishes that he:
	



	
	is now 20 years of age and was 18 years of age at the time of the offending;
	
	
	entered an early plea of guilty for which he was entitled to a discount of 25 percent;
	
	
	has an impaired mental state which was causally connected to the offending;
	
	
	comes from a deprived and dysfunctional family background;
	
	
	is a person easily influenced by others;
	
	
	is in adult custody for the first time; and
	
	
	has good prospects of rehabilitation.
	



	
	Specifically as to (vii), I am satisfied on the evidence that there are significant positive signs which demonstrate that if the applicant is allowed a longer period on parole, rehabilitation is likely to be successful: R v Tuuta [2014] NSWCCA 40 at [57]. I therefore find special circumstances.
	
	
	In my view, the appropriate starting point is a sentence of 4 years imprisonment. As previously noted, the applicant is entitled to a discount of 25% on account of his early plea of guilty. The conclusion I have reached as to special circumstances will be reflected in the adjustment of the ratio between the total sentence and the non-parole period.
	


Orders


	
	In the exercise of the sentencing discretion afresh, I propose the following orders:
	



	
	Leave to appeal is granted.
	
	
	The appeal is allowed.
	
	
	The sentence imposed upon the applicant in the District Court is quashed.
	
	
	In lieu thereof, the applicant is sentenced to a non-parole period of 1 year and 10 months imprisonment commencing on 3 September 2013 and expiring on 2 July 2015, with a balance of term of 1 year and 2 months imprisonment commencing on 3 July 2015 expiring on 2 September 2016.

2703353,James v R [2015] NSWCCA 125,"Judgment


	
	HOEBEN CJ at CL:
	


OFFENCE AND SENTENCE

On 24 June 2013 the applicant, Anthony Mark James, was arraigned before McCallum J in the Supreme Court on a single count that on 26 May 2011 he did murder Dana Lomas. Dana Lomas was also known as Dale Lomas. The applicant entered a plea of not guilty and the trial proceeded.


	
	The jury retired to consider its verdict on 3 July 2013. On 9 July 2013 the jury returned a verdict of guilty of murder.
	
	
	On 25 July 2013, McCallum J sentenced the applicant to imprisonment with a non-parole period of 16 years, commencing 9 December 2012, with a balance of term of 5 years (R v James [2013] NSWSC 1560).
	
	
	The applicant seeks leave to appeal against his conviction and sentence on the following grounds:
	


Ground 1 – The verdict was unreasonable and cannot be supported having regard to the evidence.

Ground 1A – Her Honour erred in not leaving provocation as a partial defence to the jury.

Ground 2 – Her Honour erred in not taking into account the applicant’s onerous bail conditions for 18 months which were akin to house arrest.

Ground 3 – The sentence was manifestly excessive.

SUMMARY OF CROWN AND DEFENCE CASES


	
	The applicant and the deceased shared a house in Doonside. The majority of the witnesses in the Crown case provided background/context evidence of the relationship between the deceased and the applicant. Their evidence related to various instances of domestic violence and arguments.
	
	
	The medical evidence confirmed that the cause of death was a single stab wound, although the deceased did have some other injuries, most notably a fractured hyoid bone. There was pharmacological evidence that the level of methylamphetamine in the deceased’s blood meant that he had consumed drugs that day and may have been behaving in an aggressive manner. The applicant did not give evidence but his ERISP with the police at the scene was tendered (an audio tape).
	
	
	The Crown case, as put to the jury, was that the applicant had attacked the deceased, that the deceased had slashed out at him with the knife and that the applicant had wrestled the knife from him and stabbed him with it.
	
	
	The applicant had three lacerations to the right forearm that required stitches, one deep laceration to the left forearm that required stitches and was complaining of neck pain. There was no issue that these injuries were suffered as a result of being stabbed with the knife, nor was there any suggestion that these injuries were self inflicted.
	
	
	The effect of the applicant’s ERISP was that he and the deceased had a fight. The deceased had been shooting up and was drugged. He was enraged because the applicant was packing up to leave. The deceased had a knife and slashed at the applicant a couple of times. The applicant did not know what to do but eventually grabbed the knife from the deceased and stabbed him once. When asked what he was trying to do with the knife, the applicant said “Just protect myself”.
	


THE EVIDENCE

Senior Constable Donna White


	
	She was the Crime Scene Officer, who attended the deceased’s house. She found that the deceased was lying on the lounge with a blanket partially on him. The knife was next to the deceased in the blanket.
	


Gloria Anderson


	
	She was a sister of the deceased and would visit once or twice a week. She met the applicant on the deceased’s birthday on 14 May 2010 and she became aware that the applicant had moved in with the deceased in “probably late May, early June, around that time”. When she visited the deceased, the applicant would remain in his room. She was aware that at some stage the deceased had told the applicant to move out.
	
	
	From time to time after the applicant moved in with the deceased, she noticed or was told about several instances of violence against the deceased. These included a bruise on the deceased’s arm and bruising all over his body in October 2010 in respect of which the deceased said “Tony belted him”. On 19 March 2011 the deceased attended a cocktail party with his family. He returned shortly after leaving and said “Tony had told him to “f*** off” out of his house and chased him down the street with a knife”. She gave evidence of an occasion in early 2011 outside the deceased’s home when she heard the applicant say to the deceased “You’re a dog”. She said that “he was really angry at Dale, he was shouting at Dale”. On 25 May the deceased had bruising on his back that he said was the result of being beaten with a four by two by the applicant.
	
	
	In cross-examination Ms Anderson said that although she had heard the applicant yell at the deceased, she had never witnessed him harm the deceased. She said that the applicant had told her that he was a black belt in karate. She was aware that the deceased suffered from paranoid schizophrenia, depression and a sleeping disorder and that at the time of his death, he was not taking medication for these conditions. She said that in the months leading up to his death, the deceased was not looking after himself, had no money and was losing weight.
	
	
	She said that she was aware that the deceased was using illicit drugs - “That’s something we learned from someone else, plus we found syringes at his house” and “I did know Dale had no money because the money was being spent on the drugs for him and Tony”. She said that this drug use had started after the applicant moved in with the deceased. The deceased sometimes used the name “Dana King”, which was a female persona. He sometimes used the name “Stacey Wells”.
	
	
	In re-examination Ms Anderson said that the deceased would sometimes dress as a female. His hair was long and he wore it in a ponytail “all the time”.
	


Bella Winikerei


	
	She was a sister of the deceased. She and her partner lived with the deceased from November 2009 until 9 October 2010 and after moving out of the house, she continued to see the deceased most days. She met the applicant two weeks before the deceased’s birthday and the applicant moved into the house the Wednesday after the birthday (i.e. May 2010).
	
	
	In cross-examination Ms Winikerei said of the applicant, “For the first couple of weeks he was quiet. When I first moved in he was quiet, then after that he was rowdy because there were arguments”. She recalled a knife that the applicant had brought into the house which she described as having a “brown handle, and it’s the shape of a machete but a smaller version”. She had seen this knife in the deceased’s bedroom and later in the kitchen. Her drawing of this knife was exhibit B in the trial. She said that the deceased and the applicant shared a bedroom and that the deceased had told her that he loved the applicant.
	
	
	She described arguments between the applicant and the deceased and that the applicant “would be swearing at Dale, really abusive and like verbally” to which the deceased would respond telling the applicant to get f***ed. Ms Winikerei described several instances when the deceased told her that the applicant had assaulted him. These included scratches and bruises to his face in November 2010, bruising to his back and chest that the deceased said was the result of the applicant hitting him and burns on his arm that the deceased said were the result of the applicant putting a cigarette out on him. She said that in 2011 the deceased attended a cocktail party with his family and returned shortly after leaving claiming “the f***ing c*** chased me down the road with a knife out of my own home”.
	
	
	In cross-examination Ms Winikerei said that in the five month period she was living with the applicant and the deceased, she never saw the applicant physically harm the deceased. She said that the applicant told her that he was a black belt in karate. She said that the deceased told her of occasions when he had struck back at the applicant, including placing the applicant in a head lock and punching him.
	
	
	Ms Winikerei said that she had attended the deceased’s home to evict the applicant on the morning after the cocktail party. On that occasion the applicant had left the house without a fuss, but had not moved his things from the house. She said that in the week before 14 May 2011 the deceased told her that he had given the applicant seven days to move out.
	
	
	Ms Winikerei said that she had seen both the applicant and the deceased smoking “weed” but that she was unaware that the deceased was using methylamphetamine. She was aware that the deceased was experiencing “money issues”, despite the money that his family gave him. She had observed that “things were slowly going out of the house. That’s when I knew there were really money problems”.
	


Eileen Winikerei


	
	Eileen Winikerei was the niece of the deceased and the daughter of Bella Winikerei. She said that she would see the deceased two or three times a week and that although she saw the applicant several times, she only spoke to him once. The deceased told her that the applicant had left his wife to be with him. She described the deceased’s view of the relationship as “He was happy and then a few times after, and he wasn’t so happy after that. He was saying Tony was a black belt and he was scared of him.”
	
	
	Ms Eileen Winikerei said that although she did not see any violence inflicted on the deceased, he told her about two occasions when the applicant had assaulted him. The first was the night of the cocktail party in March 2011 when the deceased had left and returned to the party “crying and hysterical, just really upset” and told her that “Tony had chased him out of his own home with a knife”. The second was on 22 May 2011 when the deceased showed her bruising across his back.
	
	
	She had attended the deceased’s home on the morning after the cocktail party to evict the applicant. She said that the applicant had made a phone call and said words to the effect of “I need some boys to get these bitches out of the house” and argued with them, but had left the house.
	
	
	Ms Eileen Winikerei said that she was unaware that the deceased was using methylamphetamine, although she was aware that he was not eating properly. She said that she had never seen the applicant assault the deceased.
	


Sandra Crawford


	
	Ms Crawford lived in the same street and knew the deceased. The deceased used to come over and tell her about his problems with the applicant. He told her that the applicant “used to abuse him, physically hurt him”. She recalled the deceased once telling her that the applicant had held a knife to his throat and threatened to cut his throat.
	
	
	Ms Crawford said that she had witnessed an occasion when the applicant was violent towards the deceased. On 20 May 2011 she had alighted from a bus and was looking up the street when she saw the applicant (who was approximately six metres away) strike the deceased with a bed slat “Once, which missed and then he hit him a second time, then he hit him a third time”.
	
	
	In cross-examination Ms Crawford agreed that after being struck with the bed slat, she saw the deceased retrieve a five foot metal pole from the house and run down the street after the applicant with it. She denied that he had “chased” the applicant with it as “Tony was three quarters of the way down the road before Dale went after him”. Following this incident, the deceased attended Ms Crawford’s home and asked that she call the police which she did. He also showed her some marks on his back. Some time later the deceased again attended her home and asked her to cancel the call to the police which she refused to do.
	
	
	She said that she had seen the deceased on 26 May 2011 at approximately 5pm. He had come over for coffee and they had spoken for about four hours “about all things”, including that he had told the applicant to “be out by Tuesday”. She described the deceased as “swearing. He was upset”. She agreed that she had never seen the deceased so angry as on the night he died.
	


Peter Rofe


	
	He lived in the same street and knew both the applicant and the deceased as acquaintances. He described an incident on 20 May 2011 when the deceased assaulted the applicant. The applicant had been working on his car in the next door neighbour’s driveway when the deceased approached him yelling and screaming and waving a metre long stick and then chased the applicant around the van twice. During this the deceased threw the wood at the applicant several times. Mr Rofe said that the incident ended when the deceased threw the wood which knocked the support for the van boot, which came down and hit the deceased on the head. The deceased then walked away towards a neighbour’s house. Mr Rofe said that the deceased was yelling at the applicant that he wanted him out of his house, calling him a “piece of shit” and that the applicant was telling the deceased to “settle down”.
	
	
	Mr Rofe said that during this incident the applicant “wasn’t aggressive or anything. He was just dodging him and Dale wanted to hit him with a piece of wood”. On 26 May 2011 Mr Rofe said that he saw the applicant working on his van in the next door neighbour’s driveway for a couple of hours around 2.30 – 3 pm. The applicant appeared to be in good spirits at that time.
	


Blake Pardey


	
	Blake Pardey did not give evidence but by consent his statement was read onto the record. He lived in the same street as the deceased and described an incident which he had seen a week before the death. He was returning home in a car when he saw the deceased chasing a man down the street and across a paddock with a Samurai sword. He did not recognise the man being chased and described him as a man of Middle Eastern appearance with short black hair, 170 – 175 cms tall.
	


Julie Pardey


	
	Julie Pardey was the mother of Blake Pardey and lived in the same street as the deceased. She described an incident which she observed on 24 May 2011 when she was driving home. She saw a male chasing another man down the street with a machete. She described the man as “running for his life” and that the person pursuing him “was chasing him like he was ready to kill him”. She did not recognise the man running away as she only saw him from behind. She said that he was of medium to solid build. The man who was chasing him had brown skin and long black hair in a ponytail. She said that this man often used to wear his hair in a ponytail. She recognised him as someone who lived in her street.
	
	
	In cross-examination she agreed that she had seen the man running away once before – he had been looking at some scrap metal in a truck opposite her house. She later reported this incident to the police. She said that it really looked like the ponytailed man was ready to kill the other man.
	


Kirralee Howley


	
	Ms Howley used to reside with her mother and brother in the street. She said that on 24 May 2011 she was on her way to their home when she observed a male chasing another male down the street with a Samurai sword. She described the man being chased as 160 – 170 cms tall, of solid build with fair skin and very short, light brown hair. She said the man chasing him was 170 – 180 cms tall, very skinny build, tanned coloured skin with black hair in a pigtail or ponytail. She had seen this man a number of times in the street.
	


Hediye Sonmez


	
	Ms Sonmez lived in the street and knew both the deceased and the applicant as acquaintances. She described the deceased as being approximately 5 foot 8 inches tall, slim, long dark curly hair to his shoulders, sometimes clean shaven, with brown eyes and olive skin. She described the other man living there, whom she knew as Tony, as being of medium build, light brown hair, with blue-green eyes and she thought a little taller than the deceased, although she was not sure.
	
	
	She was aware that the deceased and the applicant were living together and agreed in cross-examination that the applicant had been living in his van for several months before he moved in with the deceased. She said that on 20 March 2011 the deceased approached her and showed her marks on his back that he said were the result of a fight with the applicant. She recalled a conversation in mid March when the deceased told her that the applicant kept going back to his wife and that he wanted the applicant to move out of his house.
	


Raylene Gregg


	
	Ms Gregg did not give evidence but by consent, her statement was read. She lived in the street and knew the deceased by sight. She described an incident approximately two weeks before the death when she saw the deceased yelling and chasing a yellow ute down the street, although she was unable to hear what was said.
	
	
	On 26 May 2011 at some time between 5.30 and 6pm, she observed a heated conversation between two men on the deceased’s driveway. As it was dark she had limited vision and could only describe their height and build. She was unable to hear what was said, however, she noted that “the tone of the voices appeared heated” and that the “smaller man also appeared to do more talking than the bigger man”.
	


Michael McCluskey


	
	Mr McCluskey was unable to give evidence as he had passed away before the hearing. His statement was read by consent. He had known the applicant for 20 years and the deceased for 10 years. He said that although the two men were living together, they were not in a relationship – he described the deceased as “gay” but said that the applicant was not. He was aware that the deceased had told the applicant to move out and was waiting for this to happen.
	
	
	He knew that the two men argued, but he had never seen them be violent towards one another. The deceased told him that the applicant had “given him a clip across the earhole”.
	
	
	On 26 May 2011 Mr McCluskey spent the day with the deceased at the deceased’s home. Some time during the morning the deceased bought speed that the two shared. At this stage the applicant was in his bedroom. After the deceased and Mr McCluskey had finished the speed, the applicant came out of the bedroom. He heard the deceased tell the applicant to move out. He said that the applicant “wasn’t saying or doing too much while I was there”. He helped the deceased to repair a doorbell. When he left the house, he heard the deceased again telling the applicant to leave.
	


Constable Alan Franklin


	
	Constable Franklin did not give evidence, but his statement in relation to the incident mentioned by Ms Crawford was read. On 20 May 2011 at 7.56pm he attended the street and spoke to the deceased. The deceased told him that he and a friend had had an argument that resulted in his friend hitting him in the back with a stick and chasing him down the street. He refused to give the friend’s identity and denied having any fears for his safety. At the constable’s request, the deceased lifted his shirt but the constable was unable to identify any marks or injuries.
	
	
	Also tendered was a CAD or COPS entry of Ms Crawford’s report to police and Constable Franklin’s report (exhibit D). The CAD identified the applicant as having assaulted the deceased over a “money issue”. The report stated that Constable Franklin spoke to the deceased and that the incident had been resolved before police arrived.
	


Stavan Vora


	
	Mr Vora gave evidence that he was employed by AGL and that on 26 May 2011 he had been door knocking, offering residents AGL products. At approximately 5.15pm he had attended the deceased’s home and had a conversation with him for 30 minutes. During the conversation, the deceased filled in paperwork for discounts in the name of Stacey Wells for his property and his sister’s property. He produced a keycard in the name of Stacey Wells. During this process, Mr Vora also made two verification calls to the company.
	
	
	While at the premises, Mr Vora saw two men inside and heard one of the men say goodbye to the deceased and go outside while the other remained inside. In cross-examination he agreed that he also heard noise coming from the garage.
	


Pastor Eddy Johnson


	
	Eddy Johnson was the applicant’s pastor and had known him for five or six years through ADRA (Adventist Development and Relief Agency). He was aware that the applicant attended counselling sessions through ADRA and he had delivered several food packages to him. He was aware that the applicant was a handyman and would collect scrap metal. In the months leading up to 26 May 2011 the applicant told him that he was looking for other accommodation because the deceased was gay.
	
	
	On 26 May 2011 at approximately 7.15pm he received a telephone call from the applicant who asked him to come over. During this conversation the applicant was difficult to understand as he was sobbing. Pastor Johnson picked up Mr Baker and Mr Taiper and went to the deceased’s home. When they arrived, there was no answer so Mr Baker called the applicant on the telephone. Some minutes later, the applicant approached them and the evidence of Pastor Johnson was as follows:
	


“A. Then I said, ""What's going on, what's happened Anthony"" because he was sobbing. He was incoherent to some extent and was not saying exactly and I said, ""Tell me what happened, Anthony, tell me what happened"". About that time we had moved away from the house. We had crossed the road and he said, ""I want to die, I want to die. Give me a rope, find me a rope"".

Q. Did you say anything about what had happened?

A. I said, ""Anthony talk to me, please tell me what happened."" Then he said - he came at me with a knife and slashed my arm. So I let go, I think because of the words he used and in the wrestling I stopped him”.

Q. Do you recall him saying anything else?

A. No and then he kept repeating, ""I want to die, I want to die"".

Q. Did you ask to see his arm?

A. Yes I did. I saw kind of blood on his sleeves and I said “Anthony let me

see what's there."" And he rolled up his sleeves and I could see a slash on his left arm and there was blood on the sleeves and yes, I did.

Q. Do you recall him saying anything else about what happened with the knife?

A. No, that's about just what he said, ""I stabbed him, I stabbed him"", but he was very distraught.” (T.192.34 – 193.9)


	
	Later Pastor Johnson said:
	


“Q. Pastor Johnson, I asked you a question about what Anthony said to you happened and you told the jury that he took a knife and slashed -

A. - slashed my arm.

Q. What else did Anthony tell you during that particular conversation?

A. Somehow I got the knife away from him and I took the knife and then I stabbed him.

Q. Can you recall anything else that he said to you during that particular conversation?

A. I'm not sure, and I didn't report that because I wasn't too sure, but there may have been something like we struggled a little bit, but I wasn't too sure at the time.” (T.196.9 - .21)


	
	Pastor Johnson was taken to the statement which he had made to the police and he was asked to read it to himself. He then gave the following evidence:
	


“Q. Does that refresh your memory as to the whole conversation?

A. Yes, I think it does, yes.

Q. Did he say anything else to you?

A. I don't recall anything specific.

Q. But what you have said in that particular sentence in your statement, do you notice there is something extra there that you didn't give in evidence?

A. ""I lost it"".

Q. Is that what he said?

A. Yes, ""I lost it"", yes.

Q. Just so we get it in context, if you could turn that statement over. We will mark that. Can you now perhaps try to put it in context that conversation that he used from the beginning?

A. I asked him, ""Talk to me, talk to me"" meaning what happened.

Q. Yes?

A. And he said he slashed my arm with a knife. ""I lost it then. I took the knife and I stabbed him”.” (T.197.12 - .32)


	
	Following this conversation, the group went to the next door neighbour’s house and the police were called. Pastor Johnson described the applicant as having his head in his hands and sobbing throughout this period. He said that when he spoke to the applicant he was distraught, incoherent and was sobbing.
	


Amos Baker


	
	Mr Baker said that he knew the applicant through a counselling group run by Pastor Johnson and was aware that he was a handyman and collected scrap metal. He said that he had dropped off a food parcel to the applicant on 24 May 2011 and at that time he had been in “great spirits”.
	
	
	On 26 May 2011 he attended the deceased’s address with Pastor Johnson and Mr Taiper at approximately 8pm. He was the first to reach the front door and noticed blood stains on the ground. He telephoned the applicant to let him know that they were outside. The applicant approached them from the road and had a conversation with Pastor Johnson before the four of them walked into the neighbour’s house from where police were called. Mr Baker said “We have to call the police” and the applicant had responded “We can ring the coppers there at a friend’s house”. Mr Baker said the applicant was sobbing and said words to the effect of “Get me a rope”. He also observed that the applicant had a towel wrapped around his forearm, although he did not see the injury itself.
	


Vidyanand Taiper


	
	Vidyanand Taiper said that he was a qualified nurse and knew the applicant through ADRA. On 26 May 2011 he attended the deceased’s home with Mr Baker and Pastor Johnson. When he saw the applicant, he examined his left arm noting a deep lacerated wound on his forearm.
	


Senior Constable Wal Michelotti


	
	Senior Constable Michelotti said that when he and Acting Sergeant Cook attended the neighbour’s house, the applicant was sitting with his head in his hands crying and with a towel wrapped around his arm. His evidence as to what then happened was:
	


“Q. Did you say: ""Anthony, what's going on""?

A. I did.

…

Q. Did Anthony mumble his words which you couldn't understand?

A. That's correct, he mumbled, yes. I asked him to repeat it.

Q. Did you say: ""Anthony, I don't understand what you are saying, stop crying and tell me again""?

A. Yes I did.

Q. And did the accused say: ""I stabbed my friend, I think I killed him""?

A. Yes he did.

Q. Did the accused start crying again?

A. Yes he did.

Q. Did you say: ""Anthony stop crying, and tell me again what happened""?

A. I did.

Q. Did the accused say: ""I had a fight with my friend. I was defending myself and I stabbed him""?

A. Yes he did.

Q. Did you say: ""What is your friend's name, and where is he now""?

A. Yes I did.

Q. And did the accused say: ""Dana is at our place""?

A. Yes he said that, yes.” (T.224.36 – 225.15)


	
	Senior Constable Michelotti and Acting Sergeant Cook then attended the deceased’s home and searched the premises. They located the deceased face up on the lounge.
	


Acting Sergeant Jason Cook


	
	He gave evidence that when he and Constable Michelotti saw the applicant he was crying, had his head in his hands and was mumbling and rocking. His forearms were wrapped in towels soaked in blood. Sergeant Cook’s evidence was:
	


“Q. Did Senior Constable Michelotti say to him ""stop crying and tell me what has happened""?

A. That is right we couldn't understand what he was saying so we were trying to settle him down.

Q. Did he say these words ""I killed my friend I stabbed him. He is up the road. I killed him. I stabbed him""?

A. Yeah something like that, yes.

Q. You eventually went to the premises …

Q. I want to you ask you some questions about the knife that you saw close to the body of the deceased. You saw that there was a person lying on a lounge face up?

A. Face up correct.

Q. And he had a blanket covering him?

A. There was a blanket covering him, yes.

Q. Do you recall seeing a blanket over the bottom half of his body with a knife on top of the blanket to the right hand side of the blanket?

A. That is right, yes. (T.231.36 – 232.32)

Matthew Holmes


	
	Matthew Holmes knew the applicant through the counselling group run at ADRA. On 26 May 2011 at 6.08pm, Mr Holmes telephoned the applicant. During this call the applicant sounded “really distressed”. He said “I’ve done something” and “What have I done”. The applicant did not detail why he was distressed and the decision was made to call Pastor Johnson. Mr Holmes called Pastor Johnson and requested that he attend the deceased’s home before calling the applicant back. Mr Holmes then attended the deceased’s home to speak to the applicant.
	
	
	When Mr Holmes arrived, the front door was open. He entered the house looking for the applicant and noticed drops of blood in the hallway and found the deceased lying in the lounge room covered by a blanket. He shook the deceased and put the blanket back on him and then left. He did not recall seeing the knife. As he left the house, the applicant approached him. Mr Holmes told the applicant that Pastor Johnson was on his way and the applicant agreed that he would call the police.
	


Shireen Doyle


	
	Ms Doyle was one of the ambulance officers who attended the scene. She confirmed that the deceased was dead and attended to the applicant. She concluded that the applicant was intoxicated, consistent with having been drinking and having taken two valiums. Both the applicant’s forearms had been bandaged with some fabric and required re-bandaging. Ms Doyle said that one of the cuts was quite deep but it had not caused any tendon damage, or anything that required micro surgery.
	


Jacqueline Borsato


	
	Ms Borsato was a member of the nursing staff at Blacktown Hospital Emergency Department. When she saw the applicant, he was on a trolley, curled up in a ball crying. Her evidence was:
	


“Q. Did you introduce yourself to him and say: ""Can you tell me why you are here""?

A. Yes.

Q. And did he say: ""My flatmate stabbed me""?

A. Yes.

Q. Did you say: ""Can you show me where""?

A. Yes.

Q. Did he roll up his sleeves, and could you see his arms were bandaged from the ambulance officers?

A. Yes.

Q. It was obvious to you that there was a wound to his left forearm and three to his right arm?

A. Yes.

Q. Did you ask him whether he had injuries to other parts of his body?

A. Yes.

Q. Did he say that there were none?

A. Yes, that's correct.

Q. Did he have a red mark on his left eye, and down his cheek?

A. Yes.

Q. Did that appear to be a recent injury?

A. Yeah.

Q. Did he have superficial scratch marks about his body, on his chest?

A. Yes.

Q. Could you say whether they appeared to be recent or not?

A. They looked recent, yeah.” (T.249.37 – 250.18)


	
	Ms Borsato was asked to read out what she had written at the time of the applicant’s admission:
	


“A. Patient brought in by ambulance in police custody with one deep laceration to the left arm, three superficial cuts to the right arm, superficial scratch marks to his arms after alleged assault with flatmate. Patient states wounds were from flatmate stabbing him with a knife. Patient denies loss of consciousness GCS15. Patient is calm and cooperative. Patient distressed and crying. Patient states having a sore neck. Patient has red bruising on left eyelid and down left cheek under eye.” (T.253.5 - .11)

The applicant told her that he had taken a valium tablet after the incident.

Constable Tim Hansell


	
	Constable Hansell attended Blacktown Hospital with the applicant and remained with him as he received treatment before escorting him to St Marys Police Station. On the journey to the hospital, the applicant was curled up on the ambulance stretcher crying. When asked by the admitting nurse “What happened tonight?”, the applicant said “Got in a fight”. He observed that when the doctors examined the wounds to his arms, it caused the applicant a great deal of pain.
	


Senior Constable Darren Booth


	
	Senior Constable Booth said that he attended the deceased’s home on 26 May 2011 and spoke to the applicant:
	


“Q. Did you say ""I'm going to ask you some questions about what happened down the road. I am Senior Constable Booth and this is Senior Constable Krauce. We are from Blacktown Police""?

A. Yes I did.

Q. Did the accused say: ""I was just sitting in my room and they were outside shooting up and he came at me and cut me and I grabbed the knife and stabbed him""?

A. Yes he did.

Q. Did you say, ""You do not have to say or do anything you do not want to, do you understand"" - did he say ""yes, yes I'm so sorry""?

A. Yes he did.

Q. Was he then placed under arrest?

A. Yes he was.” (T.260.32 - .47)

Constable Mathew Krauce


	
	Constable Krauce took several photographs of the applicant’s arms at the deceased’s home. He gave this evidence:
	


“Q. Constable, outside the premises at number 15, did you hear Mr James say: ""I was just sitting in my room and they were outside shooting up and he came at me and he cut me and I grabbed him and stabbed him I am so sorry""?

A. Yes.

Q. And then did Senior Constable Booth caution?

A. He did the first part and then I did the second.

Q. All right, did he then say, Mr James then say ""yes yes I'm so sorry""?

A. Yes.” (T.263.42)

Senior Constable Bradley Jorgenson


	
	Senior Constable Jorgenson conducted a search of the deceased’s premises. During the search he located a handwritten note in the bedroom, addressed to the applicant which read as follows:
	


“Tony,

I’m tired of you kicking me in the teeth all the time, I’ve told you before that if you and [Kelly or Kerry] get back together I want you to move out. Stop lyeing [sic] to me and to yourself. She only wants you ‘cause your [sic] getting that money when it’s all gone you’ll be back[?]”

Detective Senior Constable Scott-Mahjet


	
	Detective Senior Constable Scott-Mahjet was the officer in charge of this matter. The applicant’s interview was played during Detective Sergeant Constable Scott-Mahjet’s evidence. Throughout the ERISP the applicant can be heard crying and is very distressed. When the transcript records “no audible reply”, the applicant can be heard sobbing.
	
	
	Through Detective Scott-Mahjet a summary of the DNA findings was tendered (exhibit J). Profiles matching the DNA profiles of both the applicant and the deceased were found on the knife taken from the blanket covering the deceased in the lounge room. Detective Scott-Mahjet was able to confirm that the 000 call was made by the neighbour at 8.16pm. Through him a record of an SMS sent from a pay phone to the applicant on 20 May 2011 at 1pm was tendered and became exhibit L. It read:
	


“YOU HAVE UNTILL 2PM TO GET My money 2me my family chucks your things on the road dale”


	
	Detective Scott-Mahjet agreed that the note found in the deceased’s room had not been forensically tested and that he was unable to say whether the applicant had seen the note. He agreed that when taken to the interview room at the police station, the applicant “lay down on his hands, face down” and did not look up or make any answers to the police questions.
	


The applicant’s ERISP


	
	This was played to the court during the hearing of the appeal and I have subsequently listened to it on two occasions. I have concluded that the manner in which the applicant answered questions supports the observation of witnesses at trial to the effect that he was genuinely very upset and distraught over the death of the deceased. The interview commenced at 9.10pm on 26 May 2011.
	
	
	The relevant parts of the interview are as follows:
	


“Q13   All right. And what was it that you told them when they asked you

what happened?

A.   There's a. We had a fight.

Q14   Who had a fight?

Q60   All right. Now the, the knife that you used to stab Dale, was

A   Yeah.

Q62   Do you know where Dale got it from?

A   It was in, it was in the house.

Q103   Yep. O.K. Now what was it that you were trying to do by trying to get

dead?

A    He started bleeding from the mouth and I was shaking him, Dale,

what's happening. He wasn't moving.”

Dr Shamim Farooq


	
	Dr Farooq did not give evidence but his statement was read. He was the treating doctor at Blacktown Hospital, who examined the applicant. He noted three lacerations to the right forearm that required stitches, and one laceration to the left forearm that required stitches and complaints of neck pain. Dr Farooq said that he was unable to obtain a history from the applicant because he was “in shock and too distressed”.
	


Dr Riane Van Vuuren


	
	Dr Van Vuuren was the forensic pathologist who conducted the post-mortem examination of the deceased. She determined that the cause of death was a single stab wound to the left posterior lateral aspect of the chest and that moderate to severe force would have been required to inflict the wound. She agreed that swinging the knife around in a sideways action could be consistent with the wound and that it was possible that the deceased’s arm was raised at the time the wound was inflicted.
	
	
	In addition to the stab wound to the chest, Dr Van Vuuren observed that the hyoid bone was fractured and that there was a small contusion over the fracture. She said that this injury is usually caused by manual strangulation and said that moderate to severe force would be required to inflict it. She said that a contusion was like a bruise. She could not rule out the possibility that this injury occurred as a result of squeezing and pushing in a defensive action.
	
	
	Her evidence on this issue under cross examination was:
	


“Q. But again I put a proposition to you, or an action to you, could you tell me whether or not you agree or disagree about the likelihood of the injuries having occurred in that manner?

A. Okay.

Q. My left arm out, because these are injuries to the right side of the deceased. Assume for a minute that the accused has a knife in his right hand?

A. Yes.

Q. And his left arm is free. If his left arm is out, if he were to grab the deceased underneath the chin --

A. Mmm.

Q. -- and push or squeeze. So I am talking about an action where my hand is outstretched, the palm is open, and the thumb and the index fingers are splayed out if you like, or at their widest?

A. Yeah.

Q. And grabbed the neck of the deceased, or even grabbed the neck and the clavicle, the area between your shoulder and the neck?

A. The clavicle is the bone.

Q. What is the stringy bit in between?

A. We call it that the super clavicle area.

Q. Grabbing around the neck first and squeezing and/or pushing, could that explain some of the injuries that you saw?

A. The squeezing would more account for the injuries, not the pushing.

Q. There could have been squeezing and pushing?

A. Yes.

Q. And you cannot rule out the possibility that if the injury occurred in the manner I suggested with the arm out and the fingers are under the neck and the hand under the neck, you cannot rule out the possibility that that occurred in a that defensive motion or defensive action, can you?

A. No, you cannot.

Q. Indeed, I think you said a few moments ago, or you volunteered a few moments ago, the observation that it is unlikely, very unlikely, that the deceased and the accused would have been standing still during the struggle?

A. Yes.

Q. And I respectfully suggest that it is highly likely that they were exerting pressure on perhaps - sorry, that it is likely that they were moving around either forward to back or side to side, when these injuries occurred?

A. That's right.

Q. Do you agree with this as a general proposition; I think you said the hyoid bone it is a small bone above the Adam's apple?

A. Yes.

Q. The bone calcifies as you get older?

A. Yes, it does.

Q. So it is easier to injure that as you get older?

A. It is easier to break it, yes.” (T.318.19 – 319.41)


	
	Dr Van Vuuren observed other injuries on the deceased comprising superficial injuries to the left palm, thumb and index finger which she said were consistent with self defence wounds. There was a 3mm abrasion under the jaw, a cut on the lip and nose and an abrasion above the left eyelid. She said that also present on the deceased’s body were both recent and old injection marks and that during the post-mortem examination, she observed changes in the body consistent with intravenous drug use. She said that the methylamphetamine level found in the deceased was potentially toxic.
	


Dr Judith Perl


	
	Dr Perl was the forensic pharmacologist who analysed the findings at post-mortem in relation to drugs. Present in the deceased’s blood was amphetamine at .003 mg/l, methylamphetamine at .24 mg/l, seven-aminoxlonazepam .07 mg/l and delta-9-THC. Dr Perl said that the level of methylamphetamine was in the toxic range and was consistent with the deceased having used the drug that day. She said that the methylamphetamine was partly metabolised which requires the consumption of methylamphetamine at least two to four hours before his death. She was not able to comment on the level of intoxication from the blood reading alone.
	
	
	Dr Perl described the various stages of the effects of methylamphetamine. She could not rule out the possibility that the deceased had had more than one dose of methylamphetamine. Based on Mr McCluskey’s statement, if the use of methylamphetamine had occurred around midday, the deceased would have been past his peak level of intoxication and would have been commencing his withdrawal stage. If, however, the deceased’s use was later in the afternoon, he may have been at around his peak level of intoxication at the time of his death. With such a high methylamphetamine concentration, it was possible that the deceased would have been displaying argumentative and possibly aggressive behaviours.
	
	
	Dr Perl gave evidence concerning the intoxication of the applicant based on samples taken on 27 May 2011. The applicant’s samples contained .03 mg/l methylamphetamine, the bi-products of valium and anti-depressants and a low level (.01 mg/l) delta-9-THC. Based on the level of methylamphetamine in his system and the ERISP, Dr Perl did not expect the applicant to have had any significant impairment of his cognitive function at the time of the incident.
	


Alan Jones


	
	The deceased’s next door neighbour, Alan Jones, did not give evidence but his interview with police was played and the transcript became MFI 18. He knew the applicant quite well and the deceased as an acquaintance. The applicant used to mow the lawn and assist him and his brother with the car. The applicant did not have a good relationship with the deceased, due to friction over money, and he had wanted to move out of the property. He recounted an incident when he saw the deceased throw “a hunk of timber” at the applicant while the applicant was working on his van at the Jones house. On 26 May 2011 the applicant had been working on a car for him. He returned to his house promising to return. That evening the applicant returned to the Jones house shaking and crying and asked him to call Pastor Johnson. When asked what had happened, the applicant told him “I’ve hurt Dale”. Mr Jones saw a cut on the applicant’s arm. When Pastor Johnson arrived, he told Mr Jones to ring the police and Mr Jones rang 000. In that call he said “Tony’s murdered someone”.
	


Robert Jones


	
	Robert Jones is the brother of Alan Jones. He did not give evidence but his interview with police was played and the transcript became MFI 19. He had known the applicant for approximately 30 years and had met the deceased a couple of times. He recounted an occasion when the applicant had been working on the car in the Jones’ driveway when the deceased “picked up a stick and well about six foot long, seven foot long, threw it at Tony”. He said that he had seen the deceased “have a go at him out the front twice”.
	
	
	On 26 May 2011 the applicant had been working on the car in the Jones’ driveway and had left at approximately 5pm. When the applicant returned to the Jones’ house, he was asleep and woke up to his brother speaking to the applicant. He had never seen the applicant so upset. He noticed that the applicant had a bloodied bandage around his arm.
	
	
	Exhibit F comprised coloured photographs of the applicant’s arms, taken on the night of the incident. The left arm shows a very large and deep cut. The right arm shows three cuts which are deep but not as deep or as long as that on the left arm. There are also other smaller scratches on the right arm.
	


THE APPEAL

Ground 1 – The verdict was unreasonable and cannot be supported having regard to the evidence.


	
	In his submissions, the applicant divided the evidence into four categories. The following is a summary of the submissions made in relation to each of those categories.
	


The relationship evidence


	
	The relationship between the applicant and the deceased was a volatile one. There was evidence, mainly based on hearsay complaints by the deceased to others, especially his family, that the applicant had been violent towards him. There was only limited evidence from witnesses who had actually seen the applicant act violently towards the deceased.
	
	
	There was evidence that the deceased had acted violently towards the applicant. Peter Rofe gave evidence of seeing the deceased chase the applicant around a car with a piece of wood and the Jones brothers witnessed conduct to similar effect. There was evidence of the deceased chasing a man, who loosely resembled the applicant, down the street with a Samurai sword or a machete (evidence of Blake Pardey, Julie Pardey and Kirralee Howley). This observation was made only two days before the incident. Given the evidence as to the deceased having a ponytail, it is difficult to imagine who the person being pursued could be other than the applicant. Ms Pardey recalled the man she had seen pursued by the person with the ponytail was the same person she had previously seen looking at scrap metal in a truck. There was evidence from a number of witnesses that the applicant had an interest in scrap metal.
	
	
	There was evidence that the deceased was asking the applicant to move out. There was some ambivalence in this evidence, particularly in the light of the letter found in the deceased’s bedroom (exhibit G). The suggestion in that letter was that the deceased was hopeful of the relationship with the applicant continuing. There was evidence that the deceased was very angry with the applicant on the day that he was killed. Sandra Crawford said that she had never seen him so angry as on that night.
	


The deceased’s amphetamine use


	
	The deceased had a high level of methylamphetamine in his blood at the time he died. Dr Perl agreed that at such a high methylamphetamine level, it was possible that the deceased would be displaying argumentative and possibly aggressive behaviour. There was no evidence at trial that the applicant had consumed amphetamine that day.
	


The deceased’s and the applicant’s injuries


	
	The deceased had a broken hyoid bone, which was consistent with manual strangulation. In cross-examination Dr Van Vuuren could not rule out the possibility that this injury occurred as a result of the applicant using his left hand to hold and squeeze the deceased’s neck while he was attempting to fend off the deceased with his right hand or, had the knife in his right hand.
	
	
	Dr Van Vuuren’s opinion was that the direct cause of death was a single stab wound to the left posterior side of the chest. The deceased’s other injuries were described as “superficial”. The injuries to the deceased should not be considered in isolation, but in the context of the injuries to the applicant. The wounds to the applicant’s arms, in particular the left arm, could not be described as superficial. There was no suggestion that they were self inflicted, nor could there be.
	
	
	The injuries to the deceased and the applicant did not support the Crown scenario that the applicant attacked the deceased, that the deceased had slashed out at him with the knife and that the applicant had wrestled the knife from him and stabbed him. Not only was there no evidence to support this hypothesis, there were some obvious difficulties with it. The injuries to the deceased, leaving aside the fatal stab wound, were quite limited. The applicant posed the question “If he was the aggressor and was strangling the deceased in the lounge room, how did the deceased get access to a knife?” More consistent with the physical evidence and the pattern of injuries to the applicant and the deceased was that the deceased had attacked the applicant with a knife, which he had brought with him into the lounge room, probably from the kitchen. The deceased inflicted injuries to the applicant’s arms as the applicant attempted to ward off the blows. The applicant managed to wrestle the knife from him and in the course of what in effect was a life and death struggle, he inflicted a single knife wound to the applicant which was fatal. In the course of that struggle, the applicant had grabbed the deceased around the neck with his left hand fracturing the hyoid bone.
	


The applicant’s account


	
	The preceding hypothesis is essentially what the applicant said to those persons to whom he spoke on the night of the incident and in his ERISP, i.e. the deceased had attacked him with a knife, that he had no intention of injuring or killing the deceased but was simply acting to protect himself.
	


Crown submissions


	
	The following is a summary of the submissions by the Crown.
	
	
	The effect of the relationship evidence was that over a long period of time, the applicant had acted violently towards the deceased. The deceased wanted the applicant to leave his home but the applicant was unwilling to do so. On the day of the incident, these matters had come to a head. The relationship evidence showed that the applicant was not only capable of acting violently towards the deceased but had done so.
	
	
	The injuries suffered by the deceased supported the Crown case. A single stab wound to the left back side of the chest, which required “moderate to severe force” to inflict, was not consistent with the applicant just trying to get the deceased away from him and was more consistent with a deliberate swinging of the knife with an intention to injure the deceased.
	
	
	The Crown relied upon the fracture of the hyoid bone on the right side of the deceased’s neck. Dr Van Vuuren said that normally a fracture to the hyoid bone is occasioned by manual strangulation because the bone is protected by other tissue. She did not agree that a simple pushing action would be sufficient to cause such a fracture. There were other superficial injuries to the palm of the left hand of the deceased, consistent with defence wounds. This was indicative of the deceased grabbing at the knife trying to deflect it from his body. The Crown submitted that these injuries were not consistent with the version given by the applicant in his ERISP.
	
	
	The applicant was unable to explain why he waited approximately two hours before the police were contacted. He said nothing about trying to render assistance to the deceased. The DNA evidence in the house showed that the applicant must have at least gone into the bathroom after the killing and before the police arrived. It was not the applicant who contacted the police, but other people.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the applicant gave a number of accounts of his version of events after the death, which were not consistent. The Crown relied upon the evidence of Pastor Johnson that when he asked the applicant what had happened, he was told “I lost it then. I took the knife and I stabbed him”. The Crown submitted that the distress of the applicant, which was observed following the incident, was not inconsistent with an intention to inflict serious bodily harm upon the deceased. The Crown submitted that the distress was equally consistent with the applicant realising the consequences of his actions and likely punishment.
	
	
	The Crown relied upon the following topics in order to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant intended to inflict grievous bodily harm when he stabbed the deceased and to negate self defence beyond reasonable doubt. These were the relationship evidence, the fact that the applicant had a “black belt”, the recreational drug use, that the deceased wanted the applicant to move out, that the applicant had brought a knife into the house when he moved in, the details of the machete/Samurai sword incident, the events on 26 May 2011 before the killing, the events after the killing, the versions given by the applicant, the post-mortem evidence and the evidence of Dr Perl. The Crown particularly noted that the version of events in the ERISP had not been tested by cross-examination or otherwise.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that there were a number of good reasons why the jury would not have accepted the truthfulness of what the applicant said in his ERISP. The applicant’s statement that he was the one who wanted to move out was inconsistent with the deceased’s complaints about him not moving out and the evidence of family members concerning their attempts to eject him. The Crown relied upon exhibit G (the letter found in the applicant’s bedroom) which in its terms told the applicant to leave the premises. The Crown relied upon the denial by the applicant of any homosexual relationship with the deceased, which was clearly false. His stated disapproval of the deceased’s drug use was inconsistent with the evidence that both he and the deceased were drug takers and with his blood test results.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that there was an inherent implausibility in the account given by the applicant of what happened. The Crown submitted that had the applicant been attacked by the deceased wielding a knife, he would not have remained still or inactive while the deceased slashed his arms. The Crown submitted that such a version would be difficult for a jury to accept, i.e. that a person would stand still while being repeatedly slashed with a knife. This was particularly so when he was reported as having told people that he was black belt qualified in karate.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the alternative theory as to what occurred put forward by the applicant was clearly not accepted by the jury. The Crown case in its turn relied upon the nature of the injury, the strength required to inflict it, its location and the weapon used, to establish beyond reasonable doubt that the act of stabbing the deceased was done with an intention to inflict grievous bodily harm. The Crown relied upon, inter alia, the relationship evidence, the relative size and weight as between the deceased and the applicant, and the fact that the applicant had disarmed the deceased before his death, to establish beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant did not act in self defence. The Crown submitted that the jury was not bound to accept the applicant’s version of events in his interview with police and that there was a proper basis for the jury to reject his version.
	


Consideration


	
	The question for this Court is whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant was guilty of murder. This is a question of fact. In considering this ground, the Court must undertake its own assessment of the sufficiency and quality of the evidence. In M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; 181 CLR 487 the plurality (Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ) said:
	


“7   Where, notwithstanding that as a matter of law there is evidence

to sustain a verdict, a court of criminal appeal is asked to conclude

that the verdict is unsafe or unsatisfactory, the question which the

court must ask itself is whether it thinks that upon the whole of the

evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable

doubt that the accused was guilty. But in answering that question the court must not disregard or discount either the consideration that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, or the consideration that the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses.”


	
	This test has been restated to reflect the terms of s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 in MFA v R [2001] HCA 53; 213 CLR 606 at [58]. McHugh, Kirby and Gummow JJ said that the reference to “unsafe or unsatisfactory” in M v The Queen is to be taken as “equivalent to the statutory formula referring to the impugned verdict as “unreasonable” or such as “cannot be supported having regard to the evidence”. These principles were more recently re-affirmed by the majority of the High Court in SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; 243 CLR 400.
	
	
	For the reasons which follow, I have concluded that upon the whole of the evidence it was not open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant was guilty of murder.
	
	
	The relationship evidence did not establish that the applicant had a propensity to act violently towards the deceased. Rather, it established that the relationship between them was volatile and had resulted in physical violence being directed by each of them against the other. The effect of the relationship evidence was that the deceased was just as likely to act violently towards the applicant as the applicant would towards the deceased.
	
	
	There was undoubtedly a body of evidence to the effect that the deceased told members of his family and Mr McCluskey that he wished the applicant to leave his home. The balance of the evidence on this subject is at best equivocal. Despite the actions of the deceased’s family, following the night of the cocktail party, the applicant was still residing in the home at the time of the incident. Of particular significance is the deceased’s letter, exhibit G. Regardless of whether that letter was ever read by the applicant, it highlights the ambivalent nature of the deceased’s feelings towards the applicant. At one level the letter was telling the applicant to leave the premises and at another, it expressed an expectation that having discovered his wife’s duplicity, the applicant would return. In my opinion the relationship evidence, while providing support for the Crown case, provides equal support for the applicant’s description of what occurred.
	
	
	The pharmacological evidence from Dr Perl does not assist the Crown case. It makes clear that the deceased had consumed a substantial quantity of methylamphetamine during the day which had the potential to give rise to argumentative and possibly aggressive behaviours. The observations of Stavan Vora on the day of the incident supports other persons besides the applicant being in the deceased’s house during the afternoon of 26 May, which is consistent with the applicant’s description of the deceased’s drug taking. There is the evidence of Ms Crawford as to the deceased’s enraged state when she saw him on the afternoon of 26 May.
	
	
	These matters favour the version of events given by the applicant, rather than the Crown case theory.
	
	
	The Crown’s criticism of the applicant’s ERISP does not withstand scrutiny. The applicant’s disapproval of the deceased’s drug taking is not surprising in circumstances when he was making a statement to the police. His denial of being “gay” is equally understandable. While in many areas of society such an admission is common place, it regrettably continues to be the case that for many people such a circumstance constitutes a stigma and is a source of prejudice.
	
	
	I have already commented about the ambivalent nature of the deceased’s relationship with the applicant. Given the content of exhibit G, which refers to the applicant returning to his wife, it may well have been the case that by 26 May it was the applicant who intended to leave the premises, rather than the deceased wishing to eject him.
	
	
	The Crown’s submission as to the “inherent implausibility’ of the applicant’s version of events is not made out. If the applicant were suddenly and unexpectedly attacked by the deceased wielding a knife, there would be an initial reaction of shock and disbelief during which wounds could be sustained before the applicant initiated a response. When one keeps in mind that this was a dynamic event with actions occurring rapidly in the course of a violent struggle, there is no inherent improbability in the applicant’s assertion that there was an initial period of shock and surprise before he responded to the attack.
	
	
	Similarly, the delay between the death of the deceased and contacting the authorities is explained by the highly emotional reaction by the applicant to what had occurred. One gains an insight into the depth of that emotional distress when one listens to the ERISP. It is not unreasonable to accept that for a period of time following the deceased’s death, the applicant was so overwhelmed as to be incapable of acting logically. It should be kept in mind that far from seeking to hide what had happened, the applicant contacted Alan Jones and his pastor and sought guidance and advice. It is also not without significance that everyone including police officers, who had any contact with the applicant in the hours following the deceased’s death, commented on how distraught he was and on his inability in some cases to communicate. I am not persuaded that what happened in the hours following the deceased’s death should be given a sinister connotation, rather than the equally plausible, if not more likely explanation, that the applicant was so grief stricken by what had happened that he was unable to think clearly and was seeking assistance and moral support from his religious advisor.
	
	
	In its submissions the Crown relied upon what it described as discrepancies in the various descriptions given by the applicant of the circumstances of the deceased’s death. To the extent that there are discrepancies, they are minor. There is otherwise a remarkable consistency in what the applicant said in answer to the question which was frequently put to him, i.e. “what happened”. He consistently said that the deceased had unexpectedly attacked him with a knife and that he had defended himself. I do not see that the use of the phrase “I lost it” when he spoke to Pastor Johnson gives rise to a discrepancy or places any doubt on that fundamental proposition. The phrase is at best ambiguous in its meaning. It could mean he lost control (such as occurs in the defence of provocation) or that in the course of the struggle with or for the knife, he inadvertently stabbed the deceased.
	
	
	The evidence which causes me most concern in relation to the applicant’s conviction for murder is that relating to the injuries suffered by the deceased and him. There is no evidence to support the proposition put to the jury at trial that it was the applicant who was the aggressor and who attacked the deceased. The genesis of that scenario seems to be the fracture of the hyoid bone on the right side of the deceased’s neck. In that scenario, the applicant is said to have been in the process of throttling the deceased when the deceased retaliated by stabbing at him with a knife.
	
	
	Apart from this involving speculation rather than inference, the scenario fails to explain how the deceased could have gained access to a knife if, as the Crown submitted, the attack took place in the lounge room. The problem with this scenario was appreciated by the Crown during the running of the appeal.
	
	
	The alternative scenario put in the appeal was that the deceased had attacked the applicant with a knife, there was a struggle during the course of which the applicant disarmed the deceased and then no longer being at risk himself had proceeded to stab the deceased with the intent to inflict grievous bodily harm. What that scenario fails to take into account is the violent nature of the struggle which must have occurred, in the course of which the applicant received the deep wounds to his arms, the deceased’s hyoid bone was fractured and the applicant received superficial scratch marks to his chest and a sore neck and the deceased received superficial injuries to his left palm, thumb and index finger. During the course of that struggle, which appears to have happened very quickly, the applicant was able to take the knife from the deceased and stabbed him with it.
	
	
	On that latter scenario in which the deceased was the aggressor armed with a knife, it is difficult to see how on the available evidence the offence of murder could possibly be made out to the necessary standard, i.e. beyond reasonable doubt. The hypothesis consistent with the applicant not being guilty of murder is that the stabbing of the deceased occurred in the course of a violent struggle in which the applicant was seeking to defend himself. That hypothesis has not been negatived by the Crown.
	
	
	As was said in M v The Queen (Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ) at [9]:
	


“9   … In most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court

will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced. It is only

where a jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is

capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a court of criminal

appeal that the court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice

occurred.”


	
	In this case, except for what happened at the time when the deceased was killed, there were few issues which required evaluation by the jury. The evidence was relatively straightforward and uncontroversial. The crucial evidence was the medical evidence as to the injuries sustained by the two protagonists. There was nothing controversial about that evidence. The only controversy was the inferences capable of being drawn from it. The jury was in no better position than this Court to assess that evidence. In this case the inference of murder, drawn by the jury as a finding beyond reasonable doubt, was not open to it.
	


Conclusion


	
	It follows that the verdict of guilty of murder cannot stand. This is not the sort of case where the matter should be referred for a retrial for the offence of murder. The Crown case will never improve and the evidence available cannot support a verdict of guilty for that offence. In those circumstances, the conviction for the offence of murder should be quashed and a verdict of acquittal of that offence should be entered. That, however, does not end the matter. There is sufficient evidence, in my opinion, to support on a retrial a conviction for the offence of manslaughter, based on excessive self defence.
	
	
	The question then arises as to what order this Court should make. The relevant provision is s 8(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. The application of that section in a context similar to this was considered by this Court in R v PL [2009] NSWCCA 256 where Spigelman CJ (McClellan CJ at CL and R A Hulme J agreeing) held that in circumstances where the Crown case for murder was exceptionally weak so that on a retrial for the offence of murder, an appeal from a conviction would be upheld, an unqualified order for a retrial should not be made. The Court held that in such circumstances it was appropriate to order a retrial but that such a retrial should be restricted to the offence of manslaughter. That is the order which I consider is appropriate in this case.
	
	
	In view of that conclusion, it is not necessary to consider Ground of Appeal 1A nor the applications for leave to appeal against sentence.
	
	
	The orders which I propose are as follows:
	



	
	In relation to the application for leave to appeal against conviction, leave to appeal is granted and the appeal is allowed.
	
	
	The verdict of guilty of murder is quashed and an acquittal on the charge of murder is entered.
	
	
	There should be a new trial limited to the charge of manslaughter.
	



	
	HALL J: The applicant was charged on indictment that on 26 May 2011 at Doonside he did murder Dana Lomas: s 18(1)(a) Crimes Act 1900. The applicant entered a not guilty plea on 24 June 2013. He was tried by judge and a jury of 12 between 24 June and 9 July 2013. Dana Lomas was also known as “Dale” Lomas.
	
	
	On 9 July 2013, the jury returned a guilty verdict. The applicant was sentenced on 25 October 2013 to a term of imprisonment with a non-parole period of 16 years commencing on 9 December 2012 and expiring on 8 December 2028 with a balance of term of 5 years to expire on 8 December 2033.
	
	
	On 13 October 2014, a Notice of Appeal or Notice of Application for Leave to Appeal was filed. The Notice contained the following three grounds of appeal:
	


1.   The verdict was unreasonable and cannot be supported having regard to the evidence.

2   Her honour erred in not taking into account the appellant’s onerous bail conditions for 18 months, which were akin to house arrest.

3.   The sentence was manifestly excessive.


	
	At the hearing before this Court on 24 April 2015, the Notice was, by leave, amended to plead the following additional ground:
	


Ground 1A: Her Honour the learned trial judge erred in not leaving provocation as a partial defence to the jury.


	
	In the Crown case at trial a number of lay witnesses, police witnesses and two expert witnesses were called to give evidence, the lastmentioned being Dr Van Vuuren, Forensic Pathologist and Dr Judith Perl, Forensic Pharmacologist.
	
	
	The applicant did not give evidence at trial. He was interviewed by police on 26 May 2011. The ERISP in relation thereto was tendered at the trial (Exhibit H).
	


Background


	
	The deceased (who was 41 years of age at the time of his death) and the applicant had shared a duplex together at an address in Doonside (“the Doonside premises”). The applicant moved into the premises shortly after the deceased’s birthday in May 2010.
	
	
	Evidence called by the Crown from a number of witnesses established that the relationship between the applicant and the deceased had been, at times, a volatile one. However, with the exception of some relatively minor assaults, there was no evidence of any violent assaults having occurred which resulted in very serious physical harm to either one of them. Members of the deceased’s family and other witnesses gave evidence to the effect that they had seen marks, bruises or other signs on the deceased which on the basis of hearsay evidence was attributed to him having been struck by the applicant.
	
	
	The deceased had a drug taking habit up to the time of his death. There was evidence of him having ingested prohibited drugs on the day of his death. The applicant had also consumed drugs from time to time.
	
	
	There were no witnesses to the stabbing of the deceased by the accused on 26 May 2011, which occurred at the Doonside premises. The applicant when interviewed admitted to police, and gave a history to hospital personnel after the stabbing incident, of having stabbed the deceased.
	
	
	His defence at trial was one of self-defence. No other defence was raised. As discussed below, the alternative of manslaughter was left to the jury on two specific bases.
	


Relationship Evidence


	
	The applicant’s written submissions contained a summary of the evidence constituting the Crown case, including the evidence as to “relationship” of a number of witnesses to whom I have referred above. The latter was in the nature of background and context evidence of the relationship between the deceased and the applicant which included instances of domestic violence and arguments. Some of the evidence indicated an ambivalent and in certain respects a contradictory attitude by the deceased towards the applicant. Despite the turbulent relationship, with instances of assault said to have been committed by the applicant, there was evidence that the deceased still professed love for him.
	
	
	The deceased’s sister, Bella Winikerei and her partner were living in the abovementioned Doonside premises with the deceased when the applicant (who she referred to in evidence as “Tony”) moved in. Ms Winikerei said when the applicant moved in he brought with him, along with other possessions, a knife with a brown handle: T 81. She described it as in the shape of a machete “but a smaller version”: T 81. Sometime later she said she saw it in the kitchen. She drew a sketch of it which was admitted at the trial (Exhibit B).
	
	
	During the period she lived in the Doonside premises up until October 2010, she said she heard the deceased, Dale, and Tony arguing at times. She said on those occasions Tony would be swearing at Dale in an abusive manner and in an angry voice: T 82. When asked “Did Tony tell you anything about these arguments with Dale?” she answered “He just said he loves him”: T 83.
	
	
	She said that after she moved out of the Doonside premises she lived close by and would see the deceased most days. In November 2010 she said she saw that he had scratches and bruises to his face on one occasion: T 84. She said the deceased said “Tony did it” referring to those marks. He was crying. She said he was sore, in pain: T 84.
	
	
	Later in the same year, she said she saw her brother, the deceased, on an occasion on which he said to her that he was in pain. She lifted his shirt and said “he was bruised”: T 85. There was a bruise on his back which looked like a welt. She described it as big and black: T 85. She said that he told her Tony had hit him: T 83. She said she saw an injury, a bruise, on his chest.
	
	
	She said there was another occasion when her brother had burns on his arms and his hands: T 86. She said that he told her “Tony put a cigarette out on me”: T 86.
	
	
	Ms Winikerei gave evidence about a cocktail party in 2011. She said that her brother left the party at about 2:20am and returned at about 3:30am. She asked what he was doing coming back. He said: “The f’ing C chased me down the road with a knife out of my own home”: T 87.
	
	
	She said about a week before Tony’s birthday in May 2011, he said he had given Tony seven days to move out: T 88.
	
	
	Eileen Winikerei, the niece of the deceased, gave evidence that the deceased had told her that Tony was a black belt and that he was scared of him: T 99. She referred to the events of the same cocktail party in 2011 described by her mother, Bella Winikerei. The cocktail party was at her house and was to celebrate her birthday. She gave evidence that the deceased had been at the party and had left before returning in the early hours of the next morning and that he was ‘crying and hysterical’ and had said that ‘Tony had chased him out of his own home with a knife’: T 100.
	
	
	She gave evidence that the next day she, her mother and a friend had gone to the deceased’s house and her mother had told the accused to ‘get out’: T 101. She said that the deceased had told her that he was scared of the accused ‘because if there was no food or no sugar and coffee and stuff he would cop it from him’: T 102.
	
	
	Ms Winikerei gave evidence that on 22 May 2011 the deceased went to her house and showed her bruising on his back in a diagonal line which she indicated was about 20cm long: T 102. She said the deceased told her the accused had ‘struck him with something’ and that he was crying at the time: T 103. She said in cross-examination that she had never seen the accused injure the deceased: T 104.
	
	
	Sandra Crawford lived in the same street as the Doonside premises and she knew the deceased. She said that for a couple of months (later changed to four or five months: T 111) after the applicant moved in with the deceased “they were very happy” and then things went downhill: T 110.
	
	
	She said on one occasion she saw the deceased crying. He would tell her how Tony used to abuse him and physically hurt him: T 111. He told her of an occasion when Tony held a knife to the deceased’s throat and threatened to cut his throat: T 111.
	
	
	She gave evidence of an occasion when she saw Tony with a bed slat. He went to hit the deceased once, which missed, but she said she saw he hit him a second and third time, on his back: T 112.
	
	
	A few minutes later she saw the deceased, Dale, walk past with a pole in his hands, but he did not do anything with it. He was crying. She rang the police. She said it took seven hours for the police to come. In the meantime Dale asked her to “cancel” the police but she refused: T 113. She said Dale showed her his back – a deep imprint was on his back “where you could see it got him twice”; a reference to the bed slat: T 114.
	
	
	She last saw the deceased at about 5:00pm on 26 May 2011. He mentioned “how he told Tony that he had to be out by Tuesday”: T 115.
	
	
	Mr Peter Rofe lived about 30 metres away from the house where “Dale and Tony” lived: T 121. As at 2011 he had known Tony for about five years.
	
	
	He gave evidence that on about 20 May 2011, he saw the applicant working on his van next door to his place. He saw Dale approach him. Dale was yelling and screaming. He said he saw them arguing. Dale said something to the effect of “I want you out of my house, I want you to leave”: T 122. He said Tony was not aggressive “he was just dodging him. Dale had a piece of wood ... At one stage he pursued Tony and they ran around the van twice”: T 122-3. Dale threw the stick at Tony but he did not hit anyone: T 123. He said that Dale then walked back away.
	
	
	Mr Rofe said he saw Tony the day Dale died. The last time he saw him was about 2:30 to 3:00pm that day: T 124.
	
	
	In cross-examination, he agreed he told police the applicant appeared to be normal, nothing out of the ordinary: T 128. He told them he was in good spirits and had been doing manual work on his car: T 128.
	
	
	Ms Julie Pardey gave evidence that at 3:00pm on 24 May 2011 she was driving home when she saw a male running, chased by another male who was holding a machete in his right hand level with his head: T 142-3.
	
	
	She described the male who was being chased as medium to solid build wearing a turquoise jacket and long pants. She said “he was running for his life”: T 143. The male who was chasing was described by her as being medium build wearing a dark top and jeans. He had a ponytail. She had seen this male before saying that he often tied his hair in a ponytail. It was contended at trial by counsel for the applicant that the person who was chasing the other person was the deceased.
	
	
	Ms Gloria Anderson, sister of the deceased, lived ten minutes away by car from him. She said some time after the applicant moved in with Dale she visited Dale and noticed a bruise on his arm. He told her he had got hurt but said nothing about how it happened: T 61.
	
	
	Ms Anderson stated that on an occasion after Bella and her partner moved out of the Doonside premises, Dale went to Bella’s house and showed them bruising on his body – on his back, left side and ribs: T 61. He had a scratch down the left side. He had trouble breathing. He could not sit down properly. She said “He told us that Tony belted him”: T 61.
	
	
	On the night of Eileen Winikerei’s birthday, in March 2011, there was a cocktail party. Dale had left the party and returned. She said “he said Tony told him to fuck off out of his house; it was his house and chased him down the street with a knife”: T 62. She said Dale appeared agitated, scared, angry: T 62.
	
	
	Between the cocktail party and 2 May 2011 she said Dale lost weight. In that period she also said Dale had bruising, that “he had been hurt from Tony” – he told her he loved Tony. She added “… and I believe he did love Tony because he would do anything for Tony”: T 63.
	
	
	Ms Anderson stated that on 2 May 2011 she and her sister Bella had been standing outside the Doonside premises when she heard Tony say to the deceased, “You’re a dog”. She said he sounded “Really angry at Dale”: T 64.
	
	
	In relation to an incident on 25 May 2011, she said she went to the deceased’s place in the afternoon and she said that as she hugged him he lent away and she said “What’s the matter?”.

	Ms Anderson also stated that in the months leading up to his death she became aware that the deceased had been using drugs and that he had had a previous problem with prescription drugs: T 66. The latter problems had resolved.
	
	
	Ms Anderson said that she understood that the deceased was using “harder drugs” around the time of his death: T 66. This was based upon what others had told her and also she said that she had found syringes in his house both before and after his death: T 66.
	
	
	As to the deceased’s condition before his death, she said that he was not looking after himself and she thought that he might sell household items to pay for drugs: T 66.
	
	
	She agreed in cross-examination that she never saw the applicant physically mistreat her brother: T 67.
	
	
	Kirralee Howley, daughter of Ms Pardy, gave evidence of an incident she said she saw on 24 May 2011. She was then driving her mother and others home from the IGA Supermarket. As she approached a vacant lot of land she saw a man being chased by another man. The man who was doing the chasing was holding a samurai sword over his head. She said the blade was “pretty long”: T 148. She said the person being chased was “a bigger boy sort of thing”: T 149. She described that person as 160-170cm tall, similar to her own weight with fair skin and very short light brown hair, wearing a grey jumper. She said she had seen him around before: T 149-150.
	
	
	Ms Howley described the man with the samurai sword as being 170-180cm tall, of very skinny build, with tan coloured skin and black hair in a ponytail, which she referred to as a “piggytail”: T 150. She said she had seen this man a number of times in the street: T 150.

She described him as slim, approximately 5 foot 8 inches in height with long brown curly hair to his shoulders and olive skin: T 151. She said he was clean shaven and had brown eyes and she believed that he was from New Zealand.
	
	
	She also saw another male who was living at the Doonside premises about whom she gave evidence. She had seen that there had been a yellow combi-type van regularly parked in the driveway of the house where he and the deceased lived: T 152.
	
	
	She found out through a neighbour that this man was named Tony. She described him as of medium build, with light brown hair, and blue-green eyes but was not sure as to whether he was a little taller than the deceased: T 152.
	
	
	In March 2011, she had been sitting out the front of her house with a neighbour, Sam Crawford, when the deceased walked past. That was the first day she actually met him: T 152.
	
	
	In about the middle of April 2011 at 11:30pm she was out the front of her home having a cigarette and saw the deceased in the street. She said he looked as though he was hurt or maybe drunk. She thought that because he was “all over the place”: T 153
	
	
	She said he appeared unsteady on his feet and looked as though he was in pain, and was making groaning sounds: T 153.
	
	
	She said that one Friday afternoon the deceased came up to the letterbox of her place and “lifted up his shirt and said look at my back because we had just been fighting or something”: T 153.
	
	
	She said that he said that “we just had a fight”. She said this occurred with the person he was living with and he mentioned his name, “Tony”: T 153. Ms Sonmez later agreed that this was likely to have been Friday, 20 May 2011, one week before the deceased’s death.
	
	
	She described what she saw when the deceased lifted up his shirt. She said it looked red and bruised and that there were “bits of blood on the back”: T 154.
	
	
	In cross-examination she agreed that on the occasion when she was in the front of the house with her neighbour in March 2011, and the deceased had walked past, she told police that Sam Crawford had invited the deceased up and that was when she was introduced to him. She agreed that in her statement to police she had said that the deceased appeared upset due to not making eye contact with her or Sam. She asked if he was okay. He replied something similar to “Tony keeps going back to his wife”. T 155.
	
	
	She further agreed that she told police the deceased had said, “and if he wants to keep going back to his wife I want him to leave me”: T 156. She agreed that the deceased said those things in her presence. She agreed that she responded with words to the effect that he should ask Tony to leave as it was his house, that he was not happy or words to that effect. She agreed: T 156.
	
	
	It was put to Ms Sonmez, and she agreed, that she said that the deceased expressed to her feelings that he was “sick of Tony not treating him like a partner in a relationship because he kept on seeing his wife”: T 156.
	
	
	She also agreed that the deceased said to her that Tony’s wife lived a few streets away: T 156.
	
	
	In relation to the incident in about mid-April 2011 at about 11:30pm when she said she saw the deceased unsteady on his feet and groaning, she said that about a week later she spoke to the deceased about it and he told her that he had been mugged: T 157. She agreed that he said he had been walking down Kildare Road in Doonside with a backpack and had been mugged by a number of men in a car: T 157. He told her that they had bashed him and took his bag: T 157-8.
	
	
	A statement of Raylene Gregg dated 27 May 2011 was read to the jury during the trial. Ms Gregg gave evidence that she lived in the same street as the deceased. She had seen a man living at the deceased’s address who she described as between 40-50 years old, of small build and with dark skin and dark hair worn in a ponytail. She gave evidence that about two weeks prior to the date of her statement she saw this man chasing a yellow ute, ‘yelling words fast and loudly.’ She could not see who was driving the yellow ute: T 163.
	
	
	She also gave evidence that on 26 May 2011 she witnessed what she believed to be two males having a heated conversation in the front yard of the deceased’s address though she could not identify the men: T 164.
	
	
	A statement of Constable Alan Franklin was read to the jury. Constable Franklin had attended the deceased’s residence on 20 May 2011 at around 7:56pm in response to a call. He said that he spoke to a male who he now knows to have been the deceased. The deceased told him that he “had an argument with his friend that resulted in his friend hitting him on the back and then chasing him down the street…Lomas refused to reveal the identity of his friend and denied having any fears for his safety”: T 165. He gave evidence that he told the deceased to contact the police again if his friend returned or if he had any problems, to which the deceased replied “Everything’s fine, don’t worry about it”: T 166.
	


Evidence as to the Events of 26 May 2011


	
	The statement of Michael McCluskey dated 3 June 2011 (MFI 9) was read to the jury: T 172. Mr McCluskey had known the deceased for about ten years and had known the applicant for about twenty years. He described the deceased as being a “Kiwi with long black hair”. The applicant was said to have had short hair and a fair complexion. He said that he had not seen the applicant being violent in his presence, nor had the seen the deceased being violent. He said, “They were just argumentative with each other.”
	
	
	On Thursday, 26 May 2011, he said he met the deceased in Blacktown. He said this was for the specific reason of talking about whether Tony “was going to move out of the deceased’s place and whether he was still going to move in”: at [5].
	
	
	They returned to the deceased’s home where he said the deceased had “a bag of speed”. He said that the deceased mixed his “speed” up in the bag and he went and injected himself in the bathroom. He said that they had “a couple of cones of pot”.
	
	
	About fifteen minutes after the deceased and he took the speed the applicant came out of his room and there was a conversation about McCluskey saying to the applicant that he would have kept some speed for him had he known he was in the house. He said he could see that the applicant was angry about not getting any of the speed: at [8].
	
	
	McCluskey said that he knew that the deceased had told the applicant about three weeks before that the applicant “had to go”. He said that the deceased had previously told him about the applicant “giving him a clip across the earhole”: at [9]. He said that the deceased wanted the applicant to go “… as quick as possible because Tony wasn’t paying any rent and was spending all his money on drugs ...”: at [9].
	
	
	He said that after the applicant came out of his room on 26 May 2011, the applicant and the deceased were arguing continuously while he was there: at [10].
	
	
	Later that day he said goodbye to the deceased and the applicant and heard the deceased saying to the applicant “you’ve got to go you’re not paying your way”: at [14].
	
	
	Mr Vora, who was working for a sales and marketing company that worked on behalf of AGL, gave evidence of visiting various residents in Doonside on 26 May 2011. At 5:15pm on 26 May 2011, he went to the residence of the deceased and the applicant: T 174.
	
	
	He spoke to the deceased. He gave a description of the deceased at that time: T 175.
	
	
	Mr Vora’s evidence was firstly relevant to the deceased’s cognitive condition in the period immediately prior to him being stabbed by the applicant. On the evidence, the stabbing incident occurred not long after Mr Vora left the deceased. His evidence was that he left two or three minutes after 5:57pm. The Crown in their closing address put the time as being slightly after 6:00pm. Mr Vora’s evidence was also, in part, relevant to a question as to whether the deceased had ingested drugs with two males during the afternoon of 26 May 2011 (in addition to drugs ingested earlier that day.)
	
	
	Conversation turned to the question of a discount being available and Mr Vora commenced filling out some paperwork whilst he was outside the house. The deceased said that he had gone to find his wallet but had lost it and that all he had was his bank keycard. He showed the keycard to Mr Vora: T 176. Mr Vora said at that time he did not notice any injuries or anything unusual about the deceased.
	
	
	At the time of filling out the paperwork Mr Vora saw two other men at the house: T 177. Mr Vora said he made a verification call which involved somebody from Mr Vora’s company talking to the customer to verify details. The first of two verification calls ended at 5:36pm. The recording of the calls were played in court: T 178.
	
	
	After the call was terminated at 5:36pm Mr Vora said he spoke to the deceased who said “I used to live at my sister’s for four years and I am the one who pays the bills for that property, so can you set up a discount thing?”: T 178.
	
	
	Mr Vora asked him for the address and he gave an address in Castle Hill. He did not have a postcode so the deceased said that he would go inside and look in the Yellow Pages. He then went inside. About three or four minutes later he came out and told him the postcode. Mr Vora then completed the second contract and a communication form: T 179.
	
	
	He said the deceased signed the documents. Mr Vora then made the second verification call. The deceased also spoke to the operator during the second call: T 179.
	
	
	Mr Vora said that before he left the deceased, the deceased said to him “do you smoke?”. Mr Vora replied in the affirmative. Mr Vora said the deceased asked “can you give me one cigarette?” Mr Vora said that it was in his car which was parked away. He then left the Doonside premises.
	
	
	The second verification call, played in court, finished at 5:57pm.
	
	
	In cross-examination Mr Vora confirmed that the two other men who he referred to in evidence had been inside the house: T 182.
	
	
	He agreed that one of them said goodbye to the deceased. They then walked outside the gate: T 183.
	
	
	Evidence was given by Eddy Johnson who had been practicing as a Pastor for about 40 years: T 187. He worked in an office in Blacktown. The premises were a community centre.
	
	
	Pastor Johnson said he first met the applicant five or six years before May 2011. He said the applicant had been attending counselling, not with him but with somebody else at the community centre.
	
	
	He said that at about 9:30am on Thursday, 26 May 2011, he was at the Blacktown office. The applicant dropped in to use his phone, apparently for a job application. He remained there for about thirty minutes. He said he appeared “happy, glad, normal”: T 188.
	
	
	Pastor Johnson arrived home that night at about 7:00pm and received a call on his mobile phone at about 7:15pm: T 188. He recognised the applicant’s voice. He said that he was sobbing. He asked the applicant where he was. He said he found it difficult at first to understand him because the phone was fading. He told the applicant to calm down. The applicant said “please come, please come I need you Pastor Eddy”. The phone dropped out and he rang the applicant back. The applicant said he was at Alan Jones’ place.
	
	
	Pastor Johnson said that he contacted other members of the support group and made his way to the Doonside premises: T 190.
	
	
	He said that he knocked on the front door calling out to the applicant but there was no answer. He said he looked down the driveway and saw some dark splashes of liquid and recalled saying to the others “this looks like drops of blood”. This was about one metre from the front door: T 192.
	
	
	Pastor Johnson said he then saw the applicant out on the road. He approached him and said “What’s going on, what’s happened Anthony?”. He said the applicant was sobbing and was incoherent to some extent. He asked him to tell him what had happened. They moved away from the house and across the road. The applicant said “I want to die, I want to die. Give me a rope, find me a rope”: T 192. He asked the applicant what had happened and he said “he came at me with a knife and slashed my arm. So I let go, I think because of the words he used and the wrestling I stopped him”: T 192. Mr Johnson said he kept repeating “I want to die, I want to die”: T 192.
	
	
	He said he asked the deceased to show him his arm. He said he saw blood on his sleeves and said “Anthony, let me see what’s there”: T 193. The applicant rolled up his sleeve and he could see a slash on his left arm. When asked whether the applicant said anything about what had happened, Pastor Johnson said that he did not, other than saying “I stabbed him, I stabbed him” but that he appeared very distraught: T 193.
	
	
	When again asked whether the applicant disclosed information as to what had happened, Pastor Johnson said that the applicant said “somehow I got the knife away from him and I took the knife and then I stabbed him”: T 196. He was not sure as to what else he said although he said there may have been something like “we struggled a little bit”.
	
	
	Pastor Johnson was taken to his statement, at paragraph [12], where he referred to the applicant saying something about a knife and an arm. He was asked, having read the statement, whether there was something said about which he did not give evidence, namely, the applicant saying “I lost it”. Pastor Johnson confirmed that he had said those words. Pastor Johnson said that the applicant said the deceased slashed his arm with a knife and “I lost it then, I took the knife and I stabbed him”: T 197.
	


The ERISP


	
	Police interviewed the applicant on Thursday, 26 May 2011 at Doonside commencing at 9:10pm. The interview was conducted by Detective Sergeant Bristow. Detective Senior Constable Scott-Mahjet was present.
	
	
	The ERISP dated 26 May 2011 was admitted into evidence and played at the trial.
	
	
	The ERISP took place in a police caged vehicle in the deceased’s street approximately three hours after the death. This was relied upon by the applicant as important evidence due to the fact that the recording of the interview revealed the applicant to have been genuinely distraught over the death of the deceased. Relevant extracts of the ERISP are reproduced below. In summary, the applicant’s answers to police questions included reference to the following matters:
	



	
	The applicant and the deceased had a fight;
	
	
	The deceased, according to the applicant, was “going off his head because he (the applicant) was packing up:;
	
	
	The applicant said he did not know what to do;
	
	
	The applicant said the deceased had been shooting up and he was “drugged up”;
	
	
	The applicant said he grabbed the knife off the deceased and stabbed him once on the left side of his chest;
	
	
	The applicant said “everything was going mental” and the deceased slashed him a couple of times – that he just did not know what to do – “whether to keep letting him slash him or not”;
	
	
	The applicant said he tried to take the knife but “I just didn’t know what to do”;
	
	
	The applicant said earlier in the afternoon the deceased and other people were in the house taking drugs;
	
	
	The applicant told police he didn’t think the deceased wanted him to move out;
	
	
	When asked what his intention was when he stabbed the deceased, the applicant said he didn’t have any intention, and that it was reflex;
	
	
	When asked what he was trying to do with the knife, he replied “Just protect myself”;
	
	
	When asked whether it was his intention to kill, the applicant replied “No way, man”.
	



	
	The applicant agreed that he had told the police at the scene “We had a fight”: ERISP, p 2, Q.13.
	
	
	At Question 14 he was asked, “Who had a fight?”. He answered:
	


“A   Me and Dale. He was going off his head because I was packing up and then he um, went off and he had a knife and he slashed me. And I just don’t know what to do next so I just, I took it a couple of times.”

Q15   What did you take a couple of times?

A   A couple of slashes to me arms.

Q16   Yes.

A   ‘Cause I didn’t really want to fight, mate. You know what I mean? And then after a couple of times I just didn’t know what to do, man. I just, I didn’t know what to do.

Q17   And what happened from there?

A   I just stabbed him, stabbed him.”


	
	A little later he was asked:
	


Q24   Now Anthony, why did this happen?

A   I don’t really know. He was pilled off his, he was drugged up and he was shooting up there this afternoon, and drugged up and just arguing. I was packing up ‘cause I wanted to move out. I’ve been waiting to get out of there.

Q25   And why was that?

A   Because he keeps like putting it on me and stuff like that.

Q26   When you say putting it on you what are you referring to?

A   Like sexual advances and shit like that, mate.

Q27   All right. And is he a homosexual?

A   Yeah, I think so.

Q28   All right. Are you?

A   No.

Q29   How many times did you stab Dale, Anthony?

A   Just once.

Q30   … And what did you stab him with?

A   A knife.

Q31   And where did you get that knife from?

A   I grabbed it off him.

Q32   And can you tell me how that took place?

A   Oh, we were just going everything was just going mental and he slashed me a couple of times and I just didn’t know what to do, I just didn’t know whether to keep on letting him slash me or not.

Q33   Right.

A   You know what I mean? I tried to take it but I just didn’t know what to do.

Q34   How many times did he slash you?

A   Maybe about three or four times.”


	
	The applicant was asked the following questions and gave the following answers:
	


“Q40   And do you recall what time this happened this evening?

A   Oh, probably about, I don’t know, about three quarters of an hour I’d say before youse come.

Q41   All right. And what did you do after it happened?

A   I come up here to see me neighbour.

Q42   And who did you see?

A   Al.

Q43   And has Al got a last name?

A   Um - - -

Q44   Do you know what - - -

A   - - - Jones.

Q45   Jones is it. Do you know what number Al lives at?

A   [address provided]

Q46   And how do you know him?

A   I’ve known him for years.

Q47   And what did you say to him?

A   I told him what happened.

…

Q50   Now what was it that you said to him when you got to his place?

A   Exactly what I said to you.

Q51   And can you repeat for me what that was?

A   That Dale was going off his head and slashed me a couple of times and I took it a couple of, like I took a couple of slashes because I didn’t know what to do. I didn’t know whether to respond or just to take it.

Q52   Yep.

A   And then after a couple of times I seen this one was really open.

Q53   Yep.

A   And I thought it was a bit too dangerous to be just copping it.

Q54   Yep.

A   So I grabbed it and stabbed him.

Q55   All right. So are you telling me that you were just standing there taking it?

A   Yeah.

Q56   And whereabouts in the house was this happening?

A   In the lounge room.

Q57   O.K. And where did, where did Dale end up?

A   Fell on to the lounge.

Q58   Did he?

A   (NO AUDIBLE REPLY)

Q59   All right. How on the lounge? I haven’t seen him so - - -

A   He just fell back all over the lounge.

Q60   All right. Now the, the knife that you used to stab Dale, was that the same knife that he attacked you with?

A   Yeah.

Q61   Where did that come from?

A   I don’t know.

Q62   Do you know where Dale got it from?

A   It was in, it was in the house.

Q63   Do you know whereabouts in the house?

A   No, I wouldn’t have a clue, mate. He was going off his head going right through the house, tearing the house up and stuff like that. You know what I mean?”


	
	A little later the following questions and answers were recorded:
	


“Q65   Oh, O.K. How long had the two of you been at home together this afternoon and tonight?

A   Not long. He had other people up there like taking drugs and stuff. So I come down here and just to avoid it, mate. I didn’t like the, you know, the situation.

Q66   Yep.

A   So I come down here and did a little bit of work with the boys down here on the car.

Q67   And do you know what time that was?

A   No, I couldn’t tell you what time it was, man.

Q68   O.K. How long before Dale got stabbed was that?

A   When we finished doing that I went up and locked meself in the room because there was, you know, he still had a mate and that there.

Q69   Do you know who that was?

A   Um, no, I didn’t know the bloke, mate.

Q70   O.K. When you went back up to the unit where Dale was, was it daylight or dark?

A   I think it was just on dark.

Q71   All right. So before you stabbed Dale how long had you been back home?

A   Um, a little bit ‘cause I laid in the room and watched a um, video. It was Missing In Action, so, you know - - -

Q72   Like a DVD or something was it?

A   Yeah, just a video.

Q73   O.K. All right.

A   ‘Cause I stayed in me room ‘cause he was going, I knew he was going off his head and blah, blah, blah and you know what I mean, I knew, I started packing me stuff and that. And um, you know what I mean, I don’t think he wanted me to move out. And he was just going off his head, you know, it was more like, it was really hard to read, it was like um, he was jealous that I was moving out or something, man. You know what I’m saying?

Q74   All right.

A   Like - - -

Q75   And do you know why that would have been?

A   I don’t know.

…

Q78   O.K. And when did this problem start between you and Dale today?

A   When he come home this afternoon in a mood.

Q79   You were already there?

A   Well I was there but I just walked out and come down here and, you know what I mean - - -

Q80   What time was that that he come home?

A   I’m not too sure, mate.

Q81   All right. Was it still daylight?

A   Yeah, yeah.

Q82   Yeah. All right. Was it still daylight when you came down to your friends place here?

A   Yeah, ‘cause I worked on the car with them.”


	
	The applicant was then questioned about the stabbing incident:
	


“Q83   O.K. All right. And can you tell me how it was that you stabbed Dale with the knife?

A   What do you mean?

Q84   How did you do it?

A   I just grabbed it and went like that.

Q85   All right. So you’ve indicated with your right hand.

A   Yeah.

Q86   Are you right handed or left handed?

A   Yeah, right handed.

Q87   O.K. Did you have the knife in your right hand?

A   Yep.

Q88   All right. And you indicated just then a type of sideways motion.

A   Yeah, I just, sort of like swung it at him.

Q89   O.K. And what was your um, what were you trying to do by doing that?

A   I didn’t really have any intentions to do anything really.

Q90   All right.

A   It was just, it was reflex really.

Q91   Yep.

A   It was just, I don’t know, I was scared, I was confused. I didn’t know really what to do, man.

Q92   All right.

A   Honestly, I didn’t know what to do, mate.

Q93   And how were you sort of feeling at the time that you stabbed him with the knife?

A   Fucken terrible, mate.

Q94   And, you right? What was it that you were trying to do with the knife?

A   Just protect meself.

Q95   All right. And how many times did you swing it at him?

A   Just once.”


	
	The applicant was then asked the following questions and gave the following answers:
	


“Q103   Yep. O.K. Now what was it that you were trying to do by trying to get him with the knife?

A   I was just trying to swing it around and like just scare him back. But I think he stepped in or something. He was just going wild, mate. I don’t know what really happened, mate, it just went so quick. I just don’t know what happened.

Q104   Yep. How does he compare in size to you?

A   We’re about the same size I think.

Q105   All right. O.K. Now - - -

A   But mate, he goes right off his head, when he’s on pills and shit, mate. When he’s on drugs he goes right off his fucken head, mate. He come down here and he attacked me down here the other night and shit like that, mate.

Q106   Yep.

A   He’s done it, he’s done it a few times, man.

Q107   And when he’s attacked you before have those matters been reported to the police?

A   (NO AUDIBLE REPLY)

Q108   You’re nodding your head from side to side.

A   No, I didn’t worry about it.

Q109   O.K. Have you ever reported any attacks by him on you to the police?

A   There was one incident yup here where he was smashing up some timber.

Q110   Yep.

A   And he was throwing it at me so I picked up a bit of timber and just slapped him on the side.

Q111   Oh, O.K.

A   And he rang the police, but he was throwing shit at me and hit me in the head like, I don’t know what it was, mate, he was just throwing all me shit at me and hitting me in the head with like, I think it was a bag of old remotes or something, you know.

Q112   Yep. TV remotes and stuff like that.

Q129   Did he say anything to you after he got stabbed with the knife?

A   No.""


	
	On Friday, 27 May 2011 at 2:45am, Detective Senior Constable Harris interviewed Alan Jones. The record of interview became Exhibit M in the proceedings. Mr Jones said that the night before the applicant came to the door and came into his house. He said he looked agitated and upset (A11). In Answer 12 the following was recorded:
	


“I asked him what was the matter. He came and sat down where my shoulders are on this chair, on the lounge, it’s a bed really, and sat down here and just rocked around a bit. He was shaking. I said, ‘What have you done now?’ And he just didn’t give me an answer. Then he started crying. And then he got up, went to the kitchen, come back out again and he sat down there and he said, ‘I’ve hurt Dale.’ I think it’s Dale isn’t it? I’m not sure. Dale. I said, ‘What did you do?’ And I got no answer from him at all. He said, ‘I want to ring Pastor’, Pastor Eddie.”


	
	In relation to the relationship between the deceased and the applicant, he was asked:
	


“Q51   O.K. And do you know what relationship that Tony has with Dale?

A   Well it wasn’t very good.

Q52   What do you mean by that?

A   Well every time he come up he said I can’t handle this cunt I’m living with.

Q53   Yep.

A   But he was going to go and live with his brother, but apparently that fell through.

Q54   Yep.

A   And after that he was really upset about that. But he said, I’ve got to move. Well, the end result …. But he was agitated for weeks before, before this happened.”


	
	Mr Jones was recorded as saying that the applicant indicated to him that he and the deceased did not have a good relationship (Q58) and that he did not get along with the deceased “’cause he used to knock off his cigarettes and all that” (Q59). Additionally, the applicant had said to him a couple of weeks before the incident “If I don’t move from this prick something’s going to happen between us” (Q 62). He was asked:
	


“Q64   So what, what was that all about a couple of weeks ago?

A   Oh, it was over money or something.”


	
	In answer to Question 69 he said that the applicant showed him a cut. He said “He had a really nasty cut”.
	


The Expert Evidence


	
	The medical evidence established that the cause of the deceased’s death was a single stab wound to the left posterior lateral aspect of the chest. Other injures were noted on the deceased, the most significant of which was a fractured hyoid bone. This was consistent with manual strangulation: Dr Van Vuuren at T 307. In cross-examination, Dr Van Vuuren agreed, however, that she could not rule out the possibility that the injury occurred as a result of squeezing and pushing in a defensive action: T 319.
	
	
	Evidence given by Dr Perl, pharmacologist, was directed at establishing the level of methylamphetamine in the deceased’s body and the possibility that this may have caused the deceased to have acted aggressively.
	
	
	Dr Perl gave evidence that a number of substances were found in the deceased’s blood including amphetamine, methylamphetamine, clonazepam and delta-9-THC acid (which is commonly found in cannabis). Dr Perl gave evidence that the concentration of methylamphetamine found in the deceased was in the toxic range which would generally mean that the user would experience adverse effects and impairment, but that these effects would vary according to the user’s level of tolerance: T 325.
	
	
	Dr Perl gave evidence that the drug must have been used at least two to four hours prior to death because it was partially metabolised. She said that the drug may have also been used at other times during the day: T 326.
	
	
	The effects of the drug on the deceased would have varied, according to Dr Perl, depending upon what time of the day the drug was used. She described two phases of expected effects of methylamphetamine use – the first being excitability, increased alertness, hyperactivity, talkativeness, agitation and paranoia which would occur after use. The second was a phase of withdrawal which would occur as the drug wore off. The effects on the user in this phase would include sleepiness, fatigue and slow movements. The intensity of the experience would depend upon the blood level and the user’s level of tolerance: T 326.
	
	
	Dr Perl gave evidence that the deceased, based on his interactions with the AGL representative, did not appear to be grossly impaired: T 330. On the assumption that the deceased had used methylamphetamine around midday, consistent with the statement of Mr McCluskey, Dr Perl gave evidence that he would have been in the withdrawal state. However, there could not be excluded the possibility that there may have been usage of methylamphetamine on more than one occasion during the day. If the deceased had taken a knife to the accused, Dr Perl stated such aggressive behaviour would be consistent with methylamphetamine use: T 339.
	


Applicant’s Submissions


	
	Mr Stratton SC, who appeared on behalf of the applicant, submitted that the injuries taken in isolation, especially given that there was only one stab wound, did not establish an intention to either kill or inflict grievous bodily harm. If that were the applicant’s intention, the question was posed, ‘Why stop at one stab wound?’
	
	
	It was submitted, however, that the injuries to the deceased should not be taken in isolation. They should be considered in the context of the injuries to the applicant, in particular, the injuries depicted in Exhibit F. The wounds to the applicant’s left arm, it was contended, could not be taken as superficial wounds and there was no suggestion that they had been self-inflicted.
	
	
	It was submitted that there was no evidence to support the Crown hypothesis put to the jury, namely, that the applicant first attacked the deceased and the deceased then lashed out at him with the knife, before the applicant wrestled the knife off him and stabbed him. A difficulty with that hypothesis, it was submitted, was that, apart from the stab wound, the injuries to the deceased were quite limited.
	
	
	The events all occurred in the lounge room of the Doonside premises where the deceased’s body was located and where all of the deceased’s blood was located. The applicant’s submissions posed the question “If the applicant was [on the Crown case] strangling the deceased in the lounge room, how did the deceased get access to a knife?”
	
	
	It was submitted that taking into account the physical evidence and the pattern of injuries on the applicant and the deceased, the following was the more consistent course of events:
	


“The deceased attacked the applicant with a knife which he had brought with him into the lounge room, probably from the kitchen”: (Applicant’s Written Submissions at [141])


	
	Reference was made to Exhibit A, a photograph that appeared to show a knife block in the kitchen with empty spaces for knives.
	
	
	The submission for the applicant continued:
	


“The deceased inflicted the injuries on the [applicant’s] arms as the [applicant] attempted to ward off the blows with his hands and arms. The [applicant] managed to wrestle the knife off him. Taken by surprise, and in what was in effect a life and death struggle, the [applicant] inflicted a single knife wound to the [applicant], which was tragically fatal.” (Applicant’s Written Submissions at [142])

The Crown Submissions


	
	The Crown case at trial was not that the applicant intended to kill the deceased or that the offence was premeditated. It was that the applicant intended to inflict grievous bodily harm.
	
	
	The central issue at trial, the Crown observed, was whether the Crown had established that the act causing the death of the deceased was not done in self-defence.
	
	
	The Crown relied at trial upon the following matters to establish that the applicant must have intended to inflict grievous bodily harm:
	



	
	The nature and extent of the injuries received by the deceased;
	
	
	The weapon used; and
	
	
	The placement of the injury. (Crown Written Submissions at [8])
	



	
	The Crown also relied upon:
	



	
	The relationship evidence between the deceased and the applicant, including the evidence as to the observations of friends and family of injuries said to have been inflicted on the deceased in the past as outlined above at [136]-[188];
	
	
	The fact that one of the applicant’s first accounts after the killing was to tell Pastor Johnson that he “lost it” as part of his explanation for killing the deceased and the fact that the deceased had been trying to get the applicant to move out of the premises for some time to no avail: (Crown Written Submissions at [8])
	



	
	There were, the Crown submitted before this Court, a number of “compelling reasons” why the jury rejected the applicant’s account at least in part: (Crown Written Submissions at [9]).
	
	
	The Crown first drew attention to the medical evidence of Dr Van Vuuren that indicated that the track of the wound extended through the left lung to the heart and was about 24 cm deep. This was put to the jury by the Crown as being inconsistent with the applicant simply trying to get the deceased away from him. It was more consistent with an intentional swinging of the knife with an intention to injure the deceased: (Crown Written Submissions at [12].)
	
	
	The Crown, secondly, drew attention to the fracture of the hyoid bone which the evidence indicated would have required “moderate to severe” force to cause. This was consistent with manual strangulation. It was submitted that Dr Van Vuuren had not agreed in cross-examination that the fracture could have been caused by force to the front of the neck in a pushing action, as someone may do if defending themself, but only by squeezing (T 319:12). As noted above, the applicant’s submission relied upon evidence of Dr Van Vuuren at T 319 for the contrary proposition, ie, what was said to have been a concession by her that she could not rule out the possibility that the fracture occurred as a result of pushing in a defensive action.
	
	
	It is convenient to refer at this point to the evidence of Dr Vuuren in cross-examination, as follows (T 319:10-21):
	


“Q.   Grabbing around the neck first and squeezing and/or pushing, could that explain some of the injuries that you saw?

A.   The squeezing would more account for the injuries, not the pushing.

Q.   There could have been squeezing and pushing?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And you cannot rule out the possibility that if the injury occurred in the manner I suggested with the arm out and the fingers are under the neck and the hand under the neck, you cannot rule out the possibility that that occurred in a that defensive motion or defensive action, can you?

A.   No you cannot.”


	
	The Crown also pointed to evidence as to other injuries suffered by the deceased that were said to be indicative of the use of force by the applicant and consistent with being “defence wounds”: (Crown Written Submissions at [14].) These included superficial wounds to the palm of the left hand of the deceased consistent with defence wounds. Reference in this regard was made to Dr Van Vuuren’s evidence: “It would indicate that the deceased was grabbing the knife, trying to deflect it from his body”: T 308:36-37.
	
	
	It is convenient at this point to extract Dr Van Vuuren’s evidence in chief on this point:
	


“Q.   Doctor, in your post-mortem examination you also noted what you have referred to as superficial injuries present on the palm of the left hand consistent with self-defence wounds?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Are you able to indicate where those superficial injuries were on the left palm of the left hand?

A.   There was a small cut to the left thumb, and also the left index finger.

Q.   Doctor, are you able to give an opinion as to whether those superficial injuries you have indicated to the thumb and the index finger, could they have been occasioned at the same time as that stab wound?

A.   Yes they could be.

Q.   Why do you say that?

A.   Well they had a similar appearance like a recent cut, as the stab wound. They appeared to be the same.

Q.   And considering it was the deceased’s left hand, and the wound was to the left back, what do you say about that as being indicative of occurring at the same time as the stab wound?

A.   it could indicate that the deceased was grabbing the knife trying to deflect it from his body, and then the cuts could appear.

Q.   But it’s also possible they could have occurred at another time, but from what you have seen, and from your experience it’s your opinion that they occurred at the same time; is that right?

A.   Yes, that’s correct.” (T 308:15-42)


	
	In the cross-examination of Dr Van Vuuren on the subject of the left hand injuries the only question put to Dr Van Vuuren was whether she agreed that the wounds to the left palm and left thumb were “superficial”: T 313:10-30; 315:1-6.
	
	
	In addition to the left hand, other injuries to the deceased included an injury under the jaw consistent with some force applied to the neck and an abrasion to the nose: T 311. There was also a cut inside the mouth apparently caused by a tooth. These injuries would have required some force according to Dr Van Vuuren: T 312:13. There were cuts above the left eyelid and an abrasion in that area: T 312.
	
	
	As mentioned, the Crown submission was that there was sufficient evidence at trial to establish an intention in the applicant to inflict grievous bodily harm upon the deceased – particularly the moderate to severe amount of force required to cause the fatal stab wound, the nature of the weapon used and the location of the stab wound in the chest: (Crown Written Submissions at [15].)
	
	
	The Crown also submitted that whilst the injury to the hyoid bone and the other injuries were not as significant as the fatal stab wound, they were not consistent with the version given by the applicant in the ERISP: (Crown Written Submissions at [16].)
	
	
	The relationship evidence, the Crown submitted, provided relevant context. The jury had been instructed that they were not to use the evidence as tendency evidence and were given appropriate directions as to its use as context evidence. The Crown referred in summary form to the evidence given by family members and friends: (Crown Written Submissions at [19]-[20].)
	
	
	The Crown also referred to the evidence as to instances relied upon by the applicant as revealing violent conduct by the deceased: (Crown Written Submissions at [21]-[22].)
	
	
	Reference was made to the evidence of Sandra Crawford (T 115) to the effect that that the deceased on the day of the stabbing was angry with the applicant. The Crown noted that this was relied upon by the applicant as undermining the relationship evidence. The Crown submitted, however, that this was consistent with the deceased becoming increasingly frustrated over the fact that the applicant would not move out and his desire for him to do so: (Crown Written Submissions at [24].)
	
	
	The Crown set out in its Written Submissions at [25]-[34] a summary of relevant events after the applicant stabbed the deceased. It was noted that the time of the stabbing could be narrowed down to the period 6:02pm to 6:08pm by reason of the evidence of Mr Vora who left the premises at about 6:02pm and the evidence of the telephone call of Mr Matthew Holmes at 6:08pm. The Crown submitted that the delay that followed the incident before it was reported to police was significant.
	
	
	The Crown referred to the statements made by the applicant after the incident to a number of persons noting that there was no evidence that the applicant had tried to contact police or triple-zero.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that whilst the applicant relied upon the distress he demonstrated to others (including police) as being inconsistent with an intention to inflict grievous bodily harm upon the deceased, this was equally consistent with the applicant realising the consequences of his action and likely punishment: (Crown Written Submissions at [34].) Additionally, the distress was not inconsistent with the subsequent development of remorse for what he had done.
	


CONSIDERATION

Evidence Relied Upon to Support the Crown Case


	
	The jury’s guilty verdict indicates that, having rejected the defence of self-defence, it was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant intended to inflict grievous bodily harm on the deceased.
	
	
	The Crown case, inter alia, relied upon the following factual matters:
	



	
	The proposition that the deceased wanted the applicant to move out of the house in circumstances in which the deceased held the lease of the premise. This was relied upon by the Crown at trial as a basis for rejecting the applicant’s version of events.
	
	
	The evidence of Gloria Anderson (T 71-2), Ms Bella Winikerei (T 87-88, 92), Ms Eileen Winikerei (T 101), Peter Rofe (T 121-2) and the Statement of Michael McCluskey (T 171) as support for the proposition in (1) above along with Exhibit G, a note found at the premises written by the deceased which included the statement “… I am tired of you kicking me in the teeth all the time” and a statement to the effect that the applicant had seven days to get his stuff out: Constable Jorgenson (T 267). I note that there was no evidence that the applicant had seen the note.
	
	
	An SMS message from the deceased to the applicant on 20 May 2011 stating, inter alia, “You have until 2pm to get my money to me [before] my family chucks your things on the road dale”: Exhibit L.
	
	
	The fact that certain evidence contradicted the applicant’s own version which was that he and the deceased had had “a fight”, that the deceased was “going off his head” because the applicant was “packing up” and the deceased then attacked him with the knife. The Crown properly noted, however, that the applicant also relied upon particular aspects of the relationship evidence, in particular, the evidence of the deceased’s actions on other occasions that involved violence or that evidenced a violent disposition by the deceased towards him. Reliance was also placed upon Exhibit G, a handwritten note by the deceased, as to a suggestion that he, the deceased, was trying to continue the relationship. Exhibit G stated in part: “…I’ve told you before that if you and Kathy get back together I want you to move out …”
	
	
	The evidence of Dr Van Vuuren, in particular, upon the matters referred to above in [252] and [254].
	
	
	That on the applicant’s version, once he had disarmed the deceased by taking the knife from him, there was no need to stab him in the location he did and using the force he did.
	
	
	As to the evidence concerning the likely cause of the fracture of the hyoid bone, the applicant’s account recorded in the ERISP did not refer to him “squeezing” or “pushing” the deceased’s throat in self-defence”, both of which Dr Van Vuuren had been asked to assume occurred during the course of her cross-examination.
	
	
	The applicant’s statement to Pastor Johnson in which he said he “lost it”.
	



	
	In relation to the relationship evidence referred to in (2) above, I consider that such evidence was of limited probative value as context evidence. As I have earlier stated, the evidence as to the relationship between the deceased and the accused was ambiguous and contradictory as illustrated by Exhibit G and the evidence of the deceased being angry on the day he was killed.
	


Whether an Unreasonable Verdict


	
	The determination of whether the verdict is unreasonable involves a question of fact and, inter alia, involves a determination whether notwithstanding that there is evidence upon which the jury may convict, nonetheless it would be dangerous in all the circumstances to allow the verdict of guilty to stand: M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; 181 CLR 487 at 492-3 referred to in SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; 243 CLR 400 at [14] per French CJ, Gummow and Kiefel JJ.
	
	
	This Court, of course, must not disregard or discount either the consideration that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, or the consideration that the jury had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses.
	
	
	Whilst as a matter of law there was evidence in these proceedings to support a verdict of murder, the question for this Court on appeal is whether upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant was guilty. The physical evidence that establishes that the applicant was seriously wounded by the deceased with a knife, together with the applicant’s version in the ERISP that indicated a continuing or further attempt by the deceased to assault him after the knife was taken off him, are of central importance in the assessment of the whole of the evidence. Whilst there is evidence upon which a jury might convict, when all the matters established in evidence are considered I have concluded that it would be dangerous to allow the verdict of guilty to stand.
	
	
	A reasonable doubt as to the applicant’s alleged state of mind (intent to inflict grievous bodily harm) in my assessment of the evidence, inescapably arises on the evidence at trial. It established that in the course of a fight between the applicant and the deceased, the deceased attacked the applicant by deliberately inflicting serious injury to his left arm using the knife. Whilst in the course of the continuing violent struggle the applicant forcibly took the knife off the deceased, that did not stop the deceased from physically confronting the applicant in what by then had become a chaotic and violent situation culminating in the applicant holding the knife and swinging it in a type of sideways motion before he stabbed the deceased. The evidence establishes, as a matter of strong inference, that all such actions represented a continuous and rapidly unfolding series of events leaving very little time for reflection.
	


Order Granting a New Trial


	
	The power of this Court on an appeal against conviction to order a new trial is provided for in s 8 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. That section is in the following terms:
	


(1)   On an appeal against a conviction on indictment, the court may, either of its own motion, or on the application of the appellant, order a new trial in such manner as it thinks fit, if the court considers that a miscarriage of justice has occurred, and, that having regard to all the circumstances, such miscarriage of justice can be more adequately remedied by an order for a new trial than by any other order which the court is empowered to make.

(2)   Provision shall be made by rules of court for detaining the appellant until the fresh trial has terminated, or for ordering the appellant into any former custody.


	
	The section gives a wide discretionary power to order a new trial but it in every case requires a sound exercise of the discretion: Gerakiteys v The Queen [1984] HCA 8; 153 CLR 317, 321 per Gibbs J.
	
	
	In the present proceedings I propose below a new trial order. On that basis, whether a second trial should proceed for manslaughter can be safely left to the discretion of the Director of Public Prosecutions, a discretion which it may be assumed will be exercised responsibly, having regard to this Court’s observations before framing an indictment which the evidence is capable of supporting.
	
	
	I propose that the appeal be allowed, that the conviction and sentence below be quashed and that a new trial be ordered.
	
	
	WILSON J: I have had the advantage of reading in draft both the judgment of Hoeben CJ at CL and that of Hall J.
	
	
	The facts of the matter and the evidence that was before the jury have been fully set out in both judgments, and I do not propose to repeat them.
	


Ground 1: The verdict was unreasonable and cannot be supported on the evidence


	
	In considering this ground this Court must make its own assessment of the evidence in order to determine whether, on the whole of the evidence, it was open for the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was guilty of the murder of Mr Lomas: M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; 181 CLR 487; SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; 243 CLR 400.
	
	
	The Crown argues that it was open to the jury on the evidence before it to conclude that, in inflicting a single stab wound to the deceased, the applicant intended to inflict grievous bodily harm upon him. It relies upon the nature, extent and placement of the wound to establish the existence of that intention. Reliance is also placed upon evidence of the nature of the relationship between the applicant and the deceased, and upon purported inconsistencies in the accounts the applicant gave to others of what had taken place in the hours after the stabbing.
	
	
	Having reviewed all of the evidence, and particularly, those aspects upon which the Crown principally relies, I am left with a reasonable doubt as to the applicant’s guilt for the crime of murder. In my view, none of the aspects of the evidence cited by the Crown have the significance that the Crown argues for.
	
	
	I agree generally with the analysis of Hoeben CJ at CL, and so my comments will be brief.
	
	
	I do not think that the evidence of the injuries to the deceased can be made to do the work the Crown suggests it can. That is particularly so having regard to the qualifications to the evidence of the forensic pathologist who conducted the post-mortem examination of the deceased in cross-examination. Both Hoeben CJ at CL (at [89]) and Hall J (at [251]) have referred to the doctor’s evidence on the possible significance of the broken hyoid bone. In short, Dr Van Vuuren could not exclude the possibility that the injury was inflicted during the course of a defensive action by the applicant. Similarly, whilst the evidence was that the fatal stab wound was inflicted with a moderate to severe degree of force, that does not of itself preclude it from having been inflicted as the applicant swung out with the knife in his own defence, as he said he did (at Q&A88 of the ERISP), and as Dr Van Vuuren conceded was possible.
	
	
	That the deceased had some minor lacerations, interpreted as defence wounds, has to be viewed in the overall context of what occurred. The physical evidence points clearly to a struggle between the applicant and the deceased for possession of the knife. Such injuries as the deceased displayed are readily attributable to this struggle. They do not, in my view, point without doubt to an attack upon the deceased by the applicant, which the deceased unsuccessfully tried to defend himself against.
	
	
	Both Hoeben CJ at CL (at [106]) and Hall J (at [267]) have considered the significance of the relationship evidence and concluded that it could do no more than establish the volatile nature of the relationship between the applicant and the deceased. I agree with those conclusions. It would appear that there were incidents of violence between the applicant and the deceased, but such violence was by no means entirely attributable to the applicant. There was a reasonably significant body of evidence that established that the deceased had assaulted the applicant, on occasion with weapons including a knife. The relationship evidence could do little or nothing to support a conclusion that it was the applicant who wielded the knife with murderous intent on this occasion.
	
	
	Whilst the Crown relies upon asserted inconsistencies in the accounts given by the applicant of the stabbing in the hours immediately following it to suggest that the jury was entitled to reject the applicant’s claim of self defence, what seems significant to me is the degree of consistency in his accounts. There was certainly a delay in the applicant summonsing help, but that may indicate nothing more than the applicant’s state of shock and distress following the stabbing. That he was extremely distressed is not in issue; that is the evidence of all witnesses who spoke with the applicant in those first hours, and it is very clearly his presentation in his recorded interview with police.
	
	
	Despite the shock and distress under which the applicant was clearly labouring when speaking with his pastor and with police, he was entirely consistent in his assertions that the deceased had attacked him with a knife and, after being seriously injured, he had defended himself. Those accounts were available to the jury to use as some evidence of the facts asserted, given that the representations were made at a time when they must have been fresh in the applicant’s mind: s66 of the Evidence Act 1995; Graham v The Queen [1998] HCA 61; 195 CLR 606.
	
	
	Such inconsistencies as exist are minor, and do not detract from the overall consistency of the applicant’s account. Having regard to the terrible wound inflicted to the applicant’s arm, and the other physical evidence, the most likely scenario in my view is that the deceased attacked the applicant with a knife (perhaps in a drug fuelled rage given the level of methylamphetamine in his blood) and injured him; there was a struggle for the knife, during which the deceased sustained the “defence” wounds; and, having gotten possession of the knife, the applicant swung out believing it was necessary to do so in his own defence.
	
	
	These events have to be considered in context: this was a violent and rapidly moving altercation between two individuals who had shared an emotionally fraught and perhaps ambivalent relationship. The incident was not one that would have lent itself to rational analysis of the options available to diffuse the situation.
	
	
	Although I am loathe to disturb the verdict of a jury, a body which is almost always in a superior position to that of this Court to assess evidence given in its presence, in this case I am left with a pervasive doubt as to the applicant’s guilt for murder.
	
	
	Since there was no real dispute about the objective evidence, the advantage usually enjoyed by the jury over this Court is not an advantage that can address that doubt.
	
	
	In my view, the evidence adduced in the Crown case was capable of establishing manslaughter by excessive self-defence, but it could not establish murder to the criminal standard. I therefore agree with the Chief Judge at Common Law that the verdict cannot stand.
	
	
	I also agree with his observations (at [121]) that the Crown case will not improve if placed before a jury for a second trial. On all of the evidence there must be a doubt of the applicant’s liability for murder. Accordingly, I would set aside the verdict of the jury, quash the conviction, and enter an acquittal in the applicant’s favour.
	
	
	Should the Crown decide to do so, there is sufficient evidence for the applicant to be tried for the manslaughter of Mr Lomas. In that regard, I agree with the observations of Hoeben CJ at CL at [121] – [123], and do not propose to address the remaining grounds.
	


Conclusion


	
	I agree with the orders proposed by the Chief Judge at Common Law.

2703357,Whitby v R [2015] NSWCCA 124,"Judgment


	
	MACFARLAN JA: I agree with R S Hulme AJ.
	
	
	JOHNSON J: I agree with R S Hulme AJ.
	
	
	RS HULME AJ:  On 29 August 2013 this Applicant for leave to appeal was sentenced by Lakatos SC DCJ in respect of three offences.
	
	
	The first offence was that between 20 January 2012 and 7 March 2012 he supplied not less than a large commercial quantity, 1.182.56 kg, of 3,4-methylene-dioximethylamphetamine, commonly known as ecstasy. The minimum large commercial quantity of that drug is 500 g. The maximum penalty for that offence is life imprisonment and a substantial fine and a standard non-parole period of 15 years has been prescribed.
	
	
	The second offence was of supplying not less than the commercial quantity of methylamphetamine between 15 December 2011 and 22 March 2012. The maximum penalty prescribed for this offence is imprisonment for 20 years and a substantial fine. A standard non-parole period of 10 years has been prescribed. The offence involved the supply of 807.8 g, ie a little more than three times the minimum commercial quantity of 250 g and approaching the upper limit of that quantity and the bottom of the large commercial range.
	
	
	The third offence was of supplying not less than an indictable quantity of methorphan – an offence carrying a maximum period of imprisonment of 15 years and a substantial fine. The amount supplied was 72.1 g, something over 14 times the minimum indictable quantity of 5 g.
	
	
	In sentencing the Applicant for the first offence, Lakatos DCJ took into account a further offence being the supply of 0.59 g of ecstasy in the form of 2 tablets.
	
	
	The sentences imposed were:
	


For the first offence, imprisonment for a non-parole period of 4 years and 3 months commencing on 1 November 2012 together with a balance of term of 3 years and 3 months.

For the second offence, imprisonment for a non-parole period of 3 years commencing on 1 May 2012 together with a balance of term of 1 year.

For the third offence, imprisonment for a fixed term of 2 years commencing on 1 May 2012.


	
	The effective sentence imposed was thus one of 8 years, including a non-parole period of 4 years and 9 months. The sentence for the third offence was entirely encompassed by the sentence imposed for the second offence. The sentences for the second and third offences extended the periods the subject of the sentence for the first offence by 6 months.
	
	
	The drugs the subject of the first charge were supplied on six occasions and involved quantities varying between 0.5 g (a sample) and approximately 645 g and a purity varying between about 8 and 21%. Included within the charge was also one quantity that formed an instance of deemed supply.
	
	
	The second count reflected three occasions of supply, the purity being of the order of 6%. The third count involving the supply of 72.1 g was constituted by the supply on one occasion of 200 tablets, on a second occasion of 5 tablets supplied as a test sample and a third supply of 50 tablets.
	
	
	The evidence of the Applicant’s offending was placed before Lakatos DCJ in the form of a statement of agreed facts. In short, a Police Strike Force was established and initially focussed on a co-offender Remfrey but in due course was extended to surveillance of the Applicant and others. The Applicant obtained his drugs from two persons, Clark and Dodd, the latter being able to supply larger quantities, and then supplied the drugs to Remfrey and an undercover operative who had been introduced to the Applicant by Remfrey in the course of a controlled operation. A search of the Applicant’s home after his arrest revealed indicia of drug dealing including a small quantity of white powder and tablets, a running sheet with prices, a number of mobile phones and a large number of plastic resealable bags. The Crown calculated the profit the Applicant had made over the three months covered by some of the charges as $3,400 and his Honour concluded it was not more than $4000. The total amount of purchase money that had passed through the Applicant’s hands or in deals facilitated by him was $76,000, none of which was recovered. Although his Honour accepted that the undercover officer was the driving force in inducing the Applicant to supply the quantities he did, and observed that there was nothing to suggest that previously the Applicant had been involved in the supply of quantities similar to those the subject of the charges, he concluded that the Applicant was a willing participant, it being in his interests financially and otherwise to make the drug transactions as profitable an exercise as he could. He described the Applicant as, in effect, a middleman for the supply of large quantities of drugs.
	
	
	Lakatos DCJ accepted that none of the drugs the subject of the charges reached the community but gave little weight to this fact.
	
	
	The Applicant was born in October 1991. He had no criminal record and his Honour observed that “he was, until this time a person of good character”. After leaving school after year 12 the Applicant had been employed in a family business and regarded as a good employee. He had been living at home with his parents and two siblings in a supportive environment. His Honour accepted that the Applicant on release from custody would continue to have the support of his family and, provided that support structure continued and the Applicant maintained his efforts at rehabilitation, there was little need for specific deterrence. His Honour found that the Applicant was remorseful and observed that he had a very strong subjective case.
	
	
	Placed before Lakatos DCJ were a number of impressive references including from a counsellor of the GETTINGSMART Program and a probation officer. His Honour quoted from a psychologist’s report that he said accorded with his own impression:
	


The offender’s behaviour is best understood within the context of ‘a man who was young and immature and was engaging in a hedonistic lifestyle that seemingly normalised his use of illicit drugs’. Moreover, his involvement in a subculture of individuals who engaged in substance abuse seems to have influenced his sense of social power and contributed to his offending behaviour. The combination of his immaturity, hedonistic traits and social power, adversely impacted upon his judgment such that he failed to recognise the long term consequences of offending.


	
	However, prior to his arrest the Applicant had acquired addictions. His alcohol intake was excessive. He was using cannabis on a daily basis, ecstasy each weekend and had started using cocaine just before his arrest. He had a heavy gambling habit. The Applicant explained his dealing as engaged in to support these addictions. His Honour recorded that since his arrest the Applicant had taken significant steps to deal with the factors that had resulted in his offending.
	
	
	The Applicant was arrested on 1 May 2012 and pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity for which a 25% discount was allowed.
	
	
	There are two grounds of appeal:
	



	
	The sentence is manifestly excessive.
	
	
	The sentences imposed on the Applicant give rise to a legitimate sense of grievance when compared with the sentences imposed on his up-line suppliers and co-offenders, Mr Colakoglu and Mr Dodd.
	


Ground 1

The sentence is manifestly excessive.


	
	The argument in support of the first ground proceeded principally by way of comparison with two previous decisions – R v Ehrlich [2012] NSWCCA 38, 219 A Crim R 415 and R v Lipton [2012] NSWDC 201, a decision of Finnane DCJ referred to by the Court of Criminal Appeal in Parris v R [2013] NSWCCA 5. Lakatos DCJ had remarked that it was useful to compare the circumstances present in R v Ehrlich with those of the Applicant, remarking also that the objective seriousness of the facts in R v Ehrlich was significantly higher than in the present case. His Honour took a similar view of the circumstances in R v Lipton.
	
	
	The sentence imposed on Ehrlich for the supply of 1.615 kg of methylamphetamine was a non-parole period of 4 years and 10 months with a balance of term of 1 year 8 months. The sentence reflected discounts of 25% for a guilty plea and 10% for assistance. This court dismissed an appeal against the inadequacy of the sentence. Adams J, with whose view in this respect Basten JA agreed, while holding that the sentence was not manifestly inadequate, said that the circumstances would have justified a starting point significantly higher. Johnson J regarded the sentence as manifestly inadequate and the sentence that should have been imposed was one of 9 years and 3 months including a non-parole period of 6 years and 9 months
	
	
	Lipton was sentenced in respect of two offences – one of supplying a large commercial quantity being 586.9 g (not much more than the minimum large commercial quantity) of ecstasy and one of supplying a large commercial quantity being 1.905 kg (almost double the minimum large commercial quantity) of cocaine. The effective sentence imposed was of a non-parole period of imprisonment of 4 years and 6 months with a balance of term of 3 years and 6 months, these periods being arriving at after a discount of 25% for his plea. Finnane DCJ had remarked that Lipton involved himself in the quantities involved in these offences because a Police Officer had sought that supply.
	
	
	Counsel for the Applicant conceded that the applicant was not entitled to a lesser sentence simply because he compared favourably to two decided cases where the offender received a lesser sentence. However it was submitted that because Lakatos DCJ had found those cases “of assistance” he must have found they were “sufficiently comparable to assess the appropriate sentencing range”. It was further submitted that to impose a more severe sentence upon the Applicant than the sentences imposed on the other offenders whose cases were more unfavourable was demonstrative of error.
	
	
	I do not agree. To say that two other cases are of assistance does not involve an acceptance that they set a, or as is implicit in the submissions, the standard against which any other sentence is to be judged. Despite the concession to which I have just referred the argument amounts to a simple comparison between two selected cases and the situation of the Applicant. There are innumerable decisions where this Court has repudiated such an approach.
	
	
	Adding back the discount that the Applicant was given, the commencing point for the total sentence imposed on the first offence was 10 years. Compared against the guide posts of life imprisonment and 15 years as a standard non-parole period, it is not obvious this starting point is unreasonable or plainly unjust. As has been said, the quantity involved was over twice the minimum that brought the Applicant’s offence into the large commercial range. And while he undoubtedly had a strong subjective case, his criminality was deliberate, repeated, and done for financial gain even if the need for that gain was the Applicants’ own addiction. Against such offending, his prior good character – if that was an accurate assessment given his drug use and knowledge prior to first meeting the undercover officer that he knew “a fair few guys” that can get different drugs cheaply – is of limited weight.
	
	
	Albeit measured against different guide posts, similar remarks can be made in respect of the sentences imposed for the second and third offences.
	
	
	Sentencing is a discretionary exercise. There is no single right sentence. The remarks in R v Ehrlich that the circumstances in that case would have justified a significantly higher starting point demonstrate that the sentence imposed on the Applicant was not manifestly excessive. So do numerous other cases including some that were cited in R v Ehrlich such as R v Mahmud [2010] NSWCCA 219, circa [77]. See also R v Sciberras [2006] NSWCCA 268, 165 A Crim R 532 circa [58]. (Lest it be thought that the matter has been overlooked, I acknowledge that to some degree these cases may reflect an approach to the standard non-parole period since rejected by the High Court in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120. However they provide sufficient of a guide for present purposes.)
	
	
	The first ground of appeal fails.
	


Ground Two

The sentences imposed on the Applicant give rise to a legitimate sense of grievance when compared with the sentences imposed on his up-line suppliers and co-offenders, Mr Colakoglu and Mr Dodd.


	
	An overview of the offending of the three offenders and the sentences imposed on them is as follows:
	


Mr Whitby was dealt with for three offences, supplying a total of 1,182 g of MDMA, 807 g of methylamphetamine and 72 g of methorphan and sentenced to imprisonment for 8 years including a non-parole period of 4 years and 9 months.

Mr Colakoglu was dealt with for one offence, supplying a total of 1,573 g of MDMA and sentenced to imprisonment for 7 years 6 months including a non-parole period of 4 years and 3 months.

Mr Dodd was dealt with for four offences, supplying 1,288 g of MDMA and 74 g of methorphan and sentenced to imprisonment for 8 years and 3 months including a non-parole period of 5 years.


	
	Mr Whitby’s principal offence was, as has been said, supplying 1182.56 g of MDMA. Mr Dodd’s principal offence was supplying 944.3 g of MDMA. For these offences both received the same sentence as that imposed on Mr Colakoglu, all three having received a 25% discount for their pleas. The gravamen of the complaint made under this ground is that Lakatos DCJ, who sentenced all three offenders, did not make adequate allowance for the different circumstances of their offending and their subjective characteristics.
	
	
	Mr Colakoglu’s offence was constituted by the supply of approximately 645 g of 16.5% purity on 21 February 2012 and approximately 628 g of 18% purity on 27 March of that year. The first supply was to Mr Dodd who then supplied the drugs to Mr Whitby. The second supply was intended to follow a similar form but was interrupted by police. Taken into account was an offence of supplying on a third occasion a commercial quantity, namely 298.7 g of 21% purity of ecstasy, again to Mr Dodd who on-sold the drug to Mr Whitby. Mr Colakoglu made a profit of approximately $2 - at one stage his Honour said “about $1 to $2 per pill - for each of the pills he sold to Mr Dodd. His Honour recorded that as far as could be calculated, Mr Colakoglu’s profit was $8,000.
	
	
	Mr Colakoglu was 21 at the time of sentence and had no prior convictions, although he had in August 2011 been placed on two section 10 bonds for assault. He had attended school until year 10, completing his secondary education at TAFE, done courses on the Responsible Service of Alcohol and Conduct of Gaming and obtained a Security Licence. During the sentencing hearing Mr Colakoglu was supported by a number of favourable references, including to the effect that he retained the support of his father.
	
	
	He had experimented with a number of drugs although his drug of choice was 15 to 30 ecstasy tablets a week.
	
	
	Mr Colakoglu sought to explain his offending by asserting that prior to the offending charged he had not been engaged in any such supply of large quantities and had only done so reluctantly and because of his friendship with Mr Dodd and information from the latter than he had been threatened. His Honour did not find this account convincing but did accept that Mr Colakoglu had been reluctant to supply Mr Dodd on each occasion. His Honour also accepted that Mr Colakoglu was remorseful and expressed the opinion that, with assistance, Mr Colakoglu’s prospects of rehabilitation should be “optimistic”.
	
	
	In sentencing Mr Colakoglu, Lakatos DCJ made the point that Mr Colakoglu was not being sentenced for any offence other than that charged. His Honour was conscious of the sentence he had imposed on Mr Whitby, the latter’s circumstances and the similarity and differences between the two offenders. His Honour remarked that while both offenders had little or no criminal history, Mr Colakoglu had been on conditional liberty, that the quantities of drugs involved in the charges against him were less and the number of charges faced fewer than in Mr Whitby’s case. His Honour accepted that Mr Colakoglu was higher in the hierarchy but said that having regard to the quantities of drugs and that each offender made a modest profit this was not a matter of great significance. At one stage his Honour said that Mr Colakoglu was “one of those at the top of the hierarchy” but given that there was no reference by his Honour to how or those from whom Mr Colakoglu obtained drugs, this remark would appear to relate to only the offenders named in these reasons. His Honour remarked that the objective gravity of Mr Colakoglu’s offence and the first of Mr Whitby’s was not substantially different and expressed the view that the differences between them largely cancelled each other out except for the greater number of offences to which Mr Whitby had pleaded guilty.
	
	
	Mr Dodd was sentenced in respect of four offences:
	



	
	supplying between 24 January and 21 February 2012 not less than a large commercial quantity being 944.3 g of ecstasy;
	
	
	between 28 January and 6 February 2012 supplying not less than an indictable quantity being 74 g of methorphan;
	
	
	Between 18 and 25 February 2012 supplying not less than a commercial quantity being 223.02 g of ecstasy;
	
	
	between 16 January and 26 February 2012 supplying not less than an indictable quantity being 111.0608 g of ecstasy.
	



	
	The sentences imposed were respectively:
	



	
	imprisonment for 7 years and 6 months including a non-parole period of 4 years and 3 months;
	
	
	imprisonment for a fixed term of 2 years;
	
	
	imprisonment for 3 years including a non-parole period of 2 years and 3 months;
	
	
	imprisonment for 3 years including a non-parole period of 2 years and 3 months.
	



	
	As is apparent from Mr Dodd’s effective sentence being one of imprisonment for 8 years and 3 months including a non-parole period of 5 years, there was a deal of concurrency of the sentences.
	
	
	Mr Dodd’s first offence involved supply of drugs on three occasions to Mr Whitby. The fourth offence involved six instances of supply, only one of which was to Mr Whitby. The other offences did not seem to involve Mr Whitby. Mr Dodd had no Form 1 offence to be taken into account.
	
	
	Lakatos DCJ noted that when arrested Mr Dodd had four phones in false names. His Honour described Mr Dodd as one level above Mr Whitby and a middle man for the supply of large quantities of drugs encouraged by an undercover police officer but also a supplier to consumers. His Honour remarked on Mr Dodd’s position in the hierarchy and that he had a wider circle of customers and more extensive network, a fact his Honour said should be reflected in sentence. Mr Dodd’s primary motive was found to be financial gain.
	
	
	Mr Dodd was born in May 1999. He obtained his school certificate and completed a bricklaying apprenticeship and was said to have an excellent work ethic. He retained the support of his family and his previous employer said that he would re-employ Mr Dodd on his release. However Mr Dodd had a significantly worse record than the others, including convictions for mid-range PCA, offensive language and re-entering licensed premises, assault and assault occasioning actual bodily harm, and contravening an apprehended violence order. He had not previously been sentenced to imprisonment. He had become a binge drinker and became addicted to ecstasy, progressing to the habitual use of amphetamines and cocaine.
	
	
	Lakatos DCJ observed that Mr Dodd was remorseful and with guardedly reasonable prospects of rehabilitation.
	
	
	In sentencing Mr Dodd, his Honour remarked that the differences between 994, 1182 and 1274 g were perhaps not significant but noted that Mr Dodd was on conditional liberty and faced four charges, albeit over a shorter period than Mr Whitby’s offending. His Honour observed that there were significant elements of parity which applied but Mr Dodd’s more extensive supply network warranted a slightly greater overall sentence.
	
	
	The gravamen of the attack on the fact that the Applicant had received for his most serious offence the same sentence that Mr Colakoglu had received was that the Applicant had not been given credit for the favourable findings of naivety and inexperience in dealing with large quantities, his lowly role in the hierarchy, his transient possession of the drugs and money, the undercover police officer’s encouraging of the Applicant’s offending, his very limited profits, his drug addiction and very strong subjective case.
	
	
	Some of these matters do argue in the Applicant’s favour although Mr Colakoglu had a respectable subjective case and also seems to have had a drug addiction. His Honour concluded that Mr Colakoglu’s reward was more than the Applicant’s but, given that he would not seem to have been a principal, the fact that he made more per pill is not obviously a factor entitled to significant weight. Certainly Mr Colakoglu would seem to have had freer access than the Applicant to large quantities but the Applicant’s statement to the undercover police officer to the effect that knew “a fair few guys that can get different drugs cheaply” cannot be ignored. And while the Applicant seems to have yielded to the persuasion of the undercover officer, Mr Colakoglu seems also to have had some reluctance that was overcome. In any event as Lakatos DCJ made clear when sentencing Mr Colakoglu, the offenders were sentenced for the offences charged, not for the offences they might have been able to effect. In terms of the character of the first offence of the Applicant and that of Mr Colakoglu there was not much difference between the offenders.
	
	
	As I have said, some of the matters relied on do argue in the Applicant’s favour but the weight to be given to them is another matter. For example, his Honour was well entitled to conclude that the different positions of the two offenders in the hierarchy was not a matter of great significance. The “hierarchy” in this case was significantly different from that commonly prevailing where there are principals or bosses or organisers and one or more layers of underlings.
	
	
	In a comparison with Mr Dodd, attention was drawn to Mr Dodd’s more extensive supply network and apparent ease in accommodating the request for larger quantities and greater financial gain. It was pointed out that Mr Dodd had had a significant criminal history and had been on conditional liberty and his Honour’s remarks that Mr Dodd’s criminal history was “slightly worse” and that their different positions in the hierarchy was “not an overly significant matter” were criticised. It was submitted that the difference in sentences failed to give proper recognition to the difference in their subjective cases.
	
	
	Again there are undoubtedly some factors that argue in favour of the view that there should have been a difference in the sentences imposed for their first offences and a greater difference in their overall sentences. However the factors relied on on behalf of the Applicant are not the only ones relevant. I would myself have regarded the 25% greater quantity involved in the Applicant’s first offence as compared with Mr Dodd’s as arguing for some increase in penalty and the difference between the total quantities – in the case of the Applicant 1990 g (albeit of different drugs) and in the case of Mr Dodd 1288 g – as certainly doing so.
	
	
	As I have said, sentencing is a discretionary exercise. It is not an exact science. Different minds are liable to give different weight to different factors. As Garling J said in Rees v R [2012] NSWCCA 47 at [50]:
	


Because the function of imposing a sentence on an individual has a discretionary character, an appellate court will ordinarily be reluctant to intervene. There is no such thing as perfect consistency in sentencing. A search for perfect consistency is to look for the unattainable and will frequently be an exercise of academic abstraction: Postiglione at 336-7 per Kirby J, R v M (CA) (1996) 105 CCC (3d) 327 at [92] per Lamer CJ.


	
	His Honour went on to refer to those cases which emphasise that before a court will interfere on parity grounds with a sentence otherwise proper, it requires that there be a “marked” or “clearly unjustifiable” disparity in the sentences under comparison. See also Dwayhi v R [2011] NSWCCA 67, 205 A Crim R 274 at [23] per Johnson J with whom the other members of the Court agreed. Furthermore, ,“A court of criminal appeal deciding an appeal against the severity of a sentence on the ground of unjustified disparity will have regard to the qualitative and discretionary judgments required of the primary judge in drawing distinctions between co-offenders.” – Green and Quinn v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; (2011) 244 CLR 462 at [32].
	
	
	In sentencing all three offenders Lakatos DCJ was conscious of their roles, similarities and differences but thought that the same sentence was appropriate for their most serious – in the case of Mr Colakoglu only – offences. While I can accept that other minds might not have taken exactly the same view as his Honour, I am not persuaded that in respect of that matter his Honour erred. Nor do I regard the relativity between the overall sentences as so great as to be erroneous.
	
	
	Accordingly this second ground also fails.
	
	
	I propose that the Court make the following orders:
	



	
	Grant leave to appeal.
	
	
	Dismiss the appeal.

2703358,Kim v R [2015] NSWCCA 115,"Judgment


	
	HOEBEN CJ at CL: I agree with R A Hulme J. In relation to the CCTV footage which the Court viewed, my conclusions are the same as those of his Honour. I also share his Honour’s doubts as to the reliability of the applicant as a witness.
	
	
	R A HULME J: Anthony Kim (“the applicant”) pleaded guilty in the Local Court to an offence of recklessly causing grievous bodily harm in company and was sentenced in the District Court by his Honour Judge North on 9 May 2014 to imprisonment for 3 years with a non-parole period of 1 year 6 months.
	
	
	The offence is contrary to s 35(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). The maximum penalty is imprisonment for 14 years. There is also a standard non-parole period prescribed in the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) of 5 years.
	
	
	The applicant seeks leave to appeal against conviction on the following ground:
	


The acceptance by the court of the Applicant’s plea has resulted in a miscarriage of justice.


	
	A proposed appeal against sentence was abandoned at the hearing of the application.
	


Facts


	
	The facts of the applicant’s offence were set out in a document tendered without objection before the primary judge. The document was headed “Agreed Statement of Facts”. The following has been drawn from it.
	
	
	The victim of the offence, Mr Ananh Songvilay, was on the dance floor at the Verandah Bar in Elizabeth Street, Sydney at about 2.40am on Sunday 9 December 2012. A man called Joseph Shin (who was sentenced at the same time as the applicant) approached him from behind, grabbed his shoulder causing him to turn around and then punched him in the face. This caused Mr Songvilay to fall to the ground. It was part of the agreed facts that this assault was unprovoked.
	
	
	The applicant, who had been standing about five metres away, saw this and immediately walked over and kicked Mr Songvilay in the face as he was lying on the ground. The applicant then punched him three times to the face. Mr Songvilay was unconscious at the time he did so.
	
	
	The applicant was dragged away by security guards who detained him. An ambulance was called and Mr Songvilay was taken to hospital. Police attended and arrested the applicant. He told them, “I kicked a guy in the head”.
	
	
	The applicant participated in a recorded interview at a police station. He was asked to explain what had happened and he said, “I saw a fight and then a guy on the floor. I kicked him in the head”. He was asked how hard he kicked the victim and he said, “Like a soccer ball”. He also admitted leaning down and punching the victim and when asked how hard he replied, “As hard as I could”. When asked why he had assaulted the victim he said, “I thought it would get attention. I might look cool”. The agreed facts included that this assault was unprovoked.
	
	
	The applicant also told police that at the same time that he was assaulting Mr Songvilay there were other people kicking him.
	
	
	The applicant told police that he had been drinking and that his level of intoxication at the time of the incident was “high”.
	
	
	Mr Songvilay sustained a number of injuries. They included bruising to his cheek and around his right eye; swollen eyes and lips; the loss of several teeth; a fracture to the inner wall of his eye socket; a fracture of the bone around two missing teeth; and a tooth pushed back into the jaw with a fracture to the surrounding bone in the lower jaw. The opinion of a dental surgeon was that due to the severity of the trauma, Mr Songvilay will likely have long term dental problems such as fracture of teeth, root canal therapy and temporal mandibular disorder.
	


Evidence for the applicant

The CCTV footage


	
	During the course of the hearing of the application, senior counsel for the applicant played the CCTV footage of the incident in question. Prior to it being played he referred to the applicant's admission that others were involved in striking the victim and said ""we would argue that the CCTV footage tends to suggest exactly the opposite"". This was said to be relevant to the quality of the advice the applicant was given by his solicitor. The Court viewed the footage both in real time and in slow motion. I have viewed it again a number of times in chambers. For my part, the vision is so poor in depicting what occurred after the initial punch by Mr Shin when the victim went to the ground that nothing useful can be drawn from it; it certainly does not ""suggest exactly the opposite"" of what the applicant admitted in his police interview.
	


The applicant's affidavit


	
	An affidavit sworn by the applicant on 17 December 2014 was the primary evidentiary basis for the ground of appeal against conviction asserting that acceptance of his plea of guilty gave rise to a miscarriage of justice.
	
	
	In that affidavit the applicant said that he first retained Martin Ricci, Solicitor, in late December 2012 or early January 2013. Mr Ricci came to act for Joseph Shin as well. The applicant claimed that he thought they were both charged with the same offence. He said he received a copy of the brief of evidence which included CCTV footage from Mr Ricci in late March or early April 2013. He only read about five pages of the brief because it made him depressed. He did not watch the CCTV footage.
	
	
	In a conference with Mr Ricci on or about 23 August 2013 he was told, “We have to plead guilty to the charge of ‘recklessly causing grievous bodily harm in company’ because of what you said to the police in the interview”. Mr Ricci gave him a draft statement of facts and said something to the effect that he would try and have some aspects of it removed. The applicant claimed that he was never “one hundred per cent sure of what was going on” but he “accepted Mr Ricci’s advice without question”.
	
	
	The applicant claimed that Mr Ricci did not discuss with him or provide advice on what “in company” meant or what “recklessly causing grievous bodily harm” meant. He claims that they also did not discuss the offence to which Mr Shin was pleading guilty. He claimed that he thought the “in company” aspect of the charge he faced was a reference to him being in company with Mr Shin; he did not appreciate that it meant in company with other people. He said that he was never advised what “grievous bodily harm” and “actual bodily harm” meant and he did not know that in pleading guilty he would be admitting to having caused all of the serious injuries sustained by the victim with other unknown people.
	
	
	The applicant also claimed that he was never advised that he had an option to plead not guilty. He was advised to plead guilty and he agreed to do that.
	
	
	The applicant attended the Downing Centre Local Court on 27 August 2013. Mr Ricci represented both him and Mr Shin. The applicant recalled the magistrate reading out the charge and Mr Ricci entering the plea of guilty for him to the charge of recklessly inflicting grievous bodily harm in company. (Presumably he heard the different charge read out to which Shin pleaded guilty.)
	
	
	The applicant said that during one of the occasions that the matter was mentioned in the District Court after he was committed for sentence, he learnt that Mr Shin was to be sentenced for assault occasioning actual bodily harm. He said he did not understand why he was to be sentenced for a less serious charge as he had believed that they were both charged with causing the same injuries to the victim in the company of each other. However, he did not ask Mr Ricci about this as he trusted that he was doing everything which was in his interest.
	
	
	The applicant recounted some aspects of the progress of the proceedings which are not presently relevant. Ultimately, Mr Eric Oates of counsel was briefed by Mr Ricci to appear for the applicant and Mr Shin at the sentence hearing.
	
	
	On 9 May 2014 the applicant had a conference with Mr Oates in his chambers prior to court. He said there was no discussion about the agreed statement of facts and nor was he asked to sign it. There was no discussion as to whether he adhered to his plea of guilty or what that meant. He said he was advised not to give evidence.
	
	
	The applicant claimed that it was only after he was sentenced that he understood that it was on the basis that he had acted “in company” with unknown people and that together they had caused grievous bodily harm.
	


Cross-examination of the applicant


	
	The applicant agreed that prior to being sentenced he had achieved his Higher School Certificate and was undertaking study for a Diploma of Commerce at university.
	
	
	A continuing theme throughout the cross-examination of the applicant was his asserted inability to recall. He claimed an inability to recall aspects of the events concerning the assault upon Mr Songvilay and his participation in an interview with police. He could not even remember that Mr Shin was the first person to strike Mr Songvilay; although he ""believed"" he was involved in the assault. When certain passages of the interview were read to him he claimed that he still could not recall.
	
	
	Despite his poor recollection, he was able to deny that others were kicking Mr Songvilay as he was kicking and punching him. He was also adamant that he did not know and had never met Mr Songvilay. The Pre-Sentence Report records that he said that ""the victim of the offence was known to him as they had been co-workers"" but he claimed ""that's not true"".
	
	
	The applicant was then asked about whether he had told Mr Tim Watson-Munro, the author of a psychological report that was tendered at the sentencing hearing, that he had a problem with the victim concerning a girl. At first he referred to his poor memory because ""I've just been trying to forget about it"", but when further pressed he agreed that the victim was known to him. He agreed that when he told police the contrary he had lied.
	
	
	The applicant claimed that he did not know what a ""custodial sentence"" was. He was asked about having signed instructions to Mr Ricci on 27 August 2013 confirming his plea of guilty which included, ""I understand that the sentence I will receive for these matters will be a custodial sentence"". He claimed that he signed the document without having read it and reiterated, ""I didn't even know what a 'custodial sentence' was"". I note that he referred elsewhere in his evidence to conversations with Mr Ricci about the prospects of going to gaol. He contradicted his earlier evidence when he said that he remembered Mr Ricci's clerk telling him in a telephone conversation that ""you are likely to face a custodial sentence"".
	
	
	The applicant was asked about having a conference with Mr Oates on the morning of the sentence hearing. It was suggested that Mr Oates had said that ""the fact that you had assaulted the victim while there were other people also assaulting him was one of the matters the court would take into account"" and he agreed. But then, somewhat curiously, he said that he found out after he went to gaol that Mr Oates was not actually representing him on that day.
	


Evidence for the Crown


	
	The Crown read an affidavit affirmed by Mr Ricci. Mr Oates of counsel was called to give oral evidence.
	


Mr Ricci's evidence


	
	Mr Ricci has been a solicitor practicing almost exclusively in criminal law for over 20 years. He assumed carriage of the applicant's matter in early January 2013. He said that at the outset he explained to the applicant each element of the offence of recklessly causing grievous bodily harm in company. Specifically, he explained what ""grievous bodily harm"" was. He explained that the ""in company"" element was made out by the admission to police by the applicant that ""whilst he was assaulting the victim, he observed other unknown people kicking the victim"". It was his view that there was an implied ""common purpose"" to cause harm to the victim.
	
	
	Mr Ricci said that he explained to the applicant that ""recklessness"" according to the common law required foresight of the possibility of grievous bodily harm resulting from the assault. (That was in accordance with Blackwell v R [2011] NSWCCA 93; 81 NSWLR 119 but s 35 of the Crimes Act was amended with effect from 21 June 2012 as a result of that decision so as to only require (for the purpose of the offence in question) foresight of causing actual bodily harm.)
	
	
	Mr Ricci said that he had several conversations with the applicant throughout the proceedings concerning the nature and effect of the admissions he had made to the police as set out in the police statement of facts. That statement of facts set out in summary form a description of the serious injuries the victim sustained and included the applicant’s admission to police that there were other people assaulting the victim at the same time as the applicant was.
	
	
	Mr Ricci assessed the applicant as an intelligent young man. He claimed that the applicant reassured him on numerous occasions that he understood the charge he was facing; its seriousness; and that he was facing an almost certain custodial sentence.
	
	
	The applicant was provided with a copy of the brief of evidence on 20 May 2013. It included DVDs containing CCTV footage from the Verandah Bar. Mr Ricci said that the applicant subsequently confirmed that he had read the brief and viewed the footage. He recalled the applicant remarking that he found it ""very hard to watch"" because he was so embarrassed about his behavior.
	
	
	Mr Ricci had a conference with the applicant on 27 August 2013 in which he was instructed to confirm the plea of guilty. Annexed to Mr Ricci's affidavit were the applicant's signed instructions bearing that date. They included that ""the consequences and ramifications of these instructions have been explained to me by … Martin Ricci""; that the applicant had ""carefully considered all of [his] alternatives""; and that he had discussed the matter with friends and ""comprehensively with Martin Ricci"". He also stated that he understood that he would receive a custodial sentence.
	
	
	The matter was first listed in the District Court before the Chief Judge on 6 September 2013. The plea of guilty was confirmed and the matter was stood over for sentence on 29 November 2013. There followed a series of applications to vacate hearing dates until ultimately the matter came before North DCJ on 9 May 2014. The delays were explained on the bases of the applicant being tardy in providing funds for his representation and the need to obtain a psychological report.
	
	
	In the weeks leading up to 9 May 2014 the applicant was assisted by a law clerk employed by Mr Ricci to gather references and to prepare an ""apology letter to the judge"". The law clerk attended upon counsel in a conference with the applicant on the morning before he appeared before North DCJ. Mr Ricci claimed (from having been informed by his clerk) that counsel discussed with the applicant that he had pleaded guilty to a charge of recklessly causing grievous bodily harm and that he was highly likely to receive a custodial sentence. As Mr Shin was present at the same conference, it is reasonable to infer that counsel spoke about his, lesser, charge of assault occasioning actual bodily harm.
	
	
	In cross-examination, senior counsel for the applicant took Mr Ricci through a legal analysis of what must be established to prove that an offence was committed ""in company"". (The questions were quite obviously derived from the judgment of Macfarlan JA in Markou v R [2012] NSWCCA 64; 221 A Crim R 48 at [24]-[25].) Mr Ricci's responses indicated that he had a correct understanding of the concept. He did not provide the applicant with a technical legal analysis of it but said ""I think he understood quite clearly what [in] company meant"".
	


Evidence of Eric Oates


	
	Mr Oates' direct involvement with the applicant was limited to his conference on the morning of 9 May 2014 and subsequent appearance before North DCJ. He described the applicant as ""aware, articulate and attentive"". He said that he had some typed notes of the submissions he intended to make on sentence which he supplemented with handwritten notations made during the conference. These included against typed notes referring to ""actual violence"" and ""in company"" as being potential aggravating factors (per s 21A(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act),  the handwritten note ""but none really as offends De Simoni"" (a reference to The Queen v De Simoni [1981] HCA 31; 147 CLR 383). From this Mr Oates considered that he believed he did discuss the ""in company"" aspect of the charge with the applicant.
	
	
	In cross-examination, Mr Oates said, ""I can't imagine I didn't discuss with [the applicant] the nature of the act and the fact that it was committed in company as being a reason for my assessment that he would probably be imprisoned"". He did not, however, discuss what the prosecution were required to prove in respect of the essential elements of the charge, particularly, being ""in company"".
	


The applicant's police interview


	
	The Crown relied upon certain responses given by the applicant in his police interview as (a) confirming that the ""in company"" element of the charge was well-founded in the applicant's own account; and (b) supporting the prudence of the advice given by Mr Ricci. His answers included the following (commencing with his answer to question 30):
	


""(W)hat I saw was just a um, just a lot of heads turning and then I looked and then um, there was just a fistfight. The guy was on the floor. Um, couple of Asian were around him and, yes, everyone was looking and, you know, I thought … some attention, pretty much. So I thought I'd just, just join.

Q31 Could you just, sorry, just explain that last bit you said to me then.

Q. 32 You wanted some attention?

A. Yeah.

Q33 What do you mean by that?

A. Um, I thought it'd be cool to sort of, you know, get in a fight, you know, just with everyone watching me and um, I just thought it'd be cool, be a good idea, you know, just with everyone watching me, just, yeah.

Q34 And what do you think would happen if people saw you in that fight?

A. Um, people maybe think I'm cool.

Q35 Yeah?

A. Maybe um, you know, they see me, they're like, Oh, that guy got in a fight, you know, or maybe, I don't know, have some respect, I guess.

Q36 Mmm. Um, you said ah, can you describe who was involved in this fight - - -

A. Um - - -

A. There was a girl who was screaming. Um, all I remember was, I don't know, I think, I just remember bunch of guys just kicking the guy on the floor.

…

Q41 … Ok, and you saw him on the floor. What was happening when he was on the floor?

A. Um, he was getting kicked.

Q42 Yeah. How many people were kicking?

A. I'm not too sure. Maybe four people, five people.

Q43 Could you describe any of those people who were kicking him?A. Um, one guy was tall. I don't know. I only saw a tall guy and a girl, They were screaming.

Q44 Were all of these people Asian appearance?

A. Yeah.

Q45 Ok. You said they were kicking a guy on the floor. Can, could you tell me what this guy on the floor was doing?

A. No, he was just getting kicked.

…

Q51 Yeah, ok. So he's on the floor. Um, a male who you can't describe any further um, he's been kicked by ah, another, a number of other people. Just describe exactly what you've done then.

A. Um, well, I see, I seen the fight break out and I don't know what came over me but I was drunk, I was a bit angry at the events that happened that night … and then um, just the, just the fight broke out and then I went over and then, 'cause everyone was watching and … I just looked at him and then kicked him in the head.

…

Q69 Ok. Were, just describe what he, how he was positioned as he lay there?

…

A. He was um, laying like this and I was here and his face was here and then I looked down at him and then he seen, 'cause he was getting kicked as well and then that's when I, I kicked him. (Emphasis added)

Pre-Sentence Report


	
	The Pre-Sentence Report tendered in the sentence hearing included that the applicant ""disagreed with the Statement of Facts in two respects"". The ""two respects"" concerned whether he knew the victim and the degree of his (the applicant's) level of intoxication. He did not express any disagreement with the ""agreed fact"" that ""whilst he was assaulting the victim, he observed other unknown people kicking the victim"".

	In written submissions to this Court prepared by junior counsel for the applicant it was contended that the failure of the applicant’s lawyers to explain to him the nature of the offence meant that he did not understand what it was that he was pleading guilty to. The plea was entered on his behalf by his lawyers without them ever having obtained instructions from him detailing his version of events or an explanation for what he said in his police interview. It was submitted that it was clear from the applicant’s affidavit evidence that he did not understand what he was pleading guilty to and therefore could not have entertained a genuine consciousness of guilt.
	
	
	It was submitted that there were triable issues with respect to causation and particularly whether or not the victim received the injuries which are said to amount to grievous bodily harm as a result of being punched to the ground by Shin or whether it was as a result of Shin kicking the victim once he was on the ground or as a result of the assault by unknown offenders. (This submission was abandoned at the hearing.)
	
	
	It was submitted that there was a further triable issue as to whether the applicant was “in company” with unknown persons and acted in concert with them. That is, whether there was an unspoken understanding or an arrangement amounting to an agreement between strangers to commit the offence.
	
	
	In oral submissions, the issue was confined to the adequacy and correctness of the advice given by Mr Ricci concerning the ""in company"" element. Specifically, it was contended that there should have been advice given that there ""could be an issue"" about the Crown's ability to prove this element. Senior counsel argued that R v Markou, supra, at [24]-[25], [28] and [33]-[34] set out the principles that should have been the subject of discussion and advice to the applicant.
	
	
	It was submitted that there was a potential issue about this because the applicant had not said in his police interview that his reason for being in the fight was to participate in the ""clobbering"" of the victim. It was not enough that the applicant had joined in the assault; his position was that he involved himself for his own personal reasons. Cited as an example was his response to Q30 which included the admission that he participated because he wanted ""some attention"".
	
	
	A submission was also made that the CCTV footage showed that the applicant was ""inaccurate"" when he said that other people were involved in the assault after Shin had left. The medical evidence was said to support this proposition.
	
	
	Senior counsel for the Crown submitted that the advice provided to the applicant by Mr Ricci was entirely correct and appropriate and the plea was entered with full knowledge of the elements of the offence. The facts to which the applicant had agreed in his police interview were that the applicant's friend, Shin, first punched the victim who fell to the floor and the applicant and other people then joined in to assault him further. An implicit common purpose was clearly established. The applicant told the author of the Pre-Sentence Report that he agreed with such an account which was set out in the ""Agreed Statement of Facts"".
	
	
	It was submitted for the Crown that Mr Ricci's evidence should be preferred to that of the applicant. The applicant's evidence was described as “unbelievable”; he was not making a genuine effort to answer questions in cross-examination. His claims of having difficulties in recalling matters and to having not understood matters were inconsistent with a person of the applicant's education and linguistic abilities.
	


Principles applicable to an appeal against conviction after a plea of guilty


	
	There are many judgments of this Court in which the principles applicable to an appeal against conviction following a plea of guilty have been collected: see, for example, R v Liberti (1991) 55 A Crim R 120 at 121-2; R v Toro-Martinez [2000] NSWCCA 216; 114 A Crim R 533 at [21]-[27]; R v Hura [2001] NSWCCA 61; 121 A Crim R 472 at [32]-[33]; R v Van [2002] NSWCCA 148; 129 A Crim R 229 at [48]-[50]; Lawson v R [2011] NSWCCA 44 at [32]-[36]; Khamis v R [2014] NSWCCA 152 at [57]-[59].
	
	
	The starting point is that an asserted want of understanding of what was involved in a plea of guilty is approached with ""caution bordering on circumspection"" given that a plea is an admission of all of the legal ingredients of an offence and is the most cogent admission of guilt that can be made: R v Sagiv (1986) 22 A Crim R 73; and R v Liberti, supra.
	
	
	It is necessary for the applicant to establish that a miscarriage of justice has occurred: Meissner v The Queen [1995] HCA 41; 184 CLR 132 at 157. Without being exhaustive, that may be shown in circumstances where:
	


●   the applicant did not appreciate the nature of the charge to which the plea was entered: R v Ferrer-Esis (1991) 55 A Crim R 231 at 233; R v Iral [1999] NSWCCA 368; Meissner v The Queen, supra, at 157.

●   the applicant was not in possession of all of the facts and the plea was not attributable to a genuine consciousness or recognition of guilt: R v Murphy [1965] VR 187 at 191; R v Davies (Court of Criminal Appeal (NSW), 16 December 1993, unrep); R v Ganderton (Court of Criminal Appeal (NSW), 17 September 1998; unrep); and R v Favero [1999] NSWCCA 320.

●   there was a mistake or other circumstance affecting the integrity of the plea as an admission of guilt: R v Sagiv, supra; or where

●   the advice of the applicant's lawyer(s) was imprudent, inappropriate or incorrect: R v Wilkes [2001] NSWCCA 97; 122 A Crim R 310; R v Hawker [2005] NSWCCA 118.


	
	Hoeben CJ at CL observed in Khamis v R, supra, at [59] that ""any miscarriage of justice is to be found in the circumstances in which the applicant came to enter his plea. Ordinarily, this task is not an investigation of the applicant's guilt or innocence; rather it is an examination of the integrity of the plea of guilty itself"".
	


Determination


	
	The applicant's evidence was not such as to engender confidence that it could be accepted in preference to that of Mr Ricci as to what passed between them in terms of advice as to the applicant's plea. His claimed inability to recall many matters was uninspiring. His changing version about whether he knew the victim, and his claim that he did not know what a custodial sentence was, did not promote confidence in his veracity either. And his denial that others were kicking the victim as he was kicking and punching him flew in the face of his admission to the police that this in fact occurred.
	
	
	The applicant claimed that Mr Ricci never explained what ""grievous bodily harm"" and ""in company"" meant which I find difficult to believe. He said that he wanted to find out what they meant by ""Googling"" them but when the first website he was directed to did not provide the answer he just gave up. He did not claim that he ever asked Mr Ricci to explain the terms.
	
	
	The Court was taken to Markou v R, supra, for the purpose of providing a succinct summary of the meaning of ""in company"" as an element of a criminal offence. Mr Ricci indicated a confident and correct understanding of the principles. And, in my view, the element was clearly established in the applicant's version of events in the passages of his police interview quoted above (at [43]).
	
	
	The submission of senior counsel for the applicant that the advice given by Mr Ricci was deficient in not referring to there being a potential issue about the Crown's ability to prove the ""in company"" element cannot be accepted. The submission was more concerned with the applicant having personal reasons for involving himself in the assault upon the victim which is irrelevant. The fact is, on his own admission, others were assaulting the victim and he joined in. No more was required. Any challenge to the Crown's ability to prove the element would have been futile, given that the applicant did not indicate to Mr Ricci at any stage that he resiled from what he had admitted.
	
	
	The applicant has failed to establish that when he pleaded guilty, and adhered to his plea of guilty, he did not appreciate the nature of the charge; that he was not in possession of all of the relevant facts; that his plea was not attributable to a recognition of guilt; that there was something that adversely affected the integrity of the plea; or that the advice of his solicitor was in any relevant way at fault.
	
	
	I would grant leave to appeal but only because the matter was fully argued; it was devoid of merit. I would otherwise dismiss the appeal.
	


Orders


	
	I propose the following orders:
	


1.   Leave to appeal against conviction granted.

2.   Appeal dismissed.


	
	BEECH-JONES J: Subject to what follows I agree with the reasons and orders proposed by R A Hulme J.
	
	
	The written submissions filed on behalf of the applicant contended that his conviction amounts to a miscarriage of justice because he entered a plea of guilty to the offence of recklessly causing grievous bodily harm in company without him having provided his version of events to his legal representatives and without him having a proper understanding as to what “grievous bodily harm” or “in company” meant.
	
	
	The evidence of the applicant’s former solicitor, Mr Ricci, was to the effect that he discussed the version of the events given by the applicant to the police with the applicant in several conversations and that he explained the concept of grievous bodily harm to him. He also stated that he explained to the applicant that the “in company” element was made out by the applicant’s admissions to the police which were to the effect that he “join[ed]” other persons in kicking the victim while he was on the ground. Having had the opportunity to view both the applicant and Mr Ricci give evidence and to consider their evidence having regard to the “contemporary materials, objectively established facts and the apparent logic of events” (Fox v Percy [2003] HCA 22; 214 CLR 118 at [31] per Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Kirby JJ) I have no hesitation in accepting Mr Ricci’s evidence to the extent that it conflicts with the evidence of the applicant.
	
	
	Otherwise I agree with RA Hulme J that Mr Ricci was correct in his assessment that the “in company” element was made out by the applicant’s admissions to the police in his interview and that Mr Ricci correctly understood the effect of the discussion of that element in Markou v R [2012] NSWCCA 64; 221 A Crim R 48 at [24] to [25]. Further my viewing of the CCTV footage of the incident does not suggest that the events in the nightclub did not transpire in the manner told by the applicant to the police and nothing in that footage warranted any reappraisal by Mr Ricci of the advice he gave to the applicant.
	
	
	It follows that there is no basis for impugning the advice given to the applicant that lead to his entry of a plea of guilty and nor is there any basis for impugning that plea. No miscarriage of justice was occasioned by the applicant’s conviction.

		27 May 2015",2015-05-26 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2703366,KA v R [2015] NSWCCA 111,"Judgment


	
	MEAGHER JA: I agree with the orders proposed by Simpson J. Subject to the additional observations below, my reasons for doing so are the same as those given by her Honour. What follows assumes a familiarity with her Honour’s judgment.
	
	
	Ground 2 is concerned with the adequacy of the trial judge’s direction as to the appellant’s participation in a joint criminal enterprise with EZ in relation to the commission of the first offence charged.
	
	
	Each was charged that on 5 May 2012, being in the company of the other, he did have sexual intercourse with the complainant without her consent and knowing that she was not consenting.
	
	
	The Crown case (see Simpson J at [27]) was that although the act of forced fellatio was committed by EZ the appellant was equally guilty because the two of them acted in concert in pursuance of a common purpose that they would commit that crime. In such a case if “one or other of the parties to the understanding or arrangement does, or they do between them, in accordance with the continuing understanding or arrangement, all those things which are necessary to constitute the crime, they are all equally guilty of the crime regardless of the part played by each in its commission”: McAuliffe v The Queen [1995] HCA 37; 183 CLR 108 at 114.
	
	
	The doctrine of common purpose or joint criminal enterprise, as the High Court noted in Huynh v The Queen [2013] HCA 6; 87 ALJR 434 at [37], “provides the means of attaching liability for the agreed crime on all the parties to the agreement regardless of the part played by each in its execution”. In Huynh at [37], the Court also approved the explanation of the relevant principles given by McHugh J in Osland v The Queen [1998] HCA 75; 197 CLR 316 at [72] - [94]. That explanation in turn adopts as accurate the statement of this Court in R v Tangye (1997) 92 A Crim R 545 at 556 - 557, in the passage extracted in the judgment of Simpson J at [91].
	
	
	As was emphasised in Tangye at 556 - 557:
	


… The understanding or arrangement need not be express, and its existence may be inferred from all the circumstances. It need not have been reached at any time before the crime is committed. The circumstances in which two or more persons are participating together in the commission of a particular crime may themselves establish an unspoken understanding or arrangement amounting to an agreement formed between them then and there to commit that crime.


	
	The doctrine of joint criminal enterprise makes parties to an understanding equally liable for the acts that constitute the actus reus of the crime which is the subject of that understanding: Osland at [73] citing Tangye. That will be so notwithstanding that one party to the understanding does not commit any of those acts, provided that that party participates in some way in the commission of the crime. That requirement of participation will be satisfied if the person is present when the crime is committed in accordance with the continuing understanding: Osland at [27], [73]; Huynh at [37].
	
	
	It was also necessary for the Crown to establish that at the time the acts constituting the actus reus were committed, the appellant had the requisite mens rea: Osland at [79], [81], [93]; Likiardopoulos v The Queen [2012] HCA 37; 247 CLR 265 at [19]; McEwan, Dambitis & Robb v The Queen [2013] VSCA 329 at [35], [38].
	
	
	The elements of mens rea required under an offence provision similar to s 61J of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) were considered by the High Court in Gillard v The Queen [2014] HCA 16; 88 ALJR 606 (there s 54 of the Crimes Act 1900 (ACT) was in issue):
	


[27]   Regardless of how the prosecution proves the non-consent of the complainant, the mental element of the offence is satisfied by proof of the accused’s knowledge that the complainant was not consenting or proof that the accused was reckless as to the complainant’s consent….


	
	In R v Tyrone Chishimba [2010] NSWCCA 228, three persons were charged with an offence under s 61J in circumstances where the complainant was not able to identify which of the three accused (each of whom was present at the relevant time) had sexual intercourse with her. Counsel for one of the accused submitted that s 61R (since repealed and see now s 61HA(3)(b)) did not apply to the attribution of knowledge to a party to a joint enterprise who was not the actual perpetrator of the offence. Macfarlan JA (James J and McCallum J agreeing on this question) rejected this argument, observing at [169]:
	


The Crown’s case was that the appellants were participants in a joint enterprise to commit an offence against s 61J. If an appellant had the mental state (in this case knowledge or recklessness as to consent) that would have rendered him guilty of an offence against s 61R if he had been the actual perpetrator of the act, he was equally guilty if he was a participant in an agreement or understanding that the crime would be committed and not he, but another participant, was the actual perpetrator. This is the effect of the principles expounded by McHugh J in Osland.

(The reference to s 61R must be understood as being to the offence against s 61J charged by count 1).


	
	Here the Crown case was that the understanding between the appellant and EZ, and the appellant’s guilty state of mind were to be inferred from the relevant events leading up to the commission of the crime and the circumstances of the crime itself. On the Crown’s version of events, all of the things necessary to constitute the crime were committed by EZ in the presence of the appellant and the appellant participated in those events beyond merely being present.
	
	
	It is in this context that the appellant’s somewhat elusive argument in support of ground 2 falls to be considered. It was submitted (tcpt 14/11/14, p 2 line 20 - p 6 line 16) that the trial judge had not directed the jury that it was necessary that the Crown prove that the understanding between the appellant and EZ was that each of the things necessary to constitute the crime charged would be committed by one or other of them including that the perpetrator either know that the sexual intercourse was without the complainant’s consent or be reckless as to whether she was consenting.
	
	
	The relevant extracts from the trial judge’s summing up are set out in the judgment of Simpson J at [116]. The appellant’s submission focused on the following part of that direction:
	


Now, clearly for the Crown to establish the guilt of [the appellant] in relation to this first count, the Crown would have to prove the requisite state of mind of [the appellant] namely the Crown would have to prove a shared intention with the other accused, [EZ], for [EZ] to have sexual intercourse with the complainant without her consent or regardless of her consent, that is realising that she may not be consenting, and that the events be committed in company.


	
	It was argued that the trial judge’s summing up, and in particular this direction, did not make clear that the understanding to which the appellant was a party had to be that the sexual intercourse take place without the complainant’s consent and that the jury also had to be satisfied that the appellant knew that the complainant was not consenting when the crime was committed by EZ.
	
	
	Earlier in his summing up, the trial judge stated that the elements of the offence included that the sexual intercourse be without the complainant’s consent and that the perpetrator know of that lack of consent. The trial judge also directed the jury as to the need for the Crown to establish beyond reasonable doubt both that the appellant was party to a continuing understanding with EZ that the acts constituting the crime would be committed by EZ and that it was committed in pursuance of that understanding. As had earlier been explained to the jury, the elements of that crime included EZ’s knowledge that the complainant was not consenting.
	
	
	The specific direction extracted above did not contradict or qualify what the trial judge had already said. It addressed the question of the “shared intention” of the appellant and EZ and did so in circumstances where the understanding or agreement referred to plainly concerned the crime of having sexual intercourse with the complainant without her consent. For that reason the appellant’s first submission as to the inadequacy of the summing up should be rejected.
	
	
	For the Crown to establish that EZ had sexual intercourse with the complainant without her consent, knowing that it was without her consent or reckless as to whether he had that consent, it was not necessary that it prove that the appellant also knew that the complainant was not consenting.
	
	
	However to establish that the appellant was guilty as a party to a joint criminal enterprise to commit that crime, it was necessary that the Crown prove that at the time of the commission of the principal act constituting the crime - sexual intercourse without consent - the appellant knew that the complainant was not consenting or was reckless as to the complainant’s consent. That was in addition to its proving that the appellant was party to a continuing understanding with EZ that they would have sexual intercourse with the complainant without her consent, either knowing that to be the position or being reckless as to the fact of consent. Proof of (i) the existence of that continuing understanding, (ii) the commission of that crime and the appellant’s participation in it and (iii) his knowledge of the absence of consent was necessary to make him criminally liable for EZ’s acts. The fact of that understanding and of the appellant’s presence and active participation were relied on by the Crown to establish that the appellant had the mens rea necessary to complete the commission of the crime: Osland at [93]; Likiardopoulos at [19].
	
	
	The trial judge directed the jury that for the Crown to establish the appellant’s guilty state of mind it had to prove that he shared an intention with EZ that the sexual intercourse be without the complainant’s consent or reckless as to whether she was consenting or not. The intention with which this direction is concerned is not merely a forward looking one that they would commit the acts constituting the crime. In terms it is described as an intention “shared” with EZ that there be sexual intercourse with the complainant without her consent or regardless of her consent. The trial judge earlier explained to the jury that in considering the question of EZ’s state of mind “you have to have regard to all of the circumstances, every circumstance under which the activity was committed.” (summing-up tcpt 15/05/13, p 10). In this way, the direction made sufficiently clear that the jury had to be satisfied that the appellant, like EZ, had either to have known at the time the intercourse occurred that the complainant was not consenting or to have been reckless as to that consent.
	
	
	Grounds 1 and 3 are that the verdicts in relation to counts 1 and 2 are unreasonable and cannot be supported by the evidence. Having made an independent assessment of the whole of the evidence, I agree with Simpson J that it was open to the jury to be satisfied of the appellant’s guilt on each of those charges beyond reasonable doubt. The matters relied upon by the appellant, and to which her Honour refers, do not justify the conclusion that the jury must reasonably have entertained a doubt about the appellant’s guilt: see Libke v The Queen [2007] HCA 30; 230 CLR 559 at [113].
	
	
	SIMPSON J: On 6 May 2013, in the District Court, the appellant and another male (to whom I will refer as EZ) were arraigned on an indictment that contained two counts alleging aggravated sexual intercourse without consent, brought pursuant to s 61J of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). The circumstance of aggravation alleged was that each offence was committed in company. Each accused entered a plea of not guilty to each count, and a trial by jury proceeded. The Crown case was that both offences were committed against the same victim, on 5 May 2012, and that the two accused were parties to a joint criminal enterprise.
	
	
	On 17 May the jury returned verdicts of guilty against each accused on each count. Pursuant to s 61J(1) of the Crimes Act, the offenders were rendered liable to a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 20 years. On 30 August Frearson DCJ sentenced both offenders. In respect of the appellant, on the first count, he imposed a fixed term of imprisonment of 23 months, commencing on 24 August 2013; on the second count, he imposed a term of imprisonment of 4 years, commencing on 24 November 2013 (and therefore accumulated by 3 months) with a non-parole period of 2 years which will expire on 23 November 2015. The total effective term of imprisonment is one of 4 years and 3 months, with a non-parole period of 2 years and 3 months. In so sentencing the appellant, Frearson DCJ found, pursuant to s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) special circumstances that justified departure from the proportion of the non-parole period to the head sentence that would have otherwise been required (that proportion being 75 per cent). His Honour gave as his reasons for the variation the appellant’s youth, and that the sentence would represent the appellant’s first period of incarceration. The overall non-parole period is 52 per cent of the overall head sentence.
	
	
	Frearson DCJ sentenced EZ, on the first count, to imprisonment for a fixed term of 14 months, commencing on 28 August 2013; on the second count to a term of imprisonment of 2 years and 2 months, commencing on 28 December 2013 (and therefore accumulated by 4 months) with a non-parole period of 13 months that expired on 27 January 2015. EZ’s effective sentence was of imprisonment for 2 years and 6 months, with a non-parole period of 17 months.
	
	
	The appellant now appeals against the convictions, and seeks leave to appeal against the sentences.
	
	
	The grounds of appeal against conviction involve the sufficiency of the evidence to support the convictions, and the directions given to the jury concerning the principles of joint criminal enterprise and circumstantial evidence. Having regard to the grounds advanced on the appellant’s behalf, it is necessary to set out, in some detail, the nature of the Crown case, and the responses made to that case.
	


The Crown case


	
	A brief outline of the Crown case follows. It will be necessary to examine more closely the evidence of the complainant, of various Crown witnesses, and of the appellant and of a witness called on his behalf.
	
	
	From about 7.15pm on 5 May 2012, the complainant, who was then 14 years of age, was with two friends of the same age at a park near Coogee Beach. There they consumed pizza, and tequila mixed with soft drink. The complainant became intoxicated. The three then joined another group of teenagers (older than they) at a nearby location on the beach. The appellant and EZ were among that group. The complainant stumbled and fell, and EZ assisted her to her feet and then steered her away from the group and up a hill. After a time, EZ was joined by the appellant. The complainant was sufficiently intoxicated as to need assistance in walking up the hill. The appellant gave that assistance. The complainant fell. The appellant pulled her up so that she was on her knees. EZ then, with the assistance of the appellant, forced his penis into the complainant’s mouth. This was the act that, the Crown alleged, constituted the sexual intercourse without consent the subject of the first count on the indictment. Although the appellant was not responsible for the act of intercourse, his presence and participation was, on the Crown case, sufficient to render him liable on the principles of joint criminal enterprise.
	
	
	Very soon after, another act of intercourse took place, this time penile/vaginal. Although in her evidence the complainant attributed this act to EZ, it was, on the Crown case, the appellant who penetrated the complainant. The Crown called DNA evidence to support that assertion. This was the act that gave rise to the second count on the indictment.
	
	
	Police were notified of the events in the park. A little before 10.00pm various police officers arrived at the scene. EZ and the appellant were arrested and taken to the Maroubra Police Station. Their clothing was taken for the purposes of DNA testing. A doctor (Dr Clifford) attended for the purpose of taking swabs, also for the purposes of DNA testing. I will refer to the results of DNA testing below.
	
	
	The complainant was taken to the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital. At about 4.00am Constable Danielle Roger took a statement from her. At about 9.00am the following day, 6 May, the complainant was examined by Dr Sumethri Rajendran. Dr Rajendran took a history from the complainant, and also took swabs from her mouth and vagina for the purposes of DNA testing. This DNA testing produced little of assistance. No semen was detected in the swabs from the complainant’s vagina.
	
	
	The complainant made a lengthy recorded interview with police on 9 May 2012, and another on 19 April 2013.
	


The trial

The Crown opening


	
	At the commencement of the trial the Crown prosecutor opened the case he proposed to present. He outlined the evidence he anticipated to be given concerning Count 1, the alleged act of oral intercourse by EZ. The transcript records that he said:
	


“As well as that the Crown challenged [sic - ? charged] [the appellant] re the sexual intercourse without consent. What we say is that [the appellant] was present at the time and present through an agreement, perhaps even moments before with [EZ] to commit sexual intercourse upon [the complainant] in circumstances where both men knew she was not consenting and it was obvious that she was not …”


	
	He proceeded to outline the Crown allegations with respect to Count 2, the penile/vaginal intercourse with the complainant, and is recorded as saying the following:
	


“She will then I anticipate tell you that she felt somebody, a person who we say was one of the accused, on top of her. Her description of who this person is, is of less detail than her description of the person who put his penis in her mouth, she is able to say that it was a slimmer person who put his penis in her mouth. Her description of who it was, was on top of her, is I anticipate based on the smell or a feeling of clothes or a feeling of weight … She says she felt, she would say that she felt someone holding her wrists, was heavy pressing down on her and her wrists were being held by hands …

Now, whatever he [sic - her] description is, those few descriptions of heaviness or clothing, the Crown’s first position is that this was [the appellant] who was on top of her and penetrating her vagina with his penis. At this point in time the Crown says that [EZ] remained nearby but exactly where, is unable to say …” (italics added)


	
	A little later, the Crown prosecutor said:
	


“Let me take you back then to count 2 on the indictment. I described to you what we say was an act of sexual intercourse. That is the penetration in [the complainant’s] vagina by the penis of the person we say primarily, or in our first position, is [the appellant]. Now this is quite clearly sexual intercourse, again the Crown needs to prove that it occurred without her consent and in the same way relying on what I’ve already explained to you, we need to prove that it was without consent and that [the appellant] knew that she was not consenting and we rely on the same things that we relied on … that he was reckless as to her not consenting.

And similarly we say that the two of them were in company in the same way that I have already explained to you and similarly we say that [EZ] is also responsible because of the joint criminal enterprise that had been entered into between them …” (italics added)


	
	A little later the Crown prosecutor is recorded as follows:
	


“Now we’re at a point in time where I’ve explained to you [the complainant’s] intoxication and I’ve indicated to you point in time where we’ve discussed the forensic examination and results of that examination particularly of the two accused. The Crown has put to you a case in which it says [EZ] had sexual intercourse with [the complainant] and did so by putting his penis in her mouth and that [the appellant] was present and is also guilty of that because of an agreement joint criminal enterprise and what the Crown then says is because of the forensic results, forensic results from the sampling of the penises of the two men if it be the case that [EZ] put his penis in [the complainant’s] mouth, [the appellant] has results that suggest he sexually penetrated [the complainant] as well and it must have been him who sexually penetrated her vagina and it is upon that basis that we say [the appellant] was the person, regardless of how [the complainant] might explain the person with heaviness of clothing of the smell regardless of what she says there we say it was [the appellant] who had sexual intercourse with [the complainant] because of the results particularly of the results from testing his penis and of [EZ].” (italics added)


	
	Towards the conclusion of his opening, he said:
	


“I want to finish this topic by saying this, if it in fact be the case that [the complainant] for reasons that perhaps have something to do with intoxication, lateness of the night or the lack of light, is confused about who put the penis in her mouth and it was in fact [the appellant], we say for the same reasons that I have been outlining to you, joint criminal enterprise, an agreement between the two to have sex with her in circumstances where she was not consenting then regardless of who did that act and regardless of who might have put their penis in her vagina, each is guilty of the first charge on the indictment and each is guilty of the second charge on the indictment. Again that is something perhaps that I need to say to you at the beginning of this trial to say look clearly what exist [sic], might be something that is further enlarged upon.” (italics added)

The defence opening


	
	Senior counsel who represented EZ made a brief opening. He said that the case for EZ acknowledged that he had had oral sex with the complainant, but that he believed that it was with her consent, and that he had every reason to believe that she was consenting.
	
	
	Counsel who represented the appellant also opened briefly. With respect to Count 1, he said that the appellant’s case was that he did not see any act of fellatio between EZ and the complainant, and that it would be put to the jury that they could not be satisfied that any such act was part of a joint criminal enterprise. With respect to Count 2, he said that the appellant’s case was that the penile/vaginal intercourse the subject of that count simply did not occur.
	


The evidence in the trial


	
	I turn now to an outline of the evidence so far as it is relevant to the various grounds of appeal pleaded. I preface that by noting that it was common ground in the trial that EZ was of a smaller, slighter build and stature than the appellant, and that the appellant was larger and bulkier. It was common for witnesses to differentiate between them using such terms. Where it is clear from the descriptions used by witnesses that the reference is to EZ or the appellant, I will use those terms rather than the clumsier descriptions.
	


The evidence in chief of the complainant


	
	The complainant’s evidence in chief was as follows.
	


In May 2012 she was 14 years of age. On the evening of 5 May she had arranged a “sleep over” at the home of a friend (to whom I will refer as “S”) who lived in Coogee. Another friend (to whom I will refer as “N”) was also to stay overnight. The complainant was wearing denim shorts, a shirt and a jumper, and flat heeled shoes. The three had a pizza delivered, which they took to eat on the beach. The complainant was carrying a bag in which she had placed a bottle of tequila, taken from her home. S bought a bottle of cola, which the girls mixed with the tequila. They sat on a pavement near the beach and ate the pizza and shared the tequila. After they had finished the pizza they walked up some stairs to a nearby park. The complainant felt as though she was “pretty drunk”.


	
	On at least one occasion the complainant fell over. A male came to help her. (It was common ground that this was EZ.) The complainant described him as “kind of slim, muscular, like athletic build”, with a Lebanese, or “western Sydney” accent. EZ helped the complainant to her feet, put one arm around her, and walked away with her at a “fast, really fast” pace. With the other arm he held her wrist.
	
	
	The complainant was quite affected by alcohol. EZ started to walk her up a hill. The complainant protested. She told him that she wanted to stay with her friends, and “kept screaming out” for her friends, calling them by name. EZ put his hand over her mouth. S began to walk along with them, asking EZ where he was taking the complainant, and telling him to leave her alone. EZ told S to go away. Another boy (not the appellant) approached and told S that she had dropped her bottle. EZ engaged the complainant in conversation, telling her she was pretty and that he liked her. She joined in the conversation, and told him that she liked him too. They walked up the hill, EZ supporting her.
	
	
	At this point, another man joined them. The complainant described him as “a big guy” and said that, because she could not really walk, “he was pretty much carrying me up the hill now”. It was accepted that this evidence related to the appellant.
	
	
	The following evidence is recorded in the transcript:
	


“Q.  Had you seen this heavier built guy earlier on in the park for example by the pavement?

A.  Yeah when I looked back when the first guy was taking me away, he was - the big guy was talking to my friend [N].

Q.  At this point in time where did you believe you were going?

A.  I had no idea, I kept asking. I was like where are we going and then the first guy [EZ] said ‘Your friends are not here’ because I kept asking about where they were and he said they’re up here, they’re up here and then they send the second guy [the appellant], he said ‘They’re down there with my friends’ and then I started getting really concerned and the second guy starting putting his hand, like just kept touching me like here across my shoulders and I just was getting worried and my friends - my friend - my phone was calling and they turned my phone off so I started walking back down the hill to go back down to my friends--”

The complainant was not sure, but thought it was “the second person” (that is, the appellant) who turned off her telephone.


	
	After they reached the top of the hill, she started walking down the hill, but she tripped over and fell to the ground. Both EZ and the appellant were still present. The complainant told EZ and the appellant that she wanted to remain on the ground. However “the big guy” (that is, the appellant) was grabbing her arm, attempting to pull her up and urging her to keep going. He pulled her to her knees. EZ was standing in front of her. The appellant was to one side, but:
	


“… eventually he had to stand behind me to keep me like - keep my head there, you know.”


	
	EZ pulled down his pants and exposed his penis, which he attempted to insert in the complainant’s mouth, eventually succeeding in doing so. The complainant said that she kept trying to pull her head away and telling him that she did not want to engage in the conduct. When he eventually did succeed in inserting his penis into her mouth, she bit it. He said:
	


“Come on just do it and watch your teeth.”

She pulled her head away again; EZ put his hand on the back of her head and pushed his penis into her mouth. This went on for about a minute.


	
	While this was happening the appellant was standing to one side. As she turned her head:
	


“… he was standing right behind me and was trying to like keep me there and keep me up.”

The complainant fell back to the ground. Up to this point she was still clothed. At some point, her clothes were removed. She was unable to say by whom, but she did not remove them herself.


	
	The transcript then records the following evidence:
	


“Q.  Now when you were on the ground did you notice somebody close to you?

A.  Yes.

Q.  What did you notice of that person when you were on the ground at this point in time?

A.  That they got on top of me.

Q.  Did you notice where their hands were?

A.  Yep. His hands were holding my wrists down because I was trying to push his just away from mine.

Q.  Where was his chest compared to your chest?

A.  The way he was positioned he was just trying to put his pressure on my hands, on my arms, so he was, his chest was probably a bit below mine.

Q.  And when this was happening did you feel something?

A.  Yes.

Q.  What did you feel?

A.  I just felt this really, really, strong pain.

Q.  Where did you feel the strong pain?

A.  Everywhere, I mean it was just like, like I knew what it was but it was just really, really painful and I can’t describe it but it was just so painful.

Q.  Was there any particular place where you felt it?

A.  Yeah I knew that it was his penis going inside of me but I don’t know I just felt it everywhere.

Q.  When you say going inside of you what do you mean?

A.  Like his penis going in my vagina.”


	
	The complainant was then asked what she remembered of the male who was doing this, to which she replied:
	


“I mean I know it was the first guy [EZ] because I remember I just, I just know you know, and I remembered his smell and his voice.”

She said the other male (that is, the appellant) was “just standing just a bit away from us”.


	
	In answer to a question from the trial judge, the complainant confirmed that the male who had penile/vaginal intercourse with her was “the boy that took me away”, that is, EZ.
	


Cross-examination of the complainant


	
	In cross-examination by senior counsel representing EZ, the complainant acknowledged that notes made by Constable Roger of the conversation with her at the hospital included the following:
	


“[victim] recalls male on top of her to feel heavy and that is why believes POI 2 [that is, the appellant].”


	
	It was put to the complainant that she had told the police officers at the hospital that she believed that the male who penetrated her vaginally was “the heavier male” (that is, the appellant) because of his weight. She replied:
	


“I wasn’t sure. I remember telling them that I wasn’t sure.”


	
	In cross-examination on behalf of the appellant, the complainant acknowledged that, in the first interview with police (9 May 2012), she had been asked what the “bigger guy” (that is, the appellant) was doing (during the first incident), to which she replied:
	


“He was just standing, like he was just standing there on the side. Maybe he kept on like turning his head like both ways.”

She acknowledged that she had not then made any mention of the appellant pulling her up (to her knees), saying that there was “a lot of information” in the first interview and that this was something that she had forgotten to mention.


	
	Later in the cross-examination on behalf of the appellant, she gave the following evidence:
	


“Q.  You talked about the act of sexual intercourse before the normal act of sexual intercourse, and it’s penile vaginal intercourse and you say the person who did that to you is the skinny guy [EZ], right?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Do you say that the other guy [the appellant] was there when this act of sex occurred?

A.  Yes.

Q.  But he wasn’t doing anything was he?

A.  Not that I remember.

Q.  So you do not remember him doing anything, is that correct?

A.  I don’t remember him having intercourse with me, no.

Q.  No, no, no, my question is that he was not doing anything?

A.  At that point in time.

Q.  I’m not asking you if he was performing some sort of sexual act, what I’m saying is that he was not doing anything, is that correct?

A.  I don’t understand what you’re asking me.

[His Honour intervened to ask if the questioning related to the time of the penile/vaginal intercourse]

Q.  Did you hear what his Honour says, I am talking about the time you were being subject to sexual intercourse in the normal way, the penis in your vagina. Do you say that at that point in time, the other person was not doing anything?

A.  Yes.”


	
	The cross-examiner went on to put to the complainant that no such act of intercourse had ever been performed upon her on that day, and that “for your own reasons you are making that up?”. She answered both questions by saying that the proposition contained therein was not true.
	


Other evidence in the Crown case


	
	Evidence was also given by the complainant’s two friends who had accompanied her to the park, and by two other young women who were also present but not part of the complainant’s group, or the appellant’s group.
	
	
	One witness to whom I will refer as “KL” was a 16 year old female present at the park with friends (one of whom was “LW”). They were sitting on the roof of a small building. KL saw two boys (who, it was not disputed, were EZ and the appellant). A female (the complainant) was lying on the ground. One of the males was standing on top of (over) the complainant, with a leg on either side of her body. This was the smaller of the two males (EZ). The larger (“chubbier”) man (the appellant) was standing nearby, looking towards where KL and her group were. The complainant attempted to get up; EZ pushed her back to the ground.
	
	
	KL was concerned about the welfare of the complainant, and approached the appellant, and asked if the complainant was “okay”. He replied that she was, and said “that’s his girlfriend”. KL asked if the complainant needed help, or needed to be taken to the security guards; the appellant said that she did not, but asked if KL had any water. KL then saw the three move on; the males each had an arm around the complainant, helping her up the hill.
	
	
	In cross-examination KL said that the appellant was about 5 metres away from the complainant and EZ.
	
	
	LW gave evidence similar to that of KL, and agreed that the appellant was about 5 metres away from the complainant and EZ.
	
	
	As mentioned above, the complainant was examined by Dr Rajendran at the hospital, beginning at 9.00am on 6 May 2012. The history taken by Dr Rajendran was given in her evidence in chief, and includes:
	


“[The complainant] remembered being separated from her friends and then being ‘pulled’ by a male, uphill. She recalled stumbling and falling over, then being pulled up by this male and ‘navigated further’. [The complainant] then noticed a second male. She was talking to both males who were supporting her from falling. She stumbled for a second time, fell, then couldn’t get up. The first male pulled her up and forced his penis into her mouth. His hands were on either side of her head as he was forcing his penis into her mouth. [The complainant] reported she kept trying to turn and pull away and the male would force her head back again. She recalled saying, ‘No, I am not ready’ …

[The complainant] fell to the ground then felt a person on top of her. She thinks it was the second male as he was heavy and was clothed differently. [The complainant] then felt pressure and pain in the vagina. Then she screamed …”


	
	Dr Rajendran conducted a physical examination of the complainant. She observed light bruising to the complainant’s knees. She found that the complainant did not have a very prominent hymen, and that it was unbroken. That did not necessarily exclude vaginal penetration, because the hymen is an “extensile” organ, capable of stretching and expanding to admit a penis or digit without injury. She did not see any semen in the complainant’s vagina.
	
	
	In cross-examination Dr Rajendran agreed that in most cases of vaginal penetration, some rupture to the hymen would be expected.
	
	
	Dr Rajendran then took samples of the complainant’s bodily fluids which were sent for DNA testing.
	


DNA evidence


	
	At some time after 9.00am on 6 May, at the Maroubra Police Station, Dr Clifford took swabs from the shaft and the head of the penises of both EZ and the appellant. “Tape lifts” were taken from the underwear that they were wearing when arrested. The swabs and the tape lifts were sent to Forensic Analysis and Science Services, where they were analysed by Ms Sandra Trabuio, a scientist employed at that laboratory.
	
	
	Also at some time after 9.00am on 6 May, Dr Rajendran took swabs from the mouth and vagina of the complainant. These were also sent to Forensic Analysis and Science Services for analysis by Ms Trabuio.
	
	
	Ms Trabuio gave the results of her analysis as follows. I note here that, in the case of each sample that yielded positive results, there was (as is usual) a major contributor and a minor contributor. In two of the results is this of any significance.
	
	
	The results were as follows:
	



	
	the swab from the shaft of EZ’s penis revealed DNA consistent with that of the complainant (this was the DNA of the minor contributor). DNA of that profile could be expected to occur in 1 in 310,000 individuals in the general population;
	
	
	swabs from the head of EZ’s penis also revealed DNA consistent with that of the complainant (again that of the minor contributor), and of a profile that could be expected to occur in 1 in 18,000 of the general population;
	
	
	tape lifts taken from the underpants of EZ revealed DNA consistent with that of the complainant (again that of the major contributor) and of a profile that could be expected to occur in 1 in 6.9 billion individuals in the general population;
	
	
	swabs from the shaft of the appellant’s penis revealed DNA consistent with that of the complainant (that of the minor contributor), the profile of which could be expected to occur in 1 in 100,000 of the general population;
	
	
	swabs taken from the head of the appellant’s penis revealed DNA consistent with that of the complainant (that of the minor contributor), the profile of which could be expected to occur in 1 in 1.9 million of the general population;
	
	
	tape lifts from taken from the underpants of the appellant revealed DNA consistent with that of the complainant (in this instance, the complainant’s DNA was again that of the major contributor), with a profile that could be expected to occur in 1 in 6.9 billion of the general population.
	


It was accepted that this evidence established that it was, in fact, the complainant’s DNA on the various sites.


	
	Examination by Dr Rajendran of the complainant’s vagina, and DNA testing of the swabs taken from her vagina detected no deposits of semen. Examination of swabs taken from her mouth revealed one sperm head, which was inadequate for the purposes of DNA identification.
	
	
	The one area in which the relative contribution was significant was in the results from the underpants of the appellant and EZ. There the DNA consistent with that of the complainant was the DNA of the major contributor. Ms Trabuoi gave an explanation for that. She said that if the DNA of the major contributor was not the DNA of the person who wore the underpants, that was an indication that the DNA probably came from “a rich source of DNA, something like saliva, vaginal secretions”. Ordinarily, she would expect that where the penis was rubbing on the underpants, large amounts of that DNA (that is, of the person wearing the underpants) would be present. She said:
	


“… if there’s DNA that’s deposited onto the penis, then a pair of underpants is put on while that DNA is still wet, you’d expect it to transfer onto the underpants. It generally tends to last longer on the underpants because it dries onto that area.”


	
	She said that the results from the shaft and head of the appellant’s penis, and from his underpants, were consistent with the appellant having put his penis inside the complainant’s vagina and then putting on his underpants. That was because if the penis were inside the vagina it would be expected that when removed it would be “quite moist”, and when the underpants were put back on, a transfer from the penis to the underpants would be effected. That could explain why the major contributor to the DNA in the appellant’s underpants was not the appellant, but could have been the complainant.
	
	
	With respect to the absence of semen in the complainant’s vagina, Ms Trabuio said that it was unlikely that skin cells from a person who had inserted his penis into a female vagina would be still present after six hours since that occurrence, and “very impossible” after 12 hours. It will be recalled that the complainant’s examination by Dr Rajendran commenced at some time after 9.00am. The evidence does not disclose with precision when the events the subject of the charges occurred, but police were called at about 9.45pm.
	
	
	In cross-examination on behalf of the appellant, Ms Trabuio agreed that DNA could be transmitted to a person’s hand by the mechanism of that person touching an item of clothing (particularly if the item of clothing was moist). It is best to set out the evidence as it is recorded in the transcript:
	


“Q.  … If it be the case that you picked up [the complainant’s] shorts could you put her DNA on your hand?

A.  You could.

Q.  … If it be the case that you picked up [the complainant’s] underpants I understand the answer you just gave in respect to the shorts it happen in respect to the underpants?

A.  To transfer to the person picking it up?

Q.  Transfer to the person's hands?

A.  It could. You would not expect a lot to be transferred that way.

Q.  What if it be the case when you were picking up the underpants you unwittingly actually touched the crutch of the underpants with the, how do you put it, feminine secretions in it?

A.  If you touch the crutch?

Q.  Crutch of the underpants with the feminine secretions in it?

A.  Yes.

Q.  That would be a good surface to pick up DNA?

A.  If you directly touched that area, yes.

…

Q.  If you did a DNA analysis of the crutch of the lady’s underpants it is likely that the DNA you would get from the feminine secretions would be a major component?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Because of the nature of feminine secretions?

A.  Vaginal secretions are very rich in DNA.

Q.  Very, very rich in DNA?

A.  Yes.

…

Q.  If it be the case you picked up the underpants, you touched this very good area for DNA and it is on your hand and then you went and urinated, as you have already talked about, and you took your penis out of your pants in that process could you put the DNA on your penis if you have touched the area?

A.  More than likely if you touched the area and it is still moist --

[At this point the cross-examiner interrupted and was directed to allow Ms Trabuio to answer.]

HIS HONOUR

Q.  More than likely if you touch the area and it is still moist?

A.  If it is still moist you would expect more to be transferred to the hand and if that hand is then with the moist secretion still on the hand almost immediately touched the other area then you could transfer it.

[COUNSEL FOR THE APPELLANT] Q.  Let's say if you went for a wee a couple of minutes later could you transfer it?

A.  You could.

Q.  It is not pie in the sky is it?

A.  No as long as you touch that area and more likely if the area was moist.

…

Q.  A person touches a person’s underpants in such circumstances may have touched or let’s say a person touches a person's underpants and did, albeit unwittingly, touches the crutch area of the underpants and then some minutes later touched the penis it is possible you would have transfer of DNA from A to B to C isn't it?

A.  You can.”

The defence cases


	
	The responses made by or on behalf of the appellant and EZ were markedly different.
	


The appellant


	
	The appellant gave evidence. His evidence was to the following effect.
	
	
	The appellant first saw the complainant when “my mate [EZ] was picking her up”. She hugged EZ. He hugged her. They then walked off in a northerly direction. The appellant joined the complainant’s friends. He and a friend of the complainant (N) followed EZ and the complainant, until they disappeared from view. N asked the appellant to go and get the complainant. He told N to sit next to a nearby hut, while he walked in a northerly direction to find EZ and the complainant. He saw them a distance up the hill and jogged and walked towards them. He lost sight of them for 3 to 5 (or a little over) minutes. He did not see them again until he reached the top of the hill. He started to walk towards them, and was approached by another woman, who asked about the welfare of the complainant (this was KL). The appellant replied that she was all right, she was EZ’s friend, and EZ was taking care of her. He began walking towards EZ and the complainant, and saw them walking off. He shouted to them, but they did not reply. He continued to call after them, and eventually caught up with them at the top of the hill. He shook EZ’s hand, and said hello to the complainant. She was very friendly. She asked if she could hold his hand and did so. She started to talk about N. She seemed excited and was very talkative. He suggested that they return to the group, and she said that she did not want to because it was boring. He suggested that she telephone her friends, and she produced her mobile phone. She was unable to remember her passcode. She then dropped the phone. They looked for it but the complainant said not to worry about it.
	
	
	The complainant was being flirtatious with EZ, holding him, whispering to him, and, the appellant thought, kissing him.
	
	
	EZ and the complainant walked on. The appellant remained where he was, and called another friend. He saw EZ and the complainant walk away. The appellant telephoned two other friends. He again lost sight of EZ and the complainant. EZ returned, alone, and joined the appellant. One of the friends to whom he had spoken called the appellant. He said that they were trying to find the complainant, and to return to the group. He walked further, and saw the complainant. She was naked from the waist down. He asked her what she was doing. She did not reply. Her clothes and bag were nearby. He picked up her shorts and pants. One of the items (he did not know which) was wet. He told her to put them on. She did not take them. She began to sway, and leaned towards him, and put all of her weight on him. He dropped the clothes and held her, so that she would not fall down. She was near some rocks. He found a suitable location on a flat rock and laid her down. He retrieved her shorts and handed them to her and asked her to put her shorts on, but she did not. He put the shorts down next to her. He could not recall if he also picked up her underwear. At this point she appeared intoxicated. He told her not to move, that he was going to get her friends. EZ was still present. The appellant told EZ that they had to get the complainant’s friends. He told EZ to wait because he (the appellant) was going to urinate. In his evidence in chief, he did not say that he had in fact urinated. Shortly after that, the police came and arrested him.
	
	
	In cross-examination the appellant expressly denied having seen EZ undo his jeans, expose his penis, insert his penis into the complainant’s mouth, or having seen the complainant move her head away. He denied holding her head in front of EZ, or seeing the complainant fall to the ground. He also expressly denied lying on top of the complainant or putting his penis in her vagina, or having intercourse with her. He said that he had a very vague recollection of urinating after he had left the scene.
	
	
	The appellant also called expert evidence with respect to DNA, from Professor Boettcher.
	
	
	Professor Boettcher, who was accepted as an expert in the field, gave evidence concerning the transfer of DNA. He said, for example, that DNA cells can be transferred from one person to another by handshaking. It is best to reproduce his subsequent evidence as it appears in the transcript:
	


“Q.  I want to put another scenario to you. I want to put to you this scenario; a person touches the shorts and the underpants of the female person, if that was to happen would that person be likely to get the female’s DNA on his hand?

A. Yes.

Q.  If the person in touching the female’s underpants inadvertently touched the crutch area of the underpants would that increase the chances of there being the female’s DNA on his hand?

A. Yes.

Q.  Why would it increase the chances?

A. Because in the crutch area of a female’s underpants, there will be vaginal mucous that lubricates the vagina and inside the vagina there are very soft cells that rub off very readily and that would be there on the crutch area of the underpants.

Q.  Now, if under such circumstances, I was to then touch my penis for whatever reason, such as urination or whatever, what are the prospects that I would transfer the female DNA from A to B to C? When I say ‘from A to B to C’, from the underpants to my hands to my penis; what are the chances?

A.  If the mucousy material in the underpants was, if you like, dampened, then I guess - and not dry - then there would be a very high likelihood of picking up the mucous that contained numerous cells shed from the female reproductive tract, and mucous being sticky is likely to be transferred elsewhere. And if the next thing that was touched was your penis, there is - under such a scenario, it would be likely that there would then be mucous with the cells on the penis.

Q.  When you say ‘likely’, are you saying more likely than not; like 51/49%, just tipping the balance or?

A.  No, I would say very likely, far higher than 50%. Much more likely than ‘not likely’ under the scenario I described.

Q.  I know it is hard to give us a precise figure, but can you give us like a range, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90% or whatever?

A.  I would give it in the higher range up, 80% or more.

…

HIS HONOUR

Q.  Would it depend, professor, on when you touched the penis, how long after you touched the mucous or that wouldn't matter or it would matter?

A.  It depends on the amount of moisture, your Honour, in that mucous is extremely sticky and it will stick to your hand and dry there, but then become moist again if it touches a damp area.”


	
	Professor Boettcher was asked to assume penile/vaginal intercourse with no ejaculation and no condom use, and was asked what were the chances of the male DNA being left in the vagina. He said that he considered it would be certain that there would be some cells left there, and would be detectable. However, when asked how long that DNA would be detectable, he was unable to answer. It depended, in part, from where in the vagina the swab was taken. He agreed that urination might wash away the cells from the lower vagina, but that would not occur in respect of the upper vagina.
	
	
	In cross-examination Professor Boettcher was asked about his examination of the DNA results provided by Ms Trabuio. What emerged from that cross-examination was that, it appeared from Ms Trabuio’s report, once the complainant’s physical examination revealed no semen, no further testing was undertaken for DNA from a male source other than semen.
	


EZ


	
	EZ did not give or call evidence. He relied on cross-examination of the Crown witnesses. Senior counsel who represented him opened and closed to the jury on the basis that he had engaged in oral intercourse with the complainant, but that he believed that the intercourse was consensual.
	


The issues in the trial


	
	The issues for the jury therefore were:
	


In respect of Count 1:

EZ:


	
	was the admitted act of oral intercourse with the complainant non-consensual?;
	


Appellant:


	
	was there an understanding or arrangement between EZ and the appellant that they (or one of them) would have non-consensual sexual intercourse with the complainant?
	
	
	if so, was there an act of non-consensual sexual intercourse between EZ and the complainant (on the evidence, an act of forced fellatio)?;
	
	
	if so, did the appellant participate in that act?
	


In respect of Count 2:

Appellant:


	
	did the appellant engage in penile/vaginal intercourse with the complainant?
	


(The issues relating to Count 2 so far as EZ is concerned are not relevant to the appeal.)

It was also necessary that the Crown prove that if there had been such an act, that it was non-consensual, and that the appellant knew that the complainant was not consenting, but these were not issues in the trial. It was inevitable, if the jury accepted the Crown case as to the act of intercourse, that it would also find it to have been non-consensual, and non-consensual to the knowledge of the appellant.


	
	In relation to Count 2, the appellant was charged as the principal perpetrator. This meant that, so far as he was concerned, the doctrine of joint criminal enterprise was immaterial. (It was relevant to the liability of EZ in respect of that offence, but that is not in issue in this appeal.) The doctrine was immaterial so far as the appellant was concerned because of the manner in which the Crown went to the jury. There were hints in the opening address of the Crown (see the extracts in [33] to [36] above) that it might have sought to retain an alternative position, that EZ was the actual perpetrator of that offence, and the appellant was present as a secondary party. That was never developed.
	
	
	The Crown position was made quite clear in his final address. He said:
	


“… and we also know in [the appellant’s] case as a result we have what we say is a substantial amount of her DNA on the inside of his underpants in circumstances where the conclusion can be readily drawn that we say his penis was in her vagina, the secretion from skin cells inside of the vagina are on his penis and therefore left on the inside of his underpants as the tape lift indicates.

It is that evidence we say, together with what [the complainant] says, and what is know [sic] as to how she was clothed, to say indeed her vagina was penetrated by a penis and it was the penis of [the appellant] …

…

It is a combination of those things that amounts to the Crown evidence in the case. It is a conclusion but we say again the only reasonable conclusion that can be drawn from this evidence is [the appellant] put his penis in [the complainant’s] vagina …”


	
	This position, adopted by the Crown, left no room for the alternative hypothesis, that EZ was the offender who vaginally penetrated the complainant, and that the appellant was liable by reason of his participation in a joint criminal enterprise. The vague hint given at the end of the Crown opening, extracted above, that the Crown might seek to put such an alternative position, was not pursued. On appeal, the Crown did not contend that the appellant could have been convicted if the jury were in doubt that he was the perpetrator of the act, but was present pursuant to a joint criminal enterprise. The conviction must stand or fall on that basis.
	


The grounds of appeal


	
	The grounds of appeal were formulated as follows:
	


“1.  That the verdict in relation to Count 1 is unreasonable, and/or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence.

2.  That the Learned Trial Judge failed to properly direct the jury as to a ‘joint criminal enterprise’ in relation to Count 1.

3.  That the verdict in relation to Count 2 is unreasonable, and/or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence.

4.  That the Learned Trial Judge failed to properly direct the jury as to ‘circumstantial evidence’ in relation to Count 2.

5.  The sentence is manifestly excessive in that the appellant has a justifiable sense of grievance when his penalty is compared to the co-offender.”


	
	It is convenient to deal first with Ground 2.
	


Ground 2: joint criminal enterprise


	
	The principles relating to joint criminal enterprise were stated by Hunt CJ at CL (McInerney and Sully JJ agreeing) in R v Tangye (1997) 92 A Crim R 545 at 556-557, in a passage which has received endorsement on many occasions, including in Osland v The Queen [1998] HCA 75; 197 CLR 316 at [73] per McHugh J; R v Tyrone Chishimba, Tyrone Chishimba v R; Likumbo Makasa v R, R v Likumbo Makasa [2010] NSWCCA 228 and Huynh v The Queen [2013] HCA 6; 295 ALR 624. The principles are stated as follows:
	


“(1)  The law is that, where two or more persons carry out a joint criminal enterprise, each is responsible for the acts of the other or others in carrying out that enterprise. The Crown must establish both the existence of that joint criminal enterprise and the participation in it by the accused.

(2)  A joint criminal enterprise exists where two or more persons reach an understanding or arrangement amounting to an agreement between them that they will commit a crime. The understanding or arrangement need not be express, and its existence may be inferred from all the circumstances. It need not have been reached at any time before the crime is committed. The circumstances in which two or more persons are participating together in the commission of a particular crime may themselves establish an unspoken understanding or arrangement amounting to an agreement formed between them then and there to commit that crime.

(3)  A person participates in that joint criminal enterprise either by committing the agreed crime itself or simply by being present at the time when the crime is committed, and (with knowledge that the crime is to be or is being committed) by intentionally assisting or encouraging another participant in the joint criminal enterprise to commit that crime. The presence of that person at the time when the crime is committed and a readiness to give aid if required is sufficient to amount to an encouragement to the other participant in the joint criminal enterprise to commit the crime.

(4)  If the agreed crime is committed by one or other of the participants in that joint criminal enterprise, all of the participants in that enterprise are equally guilty of the crime regardless of the part played by each in its commission.”


	
	The essentials are, therefore:
	



	
	an understanding or arrangement between two or more persons that they will commit a crime. (The acts constituting the crime may be committed by either or both.);
	
	
	the commission of the crime by one or other of the parties to the agreement or understanding;
	
	
	participation by the other party to the agreement or understanding. (Participation may be effected by mere presence at the time when the crime is committed.)
	



	
	Applying those principles to the present case, the following observations may be made. The crime the subject of Count 1 was sexual intercourse without consent, with knowledge that the complainant was not consenting. The act constituting the crime was forcing the complainant to perform fellatio on EZ.
	
	
	Notwithstanding the age of the complainant (which would have rendered the act criminal in any event, and which was relied on by the Crown as a statutory alternative to the count on the indictment), as the case was presented by the Crown, an essential element of the crime was the actual absence of consent to the intercourse (to the knowledge of both EZ and the appellant) by the complainant. Proof that an act of intercourse is non-consensual and that an accused person knows that the act is non-consensual is not the same as proof that two accused persons agree to participate in a non-consensual act of intercourse. The agreement and the actuality are not coextensive.
	
	
	On the Crown case, the participation by the appellant was constituted not merely by his presence, but by his actively holding the complainant while EZ inserted his penis into her mouth.
	


The directions


	
	The relevant directions given to the jury were recorded as follows:
	


“The Crown relies on something called joint criminal enterprise. It is not so complicated when you think about it. The law is that where two or more persons participate in a joint criminal enterprise, namely an agreement to carry out a particular criminal activity, each party is responsible for the acts of the others in carrying out the criminal enterprise. The Crown must establish beyond reasonable doubt, the existence of the joint criminal enterprise, and that the accused was a party to the joint criminal enterprise and that the crime was committed pursuant to the joint criminal enterprise.

A joint criminal enterprise exists where two or more persons reach an understanding or arrangement, amounting to an agreement, to commit a crime. The agreement need not be expressed and may be inferred from all the circumstances. It need not be reached at any particular time before the commission of the offence. The circumstances in which two or more persons participate in a crime may establish the existence of an understanding amounting to an agreement to commit the crime. It does not matter if one of the participants does all the things necessary to make up the crime, or whether they all played an active part or one did and the other one did not, all participants are guilty regardless of the part played.

Now, the Crown must establish that the offence was committed by one of them, and that the other accused – [the appellant] - was a party to a joint criminal enterprise to commit the offence, and that the offence that was committed was committed pursuant to that joint criminal enterprise.

Now, clearly for the Crown to establish the guilt of [the appellant] in relation to this first count, the Crown would have to prove the requisite state of mind of [the appellant] namely the Crown would have to prove a shared intention with the other accused, [EZ], for [EZ] to have sexual intercourse with the complainant without her consent or regardless of her consent, that is realising that she may not be consenting, and that the events be committed in company.

…

Now, when I say ‘intention to commit the crime’ I have mentioned to you that on this question of joint criminal enterprise you need to be satisfied that the crime was committed; you may be satisfied that the crime was committed by going back to the elements of the offence I gave you in relation to [EZ] for count 1. You have to be satisfied that [the appellant] was part of the joint criminal enterprise to commit that crime, and the crime was committed pursuant to the joint criminal enterprise.’

These directions were not the subject of complainant by the appellant’s counsel.

the appeal


	
	Two separate written submissions were filed on behalf of the appellant in respect of Ground 2. In the first, the specific complaint made was relatively simple. It was that an essential element of proof of an offence on the basis of joint criminal enterprise is proof of participation. So much can be accepted. The complaint was that the trial judge failed to explain to the jury what was meant by “participation”. This omission meant, it was submitted, that the directions “failed to capture a crucial part of what it means to participate in a joint criminal enterprise”.
	
	
	The submissions, while complaining of the absence of any direction as to the meaning of “participation”, did not identify the content of the direction it was contended ought to have been given.
	
	
	In the second written submission (prepared by different, senior, counsel), a different approach was taken. On these submissions, the complaint was that the directions failed to make clear that, for the appellant to be guilty as a participant in a joint criminal enterprise (specifically, to commit the crime of having sexual intercourse without consent, knowing the complainant was not consenting), it was necessary that the jury be directed that the Crown had to prove (to the requisite standard) that the appellant knew that the complainant was not consenting to the sexual intercourse. The directions, it was contended, failed to do this. That was because the directions concerning the appellant’s knowledge of lack of consent were incorporated in the directions concerning intention, and did not separately address the question of the appellant’s knowledge as what might be called a secondary participant. In other words, as I understand the argument (as it is developed in the second written submission) the direction conflated the question of the intention to have intercourse without consent (as to which recklessness would be sufficient) with the appellant’s knowledge of the fact of the complainant’s lack of consent (as to which, it was submitted, recklessness would not be sufficient).
	
	
	In support of this submission reliance was placed upon a short passage in Giorgianni v The Queen [1985] HCA 29; 156 CLR 473 at pp 504-505. That case concerned an allegation of aiding and abetting the commission of an offence, a different way of establishing liability. However, in the joint judgment of Wilson, Deane and Dawson JJ, the following relevant passage appears:
	


“Intent is an ingredient of the offence of aiding and abetting or counselling and procuring and knowledge of the essential facts of the principal offence is necessary before there can be intent. It is actual knowledge which is required and the law does not presume knowledge or impute it to an accused person where possession of knowledge is necessary for the formation of a criminal intent …”

Resolution of Ground 2


	
	This complaint as to the directions on participation ought to be rejected. Participation may be proved, where the relevant arrangement or agreement is proved, by evidence of an accused’s mere presence at the scene of the crime: Tangye, in the principle numbered (3). The complainant’s evidence, if accepted, was ample to prove participation to that extent. However, the evidence went further than that, and asserted much more actual participation by the appellant.
	
	
	No disputed issue arose in the trial as to participation by the appellant. His case (which the jury clearly rejected) was that he was not present when EZ had sexual intercourse with the complainant, and therefore did not participate, either by his presence or otherwise.
	
	
	The complaint has echoes of the complaint made in Huynh (on appeal from the Full Court of the Supreme Court of South Australia): see [7]. Of that, the High Court said:
	


“7  … The significance of that omission is the first issue raised by the appeals. Its resolution requires consideration of the real issues in the trial and of the sufficiency of the directions to guide the jury to their decision on those issues. That consideration requires analysis of the separate case of each appellant …

31  The contention that it is an error of law for a trial judge to omit to instruct a jury on all of the elements of liability for an offence cannot stand with the many decisions of this Court affirming the statement of the responsibility of the trial judge in Alford v Magee [[1952] HCA 3; 85 CLR 437]. The duty is to decide what the real issues in the case are and to direct the jury on only so much of the law as they need to know to guide them to a decision on those issues …

32  Whether the omission to specify the requirement of proof of participation in the directions on joint enterprise liability was an error depends upon whether the Full Court was right to conclude that proof of that fact was not an issue at the trial …

…

35  The Full Court identified the real issue in each case as whether the jury were satisfied that the prosecution had proved the agreement specified in par (1) of the direction … Proof of such an agreement relied on drawing an inference from the appellant’s conduct. If the conduct proved the agreement, it necessarily proved the appellant’s participation in that agreement …” (internal citations omitted)

See also Dhanhoa v The Queen [2003] HCA 40; 217 CLR 1 at [20].


	
	Similarly, in the present case, proof of both agreement and participation depended upon the jury drawing an inference from the conduct of the appellant, as alleged by the Crown. Proof of the conduct was sufficient to prove participation. That depended upon the jury’s acceptance of the complainant’s account. If the jury accepted that account, it was entitled to draw the twin inferences as to the agreement and participation. It clearly did accept the complainant’s account, and drew the inferences.
	
	
	That brings me to an additional reason why this complaint ought to be rejected. The direct evidence in respect of the appellant’s participation in this offence is that of the complainant, and that of the appellant. On the appellant’s case, he was not present and knew nothing of EZ’s act of sexual intercourse with the complainant. On the Crown case, the appellant was not only present (which would be sufficient) but actively assisted by deflecting the attention of KL, (possibly) turning off the complainant’s mobile phone, attempting to pull her up from the ground after she fell, urging her to keep going, and holding her head so that EZ could commit the act. Had the trial judge directed the jury more explicitly on the meaning of participation, it would also have been necessary to refer the jury to the evidence of the conduct alleged against the appellant that constituted participation. Drawing attention to these matters could hardly have assisted him.
	
	
	The complaint as to the absence of direction on the appellant’s knowledge of lack of consent ought also to be rejected. The reference to “shared intention” in the extracted passage from the summing up makes it quite clear that the words that follow apply to both accused.
	
	
	Again, the state of the complainant’s mind was not an issue as between the Crown and the appellant. It was not the appellant’s case that he was aware that EZ was having sexual intercourse with the complainant, but believed that she was consenting. The appellant’s case was that he was unaware of the sexual intercourse between EZ and the complainant. I repeat, the task of the trial judge is to direct the jury in respect of the issues as they are fought in the trial.
	
	
	Further, as is the case with respect to the previous complaint, a direction in the terms for which the appellant now contends could not have helped him. It would, again, have been necessary for the trial judge to direct the jury with respect to the specific evidence of the complainant relevant to this issue. It will be recalled that her evidence was that the appellant was present while she was telling EZ that she did not want to engage in sexual activity, and was holding her up as she kept turning her head.
	
	
	In my opinion, on a fair reading of the directions given, it was perfectly plain that it was an essential part of the Crown case to prove that the complainant was, in fact, not consenting. Any additional direction would have been adverse to the interests of the appellant.
	
	
	I would reject Ground 2.
	


Ground 4: circumstantial evidence


	
	The preliminary contention on behalf of the appellant under this ground of appeal was that “in truth” the case against the appellant in respect of Count 2 was circumstantial. That is not entirely correct. There was evidence from Dr Rajendran, to which there was no objection, that the complainant had given to her a description of the perpetrator consistent with the appellant and not with EZ. Dr Rajendran noted that the complainant said that she thought it was “the second male” who committed the second offence. She thought this because “he was heavy and was clothed differently”. That was direct evidence: Evidence Act 1995 (NSW), s 66(2).
	
	
	The direction given in this respect by the trial judge is recorded in the transcript as:
	


“In a sense the case against [the appellant] in relation to count 2 is circumstantial and it comes about this way because the complainant says there were two acts. It seems to be common ground that the first act of fellatio is performed by [EZ]. The Crown points to other circumstances, in particular the DNA evidence. The Crown says the only reasonable explanation is that the other act was performed by [the appellant]. The complainant cannot say who it was really.

So the case is put on the basis of circumstantial evidence. Part of your function is to draw conclusions extends [sic] to drawing reasonable inferences or conclusions from facts you find established. Circumstantial evidence is no better or worse than direct evidence. Direct evidence is when you have the direct observation of what a witness saw or heard. Circumstantial evidence is no better or worse, you just need to consider each case on its own facts and circumstances, on its own merits. But what you need to be aware of is this. Where the Crown asks you to draw an inference from the circumstance or circumstantial evidence, namely that it was [the appellant] who had the penile/vaginal intercourse, if I can use that expression, that must be the only reasonable explanation of the evidence and that is because the identity of the perpetrator, has to be proved beyond reasonable doubt.”


	
	Although, in the first set of written submissions filed on behalf of the appellant, specific arguments were directed to this ground, on the hearing of the appeal, senior counsel elected to address Ground 4 in conjunction with Ground 3 (that the verdict in respect of Count 2 is unreasonable).
	
	
	The submission was:
	


“4.3  The jury should have been told in light of the appellant’s case, that if his version of the DNA on his penis and underwear were a reasonable ‘possibility’, then the jury were bound to acquit him on Count 2.”

“[The appellant’s] version” of how the complainant’s DNA found its way onto his penis is the scientific evidence that it could, as a result of his picking up the complainant’s clothing, have been transferred to his hand, then to his penis (both shaft and head) in the course of urinating.


	
	It was proposed that the following direction ought to have been given:
	


“If, having considered the evidence of the accused as to how the complainants [sic] DNA got on his penis, you accept it, then of course you must acquit the accused and bring in a verdict of ‘not guilty’, because it would follow that the Crown has not established beyond reasonable doubt its case in relation to an essential matter which it must prove.

If, after having given consideration to the evidence of the accused and any evidence which the Crown asks you to take into consideration, you do not positively accept the evidence of the accused, but that evidence leaves you nevertheless with a reasonable doubt as to whether the Crown has made out its case in respect of any essential matter which it must prove, then you are bound, in law, to bring in a verdict of ‘not guilty’. In other words, it is not the position that you have to believe that the accused is telling the truth before the accused is entitled to be acquitted. As I have previously emphasized to you throughout the whole of this case, it remains the position that the Crown must establish beyond reasonable doubt the charge which it brings against the accused, and it is never for the accused to prove that he or she is not guilty.”

Both paragraphs are correct. The second is merely a different way of expressing what the jury was told.


	
	What was proposed in para 4.3 of the submissions was that, on the principles stated in Shepherd v The Queen [1990] HCA 56; 170 CLR 573, there was an “indispensable intermediate fact” upon which the Crown case depended, and which, therefore, it was necessary that the Crown prove beyond reasonable doubt. That that was the import of the submission was recognised by senior counsel in his oral argument. The “indispensable intermediate fact” was not specifically identified in the written submissions. However, in oral argument senior counsel identified it as “that DNA as a result of penile/vaginal intercourse was found on the appellant’s penis” (italics added). (It is the words “as a result of penile/vaginal intercourse” that are the key to this submission. There was no dispute that the complainant’s DNA was located on the appellant’s penis.) Senior counsel argued that, if there was some (reasonable) possibility that the complainant’s DNA had found its way onto the appellant’s penis by some means other than penile/vaginal intercourse, (such as the transfer mechanism) then the appellant was entitled to acquittal. Senior counsel put that in conjunction with the proposition, as recorded in the transcript “… if there was any [reasonable] possibility that the complainant was [sic - ? not] accurate in the evidence that she gave before the jury”, the appellant was also entitled to acquittal.
	


Resolution of Ground 4


	
	Given that the complainant’s unequivocal evidence in chief was that the perpetrator of the second act of intercourse was EZ, and that the Crown sought to displace that certainty by (inter alia) the DNA evidence, the manner in which the complainant’s DNA came to be deposited on the appellant’s penis - and in his underpants - was of considerable significance. The only other item of evidence that inculpated the appellant as the perpetrator of this act was that of Dr Rajendran, who recorded the complainant in her history (taken within hours of the events) as having described the perpetrator of this act in terms that clearly identified the appellant.
	
	
	Shepherd is authority for the proposition that:
	


“…if it is necessary for the jury to reach a conclusion of fact as an indispensable, intermediate step in the reasoning process towards an inference of guilt, that conclusion must be established beyond reasonable doubt.”

A “conclusion of fact as an indispensable intermediate step” is a fact without proof of which the Crown case would fail.


	
	Dawson J, with whom Mason CJ, Toohey and Gaudron JJ agreed, said:
	


“… it may sometimes be necessary or desirable to identify those intermediate facts which constitute indispensable links in a chain of reasoning towards an inference of guilt. Not every possible intermediate conclusion of fact will be of that character. If it is appropriate to identify an intermediate fact as indispensable it may well be appropriate to tell the jury that that fact must be found beyond reasonable doubt before the ultimate inference can be drawn. But where - to use the metaphor referred to by Wigmore on Evidence … - the evidence consists of strands in a cable rather than links in a chain, it will not be appropriate to give such a warning. It should not be given in any event where it would be unnecessary or confusing to do so. It will generally be sufficient to tell the jury that the guilt of the accused must be established beyond reasonable doubt and, where it is helpful to do so, to tell them that they must entertain such a doubt where any other inference consistent with innocence is reasonably open on the evidence.” (italics added)


	
	In the circumstances of this case, it was, to a very significant extent, the DNA evidence that was relied upon to prove that the appellant was the person who had penile/vaginal intercourse with the complainant; that proposition was in direct contradiction of the oral evidence given by the complainant. But that does not compel the conclusion that a Shepherd direction was called for.
	
	
	The submission quietly ignores the much more potent evidence concerning the complainant’s DNA in the appellant’s underpants (where she was the major contributor).
	
	
	The inferences available to be drawn from the evidence in the trial were the subject of the usual directions, specifically in respect of circumstantial evidence, as set out above.
	
	
	In the words of Dawson J, it would have been unnecessary and confusing to give a separate direction as is now contended ought to have been given.
	
	
	Further, as was the case with respect to the directions the subject of Ground 2, any additional direction would have required attention to be drawn to the relevant evidence. For reasons that will appear when I deal with Ground 3, that would not have benefitted the appellant.
	
	
	I would reject Ground 4 of the appeal.
	


Rule 4


	
	Rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules provides as follows:
	


“No direction, omission to direct, or decision as to the admission or rejection of evidence, given by the Judge presiding at the trial, shall, without the leave of the Court, be allowed as a ground for appeal or an application for leave to appeal unless objection was taken at the trial to the direction, omission, or decision by the party appealing or applying for leave to appeal.”


	
	The application of r 4 has been the occasion of much discussion in this Court. It must be seen in the light of s 5 and s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW). Section 5 and s 6(1) relevantly provide as follows:
	


“5(1)  A person convicted on indictment may appeal under this Act to the court:

(a)  against the person’s conviction on any ground which involves a question of law alone …”

“6(1)  The court on any appeal under section 5(1) against conviction shall allow the appeal if it is of opinion that the verdict of the jury should be set aside … on the ground of the wrong decision of any question of law …”


	
	In Papakosmas v The Queen [1999] HCA 37; 196 CLR 297 at [72], McHugh J pointed out that, where objection has not been taken to a ruling or direction (or omission to direct in the terms contended for on appeal) no “wrong decision of law” for the purposes of s 6(1) has been identified or made. The obligation on this Court to set aside a conviction is not engaged, unless, under r 4, the Court gives leave to argue the ground notwithstanding the absence of objection.
	
	
	The issues raised by Grounds 2 and 4, not having been raised at trial, require leave under r 4. When regard is had to the manner in which the trial was conducted, and the real issues in the trial, it is quite apparent, for the reasons that have been given at length, that there was no call for either of the directions the subject of Grounds 2 and 4.
	
	
	Accordingly, on that basis, I would refuse leave under r 4 to argue those grounds.
	


Grounds 1 and 3: unreasonable verdicts (Count 1 and Count 2)


	
	The authorities concerning the role of this Court in determining a ground that a verdict is unreasonable and cannot be supported by the evidence are legion: see, for example: Whitehorn v The Queen [1983] HCA 42; 152 CLR 657; Chamberlain v The Queen (No 2) [1984] HCA 7; 153 CLR 521; M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; 181 CLR 487; MFA v The Queen [2002] HCA 53; 213 CLR 606; SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; 243 CLR 400; Raumakita v R [2011] NSWCCA 126; 210 A Crim R 326.
	


“The Court is to make an independent assessment of the evidence, both as to its sufficiency and quality. This involves a question of fact. The Court is to determine whether the evidence is such that it was open to a jury to conclude beyond reasonable doubt that the Appellant was guilty. The central question is whether this court is satisfied that the Appellant is guilty of the offence charged …” (Raumakita at [31])


	
	I turn then to apply those statements of principle to the issues raised on behalf of the appellant in the present case.
	


Count 1


	
	In written submissions essentially two points were made in support of this ground. The first was that inconsistencies in the evidence of the complainant were such as to demonstrate that the verdict was unreasonable. Reference was made to the complainant’s evidence that, when she was on her knees, the appellant was “standing to the side and then eventually he had to stand behind me like - keep my head there, you know”. This was contrasted with what the complainant had said in her interview of 9 May. In cross-examination she acknowledged that, in that interview, she had not said that the appellant was pulling her up before or when EZ was forcing his penis into her mouth.
	
	
	The second point made concerned the evidence of KL and LW, placing the appellant five metres away from the complainant and EZ. The submission was that it could not be said that the appellant was “actively participating in a joint criminal enterprise to sexually assault”.
	


Count 2


	
	In support of the unreasonable verdict ground in relation to Count 2, four points were made on behalf of the appellant. They were:
	



	
	the complainant’s evidence that it was EZ who performed penile/vaginal intercourse upon her;
	
	
	the DNA evidence, indicating, at the least, a reasonable possibility that the complainant’s DNA on the appellant’s penis had been transferred by innocent means;
	
	
	the absence of any male DNA in the vagina of the complainant;
	
	
	that the complainant’s hymen was unruptured, suggesting at least the possibility that there had been no penile/vaginal intercourse.
	



	
	Counsel argued that the complainant’s evidence alone provided a sufficient basis for the success of this ground of appeal. He then turned to the DNA evidence, and submitted:
	


“The appellant acknowledges that this evidence supports the proposition that there was the transfer of DNA of the complainant to the penis of the appellant, and that this DNA evidence is consistent with the Crown case that it was the appellant who vaginally penetrated her with his penis.”

He then argued, however, that other evidence in the trial “strongly support[ed] another, equally plausible explanation for this DNA evidence”.


	
	That explanation arose from the appellant’s evidence that he had picked up the complainant’s shorts and underwear, that one of those items was wet, that he then dropped the clothes so that he could prevent the complainant from falling over, that he lay her flat on the rocks and again picked up her shorts and possibly her underwear. He said that he then told EZ to wait with the complainant because he (the appellant) was going to urinate. In cross-examination he said he some “very vague” recollection of urinating on the hill.
	
	
	Reference was made to the evidence of Ms Trabuio and Professor Boettcher, who agreed that DNA can be transferred from an item of clothing (particularly one that is moist) to the hand of a person who touches that item, and then from the hand to a body part (for example, a penis) if that body part is then touched with the hand.
	


Resolution of Grounds 1 and 3

Count 1


	
	There are no material inconsistencies in the complainant’s accounts. The fact that, in her 9 May interview, she did not expressly mention that the appellant was “pulling her up” is of little significance.
	
	
	The record of the interview of 9 May was not in evidence. However, cross-examination revealed that it was a lengthy interview - at least 265 questions, 26 pages. It was made four days after the events in question; events which must, (even if the intercourse with EZ had been consensual) have been the cause of some trauma.
	
	
	The major inconsistency, if it were found, in the complainant’s accounts was that relating to the identification of the perpetrator of the second act of sexual intercourse. Not surprisingly, no reliance was placed upon that inconsistency.
	
	
	As to the second point, concerning the evidence of KL and LW, it seems to me that this evidence has been misunderstood. Clearly, what KL and LW observed took place before the complainant, EZ and the appellant went up the hill, where the two instances of sexual intercourse were said to have taken place. The evidence of KL and LW throws no light on what there happened.
	
	
	In my opinion, it was amply open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the appellant’s guilt in relation to Count 1. For my part, having read the whole of the evidence, I am satisfied to the requisite standard that the appellant was present and participating in the offence committed by EZ, pursuant to an arrangement or agreement between them to commit such an offence.
	


Count 2


	
	In this context, the DNA evidence needs to be subjected to more stringent examination than it has in the appellant’s submission. It will be recalled that, in contrast to other deposits of DNA, the evidence showed that the complainant was the major contributor to the DNA located in the appellant’s underpants. Even bearing in mind the evidence of the manner in which DNA can be transferred from one surface to another, it must be unlikely to a high degree that merely picking up an item of clothing, even if that item of clothing had DNA of the complainant on it, could transfer to the hand of the appellant, then to his penis, and then to his underpants, sufficient of the complainant’s DNA to constitute the major contribution of the DNA on the underpants.
	
	
	The DNA evidence is a powerful item of evidence in the Crown case. The absence of male DNA from the complainant’s vagina is explained by the evidence of Professor Boettcher that, once no sperm was detected, no further relevant investigations were undertaken, and by the evidence of Dr Rajendran concerning the lifespan of DNA in the vagina. Finally, although Dr Rajendran accepted that, ordinarily, it would be expected that a hymen would be ruptured by penile/vaginal intercourse, the complainant’s physiology was such that her hymen was thin, not prominent, and it was possible for penetration to take place without rupture.
	
	
	Having considered all of the evidence, I am satisfied that it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was guilty of the offence the subject of Count 2. I am, for my own part, also satisfied of that fact.
	
	
	I would therefore reject this ground of appeal. It follows that the appeal against conviction must be dismissed.
	


Ground 5: the application for leave to appeal against sentence


	
	Notwithstanding the language in which this ground is framed, the sole issue raised was parity with the sentences imposed on the co-offender, EZ. In Lowe v The Queen [1984] HCA 46; 154 CLR 606, Mason J (as he then was) stated the “correct principle” to be applied in cases of discrepancy in sentencing as follows:
	


“It is that a Court of Appeal is entitled to intervene when there is a manifest discrepancy such as to engender a justifiable sense of grievance, by reducing a sentence, which is not excessive or inappropriate considered apart from the discrepancy, to the point where it might be regarded as inadequate.”


	
	The principle was further explained by the High Court in Postiglione v The Queen [1997] HCA 26; 189 CLR 295 by Dawson and Gaudron JJ, as follows:
	


“The parity principle upon which the argument in this Court was mainly based is an aspect of equal justice. Equal justice requires that like should be treated alike but that, if there are relevant differences, due allowance should be made for them … In the case of co-offenders, different sentences may reflect different degrees of culpability or their different circumstances. If so, the notion of equal justice is not violated. On some occasions, different sentences may indicate that one or other of them is infected with error … Ordinarily, correction of the error will result in there being a due proportion between the sentences and there will then be equal justice. However, the parity principle, as identified and expounded in Lowe … recognises that equal justice requires that, as between co-offenders, there should not be a marked disparity which gives rise to ‘a justifiable sense of grievance’ … If there is, the sentence in issue should be reduced, notwithstanding that it is otherwise appropriate and within the permissible range of sentencing options.

Discrepancy or disparity is not simply a question of the imposition of different sentences for the same offence. Rather, it is a question of due proportion between those sentences, that being a matter to be determined having regard to the different circumstances of the co-offenders in question and their different degrees of criminality.” (internal citations omitted)


	
	As mentioned above, the appellant was sentenced to a total term of imprisonment for 4 years and 3 months, with a non-parole period of 2 years and 3 months. EZ was sentenced to a total term of imprisonment of 2 years and 6 months, with a non-parole period of 1 year and 5 months. The difference in the head sentence is 21 months, in the non-parole period 10 months.
	
	
	In sentencing, Frearson DCJ, as he was obliged to do, had regard to s 6 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 (NSW), and the ages of the two offenders.
	
	
	It is quite apparent that the sentencing judge was conscious of the question of parity in sentencing. The sole reason for the disparity was the difference in the ages of the two offenders. EZ was 15 years and almost 2 months at the time of the offending. The appellant was 17 years and almost 8 months - close to legal adulthood, as his Honour observed. Frearson DCJ recognised that EZ had been the initiator of the offences, and that the applicant “joined in”.
	
	
	He rejected a Crown submission that, given his age, the appellant ought to serve his sentence in an adult prison: see Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act, s 19.
	
	
	The submission made on behalf of the appellant is that it was not open to the sentencing judge to differentiate as he did on the basis of age. There was, it was submitted, “no considerable age difference”; such difference as there was, was “not so marked as to justify a significant disparity in sentence”.
	
	
	In response, the Crown relied upon the decision of McClellan CJ at CL (with whom Hall and Price JJ agreed) in KT v R [2008] NSWCCA 51; 182 A Crim R 571, and particularly the following:
	


“26  The weight to be given to considerations relevant to a person’s youth diminishes the closer the offender approaches the age of maturity (R v Hoang [2003] NSWCCA 380 at [45]). A ‘child-offender’ of almost eighteen years of age cannot expect to be treated substantially differently from an offender who is just over eighteen years of age … However, the younger the offender, the greater the weight to be afforded to the element of youth …” (some internal citations omitted)

Resolution of Ground 5


	
	I would reject this ground. The age difference between the two offenders is considerable. It is true that EZ played the major role in the lead up to the commission of the offences, but once the offending behaviour was underway, the two were equal participants.
	
	
	While, in my opinion, it would have been open to the sentencing judge to have imposed on the appellant sentences more closely aligned with those imposed on EZ, the weight to be attributed to factors such as age was a matter for him: Bugmy v The Queen [2013] HCA 37; 249 CLR 571 at [24]. The disparity is not such as to warrant the intervention of this Court.
	
	
	I would grant leave to appeal against the sentences, but would dismiss the appeal.
	
	
	WILSON J: I have read in draft the comprehensive judgment of Simpson J. I agree with her Honour’s conclusions and the orders that she proposes.
	
	
	The factual circumstances and relevant law have been set out in detail by her Honour and there is no need for any further dissertation on those aspects of the matter. I wish only to add the following in relation to grounds 1 - 4.
	
	
	The arguments advanced in support of grounds 2 and 4 were not matters raised before the trial judge. There was no complaint made by trial counsel about the directions that his Honour gave, and no request for any further or other directions to be given. This suggests that trial counsel saw no need for any other directions in the context of the trial as it was conducted before the jury. Rule 4 applies.
	
	
	Whilst this Court will always be alert to correct injustice regardless of the application of the rule, such is not the case here. The directions given by the trial judge were appropriate in the circumstances of the case; those given to the jury concerning joint criminal enterprise were in accordance with well settled law: McAuliffe v The Queen [1995] HCA 37; 183 CLR 108 and Tangye v R (1997) 92 A Crim R 545.
	
	
	In common with Simpson J. I would reject these grounds.
	
	
	As to grounds 1 and 3 they are, in my view, entirely without merit.
	
	
	The nature of the task of an appellate court in determining a claim that a verdict is unreasonable has been set out in the judgment of Simpson J. The court must independently assess the sufficiency and quality of the whole of the evidence and determine whether the evidence is such that it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the applicant’s guilt.
	
	
	That task should be undertaken bearing in mind the advantage the jury had of seeing and assessing witnesses, an advantage not available to a court reviewing the evidence through the more opaque medium of a transcript. In a case such as this, where there were live issues of credit, not excluding the credibility of the appellant, the jury’s advantage was a significant one. Implicit in the jury’s verdict is an acceptance of the complainant’s evidence of essential matters to the requisite standard, and a rejection of the evidence given by the appellant.
	
	
	Having carefully reviewed the evidence before the Court, I consider the jury’s assessment of the evidence, and the verdicts that it returned, were well open to it.

	HOEBEN CJ at CL: 
	


Offence and sentence

On 9 December 2005 the applicant was found guilty by a jury of the murder of Lyndsay Van Blanken. The maximum penalty for murder is life imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of 20 years.


	
	On 28 April 2006 the applicant was sentenced by Mathews AJ to imprisonment with a non-parole period of 18 years, commencing 19 May 2004, with a balance of term of 9 years.
	
	
	The applicant seeks an extension of time for leave to appeal from sentence on the following grounds:
	


Ground 1 – Her Honour’s sentencing discretion miscarried by reason of her:


	
	(a)   Adopting a two stage approach to sentencing; and
	
	
	(b)   Giving determinative significance to the standard non-parole period contrary to the principles identified in Muldrock v R [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120.
	


Factual background


	
	The victim was born in August 1985 and was a little over 18 years old when she was murdered on 24 November 2003. She was described as shy and introverted but was also a very kindly, affectionate girl with considerable humour and flair. She had great artistic talent. In mid 2003 she was one of a very small number of people who were accepted as apprentice animators at Disney Toons from amongst a large number of applicants.
	
	
	The applicant was born on 10 August 1982 and was three years older than the victim. He was a skilled cellist, and obtained work as a musician whenever it was available. He and the victim first met on 13 April 2001. The applicant was playing the cello as part of a string quartet which performed at the wedding of the victim’s mother to her stepfather. A friendship developed which gradually became closer and more intimate. They used to regularly go out late at night and take long walks together, returning in the early hours of the morning.
	
	
	At the same time, the victim was developing a close relationship over the Internet with an American, Brandon Leonard. They both became so involved in this relationship that Mr Leonard proposed marriage to her in June 2003 which she accepted. Mr Leonard arranged to come to Australia and arrived in Sydney on 9 September, a few weeks after the victim had commenced working for Disney Toons.
	
	
	The impending arrival of Mr Leonard meant that the victim was forced to do something about her relationship with the applicant. Two days before Mr Leonard's arrival, she told the applicant that she did not want to see him any more. She did not tell him about Mr Leonard. It did not take long for the applicant to find out about Mr Leonard. Within a few days of the latter's arrival, the applicant followed the victim near her workplace when she and Mr Leonard were walking arm in arm. He later discovered that they were engaged.
	
	
	The applicant's attitude toward the victim changed dramatically when he realised that there was another man in her life. Whereas previously their relationship, although close, had been a relatively casual one, he became intense and obsessive. He told the victim’s sister that he could not live without her. He started to follow her around and was often seen waiting outside her workplace at lunchtime or when she was due to finish work.
	
	
	On Friday 21 November the victim told her mother how concerned she was about the applicant. She said:
	


“Mum I don't know what to do about Will, he won't leave me alone and I'm getting very frightened. I don't know what to do about it.""


	
	At about lunchtime, on Saturday 22 November the applicant went with his father to the Bondi Junction Shopping Centre where he purchased a very large cricket bag at the Rebel Sports Store.
	
	
	The victim's relationship with Mr Leonard flourished. They were living together in an apartment directly behind the home where her mother and stepfather lived. It was planned that the victim and Mr Leonard would go to the United States for Christmas.
	
	
	On the morning of Monday 24 November 2003 the victim went to work as usual. At lunchtime, when she left the Disney building with work friends, the applicant was waiting outside. The victim spent about ten minutes with him and then rejoined her friends. That evening she left work at the normal time (about 5.30pm) and took a train to Bondi Junction. She started to walk home from the station. The applicant was waiting for her outside the Cock & Bull Hotel, not far from the station. He later said that they walked together towards her home and then parted company near Queens Park, which was a few blocks from her home. He himself walked across Queens Park, and went straight to his own home. That night he played the cello in a concert at the Entertainment Centre. Others who were there with him described him as acting quite normally.
	
	
	The victim was never seen alive again. When she failed to come home that night and her mobile telephone did not respond to calls, the police were called. By Wednesday 26 November the matter was being treated very seriously. That day the police conducted an electronically recorded interview with the applicant, who described his movements on the Monday, and confirmed that he had last seen the victim at the corner of Edmund and Victoria Streets, Queens Park, which was not far from her home. He was asked about his relationship with the victim and he said that he was naturally upset when she broke it off, but that they had remained friends since then and had seen each other at least once a week. He said that the victim seemed perfectly normal when he last saw her. She was very excited about her proposed trip to the United States with Mr Leonard.
	
	
	The police investigations as to the whereabouts of the victim were unsuccessful until 10 January 2004. On that day, complaints from residents of an apartment block at 52 Queens Park Road, about a very bad smell in the building, led to investigations being conducted. In a storeroom off a car park on the ground floor of the building a large cricket bag was discovered containing the heavily decomposed body of the victim. Cable ties were found around her neck, indicating that the cause of death was strangulation.
	
	
	When the applicant heard of the finding of the victim's body he became extremely disturbed. On 12 January he was admitted to the ""Kiloh"" Unit, which is the Psychiatric Unit of the Prince of Wales Hospital. He was in a state of great distress: weeping and incoherent and talking about suicide. He was diagnosed as suffering from possible schizophrenia and/or possible schizotypal personality disorder, accompanied by depression. He was placed on medication for these conditions but it took some time for his condition to stabilise.
	
	
	It was not until 22 March that the applicant's treating psychiatrist said that he was fit to be interviewed by the police. Police attention was focused on the applicant at this point. Inquiries revealed that only one cricket bag of the relevant type had been sold in the whole of Sydney's Eastern Suburbs in the previous six months. The applicant’s father told the police that his son had purchased such a cricket bag.
	
	
	On 22 March 2004, a further electronically recorded interview took place between the police and the applicant. He repeated the account he had given earlier of his movements on 24 November. The police then asked him about the sports bag which he had with him when he rejoined his father on 22 November. The applicant said that he had found it in the street, and he described the precise location where he said he had found it. However, film that was taken on a security camera outside the Cock & Bull Hotel at Bondi Junction clearly contradicted this version. This film footage showed that the bag which was placed in his father’s car was the bag which had been purchased only a few minutes earlier at the Rebel Store, being the same bag which was later found to contain the body of the victim. The film demonstrated that the applicant had lied about how he acquired the bag.
	
	
	On 19 May 2004 the applicant was arrested and charged with the murder of the victim. He has been in custody ever since.
	


Sentence proceedings


	
	The primary judge reviewed the applicant’s subjective case. The applicant described himself as having a relatively happy childhood and a “wonderful” relationship with his parents.
	
	
	Her Honour noted that there were some very disturbing events during this childhood. When he was nine, his brother and only sibling, who was then seventeen years old, committed suicide by jumping off the top floor of the Prince of Wales Hospital. His brother was suffering from schizophrenia. The applicant's parents also had a history of psychiatric problems. His father, a retired school teacher, was said to have a schizotypal personality disorder and his mother also suffers from a form of personality disorder. Following her older son's death, the applicant’s mother was involuntarily committed to a psychiatric institution for a period of time. The household was described as extremely disorganised.
	
	
	The applicant completed his secondary schooling at Waverley College. This was not an enjoyable experience for him and he was the butt of serious bullying and clearly felt himself to be an outsider. Although he was said to be of above average intelligence, his scholastic results were poor to average. He remained at school for his Higher School Certificate but obtained a poor result. The one field in which he excelled was music. His mother was an accomplished cellist and he also was very skilled in this instrument.
	
	
	After leaving school the applicant worked for a time as an apprentice doing panel van conversions, but was not interested in this work and left after six months. Between then and when he was sentenced, he did no fulltime work, but did play the cello in orchestras or groups when called on to do so. When he was about thirteen or fourteen, the applicant had a period when he took cannabis in quite large doses. His auditory hallucinations commenced not long after he ceased using this drug. He had no other history of substance abuse.
	
	
	The applicant continued to take anti-psychotic and anti-depressive medication throughout his time in custody up to when he was sentenced. He was placed into protection within a few days of going into custody and her Honour found that he was likely to remain there for the foreseeable future. The applicant had been maintaining his studies in music and Latin and had regular visits from his parents.
	
	
	Two psychiatrists gave evidence on sentence, Dr Michael Giuffrida and Dr Stephen Allnutt. Dr Giuffrida noted a marked improvement in the applicant's mental state between 8 March 2005 and 3 January 2006, being the two dates on which he had seen him. In March 2005 the applicant had presented as cautious and vague with a remarkably poor recollection of events and times in the past and a significant paucity of understanding as to the meaning and significance of issues. By January 2006 Dr Giuffrida noted that he was relaxed, polite and co-operative and not at all guarded or cautious as he had been previously. Dr Giuffrida diagnosed the applicant as suffering from schizophrenia on this second occasion. Although the condition had responded reasonably to medication, a number of symptoms were still continuing.
	
	
	The applicant always maintained that he did not kill the victim and said that he had no memory of anything unusual happening between the two of them on the evening that she went missing. Dr Giuffrida posited two explanations – either the applicant was suffering from schizophrenia or due to the horrific nature of the events themselves, the applicant had developed a psychosis.
	
	
	Dr Giuffrida gave evidence in the sentence proceedings. When asked about the various elements of planning associated with the offence, such as the purchase of the sports bag two days before the murder, Dr Giuffrida agreed that this would ""tend to go against the likelihood that there was a psychotic mechanism involved in the killing."" Dr Giuffrida said that the degree of planning described to him was inconsistent with the applicant being severely psychotic, because a severely psychotic person's capacity to organise and plan was impaired.
	
	
	Dr Allnutt did not believe that the applicant’s psychiatric condition was as serious as diagnosed by Dr Giuffrida or that it played any causative role in the killing of the victim. Dr Allnutt saw the applicant on three occasions in February and March 2006. In his report and in his evidence, Dr Allnutt expressed scepticism about the diagnosis of schizophrenia in the applicant's case. He preferred a diagnosis of schizotypal personality disorder. Dr Allnutt noted that the ERISP between the police and the applicant on 26 November 2003 provided significant insight into his mental condition, less than two days after the killing. Having viewed that interview, Dr Allnutt saw little or no evidence that would lead him to conclude that the applicant was suffering from a major mental illness. Dr Allnutt noted that later on the night of the killing, the applicant went home, got changed and went to the Entertainment Centre where he played the cello in a public performance.
	
	
	Her Honour set out her conclusions as follows:
	


“32   In my view Dr Allnutt's analysis is very compelling. In the end, I find that whatever psychiatric condition the offender was suffering from at the time had little causative effect upon this killing. It might have and probably did produce some impairment of judgment, but its ameliorating effects were of a minor order only.

33   Where does all this lead to in the sentencing process? The sentencing legislation requires that the court first set a non-parole period and then the balance of the sentence which, in the absence of special circumstances, is not to exceed one third of the non-parole period. The standard non-parole period for the crime of murder is twenty years. This is applicable to offences in the middle of the range of objective seriousness for the crime in question. The objective circumstances of this case must, in my view, put it in the more serious range. Lyndsay's killing was clearly premeditated and planned. Both the buying of the sports bag and the preparation of the cable ties with which she was strangled, bear testament to this. It is therefore difficult to see it as a ""crime of passion"", as urged by the defence. The killing itself was brutal and cruel to the extreme. The cable ties used to strangle Lyndsay were such that, once in place, they could only be tightened. It was impossible to loosen or release them. We will never know the ruse by which Matheson lured Lyndsay to the place where she met her death. Once there, when she realised what was going to happen, one can only start to imagine the horror she must have suffered. It is a horror which haunts her mother and her sister to this day, as attested in their very moving victim impact statements.

…

35   All these matters lead me to conclude that the objective circumstances of this killing brings it above the mid-range of seriousness, even for the crime of murder. This is, however by no means the end of the matter. I am also obliged to take into account aggravating and mitigating features under s 21A of the relevant legislation and under the common law. The aggravating features under s  21A which are relevant to this case (and which are not inherent in the charge of murder) are, under paragraph (c), that it involved the use of a weapon, and under paragraph (n) that it was part of a planned or organised criminal activity.

36   There are no mitigating features whatsoever in relation to this offence. However there are a number in relation to the offender himself. He is still a very young man, only twenty-three years old. He was a person of prior good character with no record of previous convictions. Whilst his mental disorder may have had little causal relationship with this killing, it is still a highly relevant matter in relation to other aspects of the sentencing process, particularly relating to risk factors and to his need for continuing treatment and supervision. In this regard it is worth noting that Matheson's presentation has visibly changed since his first ERISP in November 2003. In later ERISPs his affect has been much flatter, and he has put on a great deal of weight. I can only assume that this is the product of the medication he has been taking.

37   Imprisonment is particularly harsh for this offender. Since very shortly after going into custody he has been kept in protection, and he is likely to remain there for most of, if not all, his sentence. His present regime allows him only about two hours each day outside his cell.

38   Assessing the offender's risk factor is a very difficult exercise given that we know so little about what motivated him to carry out this brutal and apparently senseless killing. Dr Giuffrida assessed it in the middle range, and in the absence of any contrary evidence I think I should accept this as generally correct. There is no doubt that Matheson will need to continue his medication, probably for the rest of his life. This, if nothing else, provides ""special circumstances"" which entitle me to vary the normal proportion between the non-parole period and the total sentence, so that his medication regime can be supervised for a significant period after his return to the community.

39   The objective seriousness of this killing is, as I have already said, above the mid-range of seriousness even for an offence of murder. On the other hand, the mitigating features relating to the offender personally, as opposed to the offence, require a significant reduction in what would otherwise be the appropriate non-parole period. …”

Events which have occurred after sentence


	
	The applicant has now been in prison for almost 11 years. Attempts were made to adjust his medication in 2008. This was unsuccessful and in early 2009 the applicant was moved to the Long Bay Prison Hospital, where he remained for 3 months. Thereafter, he returned to the Lithgow Correctional Centre and has continued to maintain a regime of medication which involves an Avanza tablet daily and Risperidone injections fortnightly. The likelihood is that the applicant will need to follow this regime for the rest of his life.
	
	
	There was no further psychiatric evidence available that addressed the applicant’s future risk of offending. The evidence on this issue remains the same as it was before the sentencing judge.
	
	
	The applicant has completed a number of courses while in prison. These include trade courses and educational courses such as Visual Art, Literature and Italian. In the applicant’s own words, as set out in his affidavit of 30 January 2014:
	


“I think that I have now taken a more peaceful and pragmatic approach to life. As an example, I remember that I was greatly depressed when I came into custody and could not play the cello. Before coming to custody, music and playing the cello was my life. I now accept that I exist as I exist and while I am in custody that means that I don’t have the same access to music.”

The applicant has the unwavering support of his parents. It is regrettable that the constraints of being in custody prevent him being allowed to play the cello.


	
	The restrictions, to which the applicant was subject when he was first imprisoned, have been moderated somewhat. Since 2007 he has been housed on a SMAP placement (Special Management Area Placement). Inmates housed in the SMAP area have full access to all services provided by Corrective Services, such as Education, Psychology, Welfare and Chaplain. The applicant since that date has been employed fulltime in the textile workshop. He has access to approximately 40 other inmates and when in his housing unit, he mixes with about 40 other inmates. The applicant is allowed out of his cell for 7 hours per day (i.e., 8.30am – 3.30pm). Inmates housed in the SMAP area have access to the gym, table tennis courts and basketball courts, as well as other activities.
	


Procedural history


	
	On 5 May 2006 the applicant filed a Notice of Intention to Appeal in respect of his conviction and sentence. An application for Legal Aid, dated 20 May 2006, was received by Legal Aid NSW. Various extensions of the Notice of Intention to Appeal were granted, the last being on 2 August 2007. Legal Aid was refused on 4 July 2007, part of the reason being based on the law at the time relating to standard non-parole periods.
	
	
	On 5 October 2011 the decision in Muldrock v R [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120 was handed down. On 29 January 2013 a merit advice was received from counsel in relation to “Muldrock error”. On 25 February 2013 Legal Aid NSW received an application for Legal Aid from the applicant, dated 18 February 2013.
	
	
	On 22 May 2013 the decision in Achurch v R (No 2) [2013] NSWCCA 117; 84 NSWLR 328 was handed down stating that the appropriate avenue of appeal in relation to “Muldrock error” was by way of leave to the Court of Criminal Appeal. On 28 June 2013 the applicant filed an Application for Leave to Appeal Against Sentence and an application for extension of time in which to seek leave. Further delay occurred while the decision in Kentwell v The Queen [2014] HCA 37; 313 ALR 451 was considered by the High Court. The effect of the High Court’s decision in Kentwell was to overrule Abdul v R [2013] NSWCCA 247 insofar as it imposed restrictions on applications for extensions of time in appeals against sentence. Following the decision in Kentwell, steps were taken to obtain a hearing date for this matter.
	


Did “Muldrock error” occur?


	
	I am satisfied that “Muldrock error” has occurred in this matter. When one looks at what the primary judge said (at [33] and [35] of her sentencing judgment) it is clear that her Honour took as a starting point the standard non-parole period and then adjusted it by reference to other considerations. This constitutes a clear example of the two step sentencing process which was expressly disapproved in Muldrock. The Crown conceded that “Muldrock error” has occurred. Accordingly, the applicant has been successful in establishing error.
	


Should an extension of time be granted?


	
	In view of the applicant’s particular circumstances, i.e. his psychiatric issues and his lack of knowledge of legal matters, there can be no personal responsibility on his part for the delay. Of necessity, he has relied entirely upon his legal advisers to progress the matter.
	
	
	By reference to the procedural history, I am of the opinion that the applicant’s legal advisers have behaved reasonably in taking the steps which they have on his behalf. Despite the substantial length of the delay, its occurrence is readily explainable. While the law was as set out in R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; 60 NSWLR 168 the approach followed by the primary judge was unexceptionable and any appeal was doomed to failure. That situation changed following Muldrock and was further refined by the decision in Kentwell. The steps taken by the applicant’s legal advisers, following the decision in Muldrock, were reasonable in the circumstances.
	
	
	Taking those matters into account, and also that “Muldrock error” has been established, I am satisfied that an extension of time for the seeking of leave to appeal against sentence should be granted. This is in accordance with the guidance provided by Kentwell, i.e., that the interests of justice require that an extension of time be granted.
	


Is a lesser sentence warranted in law?


	
	Since error has been identified in the sentence proceedings, s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 applies. Explicit guidance was provided in Kentwell as to how s 6(3) should be applied in circumstances such as these:
	


“42   … When a judge acts upon wrong principle, allows extraneous or irrelevant matters to guide or affect the determination, mistakes the facts or does not take into account some material consideration, the Court of Criminal Appeal does not assess whether and to what degree the error influenced the outcome. The discretion in such a case has miscarried and it is the duty of the Court of Criminal Appeal to exercise the discretion afresh taking into account the purposes of sentencing and the factors that the Sentencing Act, and any other Act or rule of law, require or permit. As sentencing is a discretionary judgment that does not yield a single correct result, it follows that a range of sentences in a given case may be said to be ""warranted in law"". A sentence that happens to be within the range but that has been imposed as the result of a legally flawed determination is not ""warranted in law"" unless, in the exercise of its independent discretion, the Court of Criminal Appeal determines that it is the appropriate sentence for the offender and the offence. …

43   After having identified specific error of the kind described in House, the Court of Criminal Appeal may conclude, taking into account all relevant matters, including evidence of events that have occurred since the sentence hearing, that a lesser sentence is the appropriate sentence for the offender and the offence. This is a conclusion that that lesser sentence is warranted in law. The result of the Court of Criminal Appeal's independent exercise of discretion may be the conclusion that the same sentence or a greater sentence is the appropriate sentence. In neither case is the Court required to re-sentence. …

44   … The issue for the Court's consideration was whether upon the hearing of the appeal it might conclude, taking into account the full range of factors including the evidence of the appellant's progress in custody and current mental state, that a lesser sentence is warranted in law.”

Applicant’s submissions


	
	The applicant submitted that he was a young man of 21 years with no criminal antecedents. His mental illness not only produced some impairment of judgment at the time of the offence but meant that custody would weigh more heavily upon him. These he submitted, were material factors on sentence, despite the seriousness of the offence. The applicant relied upon his conditions of custody which were still more onerous than those of the normal prison population.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that a head sentence of 27 years was inappropriate, bearing in mind his mental state at the time of the commission of the offence, and thereafter while in custody. He submitted that regard should have been had to his very dysfunctional upbringing. He submitted that by taking into account as an aggravating feature that the offence was “pre-meditated and planned”, her Honour was double counting in that she had already taken those matters into account when assessing the objective seriousness of the offence at “above the mid range of seriousness”.
	
	
	The Court’s attention was specifically drawn to the sentence judgments in R v Di Cianni and Pintabona [2013] NSWSC 1328 (RS Hulme AJ) and R v Lane [2013] NSWSC 1808 (Hidden J).
	
	
	In Di Cianni the offender was convicted of the murder of the deceased and his brother following a trial. The intended victim and the offender had been in business together for a period of time. From about 2002 the offender suspected that the intended victim was defrauding him as regards their business. Both the offender and the intended victim commenced a number of court proceedings against each other between March 2006 and April 2009.
	
	
	The offender engaged in an appreciable degree of preparation and planning before the offence. Some two days before, the offender conducted some surveillance of the premises and five minutes before the attack, the offender was observed walking up the front path of the premises disguised as “an elderly lady”.
	
	
	The offender entered the premises waiting for the intended victim to return home. The intended victim’s brother arrived first and the offender stabbed and killed him. He then moved the brother’s body out of sight. The intended victim then entered the premises where the offender killed him. As with his brother, the offender inflicted a number of stabbing wounds and blunt force injuries.
	
	
	The offender was found to have intended to kill both deceased. Both offences were assessed at “marginally above mid range”. The offences were aggravated because they were committed in the home of the deceased brothers. The offender was 66 at the time of sentence (63 at the time of the offences). The offender was assessed as unlikely to re-offend and was otherwise a man of prior good character. The finding was made that “personal deterrence, protection to the community and probably rehabilitation do not have anything like the same weight they have in the case of most murders”. The offender’s age upon his release was not taken into account as a mitigating factor. For each murder the offender was sentenced to imprisonment with a non-parole period of 20 years and a balance of term of 4 years. After allowing a degree of concurrency, the total sentence was imprisonment with a non-parole period of 30 years and a balance of term of 4 years.
	
	
	In R v Lane the deceased, who was aged 33 at the time of his death, had been in a long term relationship with Renae Burns. There had been difficulties in that relationship and in 2008 Ms Burns developed an intimate relationship with Ms Lane (the offender). The offender’s motive was to enable her relationship with Ms Burns to be pursued openly without interference from the deceased.
	
	
	Between 2008 and 2010 the offender had approached a number of people about obtaining a gun. In January 2010 she obtained a flare gun, which could be converted into a firearm by fitting a sleeve over its barrel. The deceased was shot with that weapon at close range. His body was found in a shallow grave in a nearby forest. The offender was aged 25 at the time of the murder and 29 at sentence.
	
	
	The offender had a difficult childhood and was sexually abused at the age of six. At the time of the murder she was suffering from epilepsy, post-traumatic stress disorder and depression. These conditions were thought to have had some causative effect on the offending.
	
	
	The offender was found unlikely to re-offend and her prospects of rehabilitation were good. She had no prior criminal history. She was entitled to some leniency because her mental problems would have affected her judgment to some extent. The murder was found to have been premeditated and planned over a significant period of time. But for the offender’s plea of guilty, the court would have imposed a head sentence of 25 years with a non-parole period of 18 years and 6 months.
	


Consideration


	
	Little assistance is provided by the two sentencing judgments to which the applicant referred. The offence of murder, just like the offence of manslaughter, is protean in nature with a wide array of factual circumstances. Each case is different and has to be decided on its own particular facts. These cases despite any similarities they may have with this offence, do not determine a sentencing range.
	
	
	In any event, the particular facts of these cases are quite different to those which were before the primary judge. The sentence in Di Cianni is significantly complicated by the offender’s age and the fact that two murders were involved. Similarly, the facts in Lane were quite different, except that the motivation was the elimination of a romantic rival.
	
	
	Senior Counsel for the applicant in oral submissions placed some reliance upon JIRS statistical data which formed the basis for an analysis of sentence severity – the median length of both the full term and the non-parole periods in respect of the offence of murder following the prescription of standard non-parole periods commencing on 1 February 2003. This data revealed that the median length of the full term and non-parole periods for the offence of murder was longer in the period in 1 February 2003 – 31 December 2007.
	
	
	The statistical data on which Senior Counsel for the applicant relied does not assist on the question of re-sentencing in this case being a case that requires the determination to be based upon unique circumstances of the applicant’s offending behaviour and those concerning the applicant himself, including his psychiatric condition and associated issues of risk of re-offending.
	
	
	As was made clear in Kentwell, when applying s 6(3) this Court has to independently exercise its discretion. In doing so, it is clear that the objective circumstances of this case place it in the more serious range. The element of planning and premeditation add to that conclusion. The method of killing was brutal and cruel. It follows that the overall assessment of the culpability and criminality in this offence which I have arrived at, is similar to that of the primary judge. I would certainly not interfere with the finding of a non-parole period of 18 years.
	
	
	Where I have some difficulty is with the head sentence of 27 years. Even allowing for the findings made by the primary judge and my own assessment of the facts, I have concluded that the head sentence should be one of 25 years.
	
	
	It follows that the orders which I propose are as follows:
	



	
	(1)   An extension of time for the application for leave to appeal against sentence is granted.
	
	
	(2)   Leave is granted to appeal against sentence and the appeal is allowed.
	
	
	(3)   The sentence imposed by Mathews AJ on 28 April 2006 is quashed and in lieu thereof, the applicant is sentenced to imprisonment with a non-parole period of 18 years, and a balance of term of 7 years. The non-parole period is to commence on 19 May 2004 and expire on 18 May 2022, with the balance of term to expire on 18 May 2029.

	McCALLUM J: I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.

		22 May 2015",2015-05-21 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2703376,Damoun v R [2015] NSWCCA 109,"Judgment


	
	SIMPSON J: On 1 May 2013, following a lengthy trial in the District Court, the appellant was convicted of conspiring dishonestly to cause a loss to a Commonwealth entity. That is an offence against s 135.4(3) and s 11.5(1) of the Criminal Code (Cth) and carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 10 years. A co-accused, Ali Jomaa, was tried jointly with the appellant, and was also convicted.
	
	
	On 14 November 2013 the appellant was sentenced to imprisonment for 3 years and 3 months, commencing on 10 October 2013, with a non-parole period of 2 years and 1 month. The commencement date took account of unrelated existing sentences for offences against state law. The earliest date on which the appellant will be eligible for release on parole is 9 November 2015.
	
	
	The appellant now appeals against the conviction, and seeks leave to appeal against the sentence.
	
	
	The sole ground on which he appeals against the conviction, and the sole ground on which he seeks leave to appeal against the sentence, are both narrow. In respect of the conviction, he complains that the trial judge left to the jury two possible bases of conviction that were not part of the Crown case. In respect of sentence, he complains that he was not given credit for an expressed willingness to facilitate the administration of justice by cooperating with the Crown so as to shorten the Crown case.
	


The Crown case


	
	The indictment was in the following terms:
	


“[… that Ali Jomaa and Dani Damoun (formerly known as Chehadeh Eldamouni]:

Between about 1 November 2009 and 9 March 2010 at Sydney, New South Wales and elsewhere did conspire with each other and with divers others with the intention of dishonestly causing a loss to a third person, namely a Commonwealth entity, being the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service

Particulars

(a)  Ali Jomaa entered into an agreement with one or more persons, including Dani Damoun (formerly known as Chehadeh Eldamouni);

(b)  Ali Jomaa and at least one other party to the agreement (as particularised in (a)) intended, pursuant to the agreement, to dishonestly cause a loss to a third person, namely a Commonwealth entity, being the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service;

(c)  Ali Jomaa or at least one other party to the agreement (as particularised in (a)) committed an overt act pursuant to the agreement.

Contrary to subsections 11.5(1) of the Criminal Code (Cth) (Law Part Modifier Code: 41450, [Generic Modifier Code: 51]) and 135.4 of the Criminal Code (Cth) (Law Part Code: 41505)”


	
	In essence, the Crown case was that, during the period identified in the indictment (1 November 2009 to 9 March 2010) the appellant and Mr Jomaa were participants in a conspiracy (that included “divers others” not named in the indictment) to import a large quantity of cigarettes from China in a container, the contents of which were falsely represented to the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service to be stationery. By this means the conspirators would evade the payment of customs duty that is payable on cigarettes but not on stationery. The arrangements involved the use of false shipping documents. In this respect, a cousin of Ali Jomaa (Mr Hussein Jomaa), who was employed in a freight forwarding agency, assisted. (During the course of the trial, the Crown nominated Mr Hussein Jomaa as an “unindicted co-conspirator” - one of the “divers others” referred to in the indictment.)
	
	
	The evidence presented by the Crown included evidence of significant activity on the part of the appellant associated with the importation. For example, there was evidence that, on 20 December 2009, by arrangement, the appellant met Ali Jomaa at his (Ali Jomaa’s) home, and that, later that evening, Ali Jomaa instructed the appellant to use a telecommunications service provided to him; there was evidence that, on 4 January 2010, using a false name, the appellant made contact with a real estate agent, with a view to leasing a warehouse in which to store the container when it arrived in Australia and had cleared customs. The appellant was at all times in close contact with Mr Jomaa. There was evidence that, between 6 and 9 January 2010, the appellant was involved in a number of telephone calls with Mr Jomaa, and that on 10 February 2010, he signed a lease for the rent of a warehouse in Condell Park. In doing so he used the same false name as he previously used. The appellant paid a cash deposit for the formalisation of the customs clearing process. There was evidence that the appellant was involved with Hussein Jomaa and others in the creation of false shipping documents; that he used multiple mobile telephones for communication with Hussein Jomaa and others; that he communicated using coded language; and that he delivered false shipping documents. Given the narrow area of factual dispute in the trial, the jury verdict, and the equally narrow issues on the appeal, it is unnecessary to expand further on the detail of the prosecution allegations of fact.
	


The defence case


	
	That the appellant had engaged in the acts alleged against him was not in dispute. The appellant’s defence was that he was unaware of the illicit nature of the arrangement, and was unaware that the importation was of cigarettes. In other words, he was an innocent dupe. He gave evidence in the trial to that effect.
	


The trial


	
	The Crown prosecutor opened the Crown case to the jury, outlining the nature of its allegations, and the evidence he anticipated would be given, which was substantially in accordance with what has been outlined above.
	
	
	At the conclusion of the Crown opening, counsel for the two accused briefly opened the defence cases. Counsel for the appellant made it clear that the factual allegations against the appellant were not in dispute. He said:
	


“The issue is a simple one for Mr Dani Damoun; was he aware that when he was moving documents between two other people, who you will not see, was he aware as to what he was doing? Is his behaviour afterwards consistent with him knowing? Was there a flurry of phone calls when the shipment got stopped from his mobile phone, or was there no reaction?

Ladies and gentlemen, that is the issue: Dani Damoun, all about knowledge and when he was doing certain things, which are not in any way challenged, why he was doing it and for what purpose …”

The trial proceeded on that identified issue.


	
	During the course of cross-examination of the Crown witnesses, another name emerged. This was Ahmed Masri. It was not part of the Crown case that Masri was a participant in the conspiracy. The Crown position was that Masri was a distributor of cigarettes, and not involved in the conspiracy. That remained its position throughout the trial. By contrast, it was the appellant’s case that Masri was heavily involved in the conspiracy, indeed “the driving force”. That was also the case advanced on behalf of the co-accused, Ali Jomaa. They produced evidence that Masri had been charged with similar offences committed in 2011. Counsel for the appellant directed a substantial part of his final address to the proposition that Masri was:
	


“… the driving force of this importation, the person who has to go back to investors, the people who bought in it, cost a lot of money …”


	
	I will refer in more detail below to the specific aspects of the addresses, and the jury directions, when considering the two matters argued on the appeal against conviction.
	


The appeal against conviction


	
	The sole ground of appeal against conviction concerns the trial judge’s directions to the jury. It is framed as follows:
	


“1.  A miscarriage of justice occurred by virtue of the trial judge leaving to the jury a possible basis of conviction which had not been relied on by the Crown.”


	
	In fact, there were two limbs to this ground of appeal. The complaints concern:
	


(i)  the directions given in relation to the timing of a participant joining a conspiracy; and

(ii)  a direction given to the jury that they could convict if satisfied that Mr Damoun conspired with a person not named in the indictment, and not relied upon by the Crown as a participant in the conspiracy, Ahmed Masri.

(i)  late joining of conspiracy


	
	Included in the transcript of the Crown’s opening is the following:
	


“It is the Crown’s case that Mr Damoun is Ali Jomaa[’s] right-hand man effectively. He often does things at the direction of Ali Jomaa, including working with Ali Jomaa in this cigarette distribution business. For instance, he is the one in Australia actively finding and leasing the warehouse. He is seen at this warehouse with the tobacco products or tobacco smell that is identified [as] where these boxes are being stored. He also hires the truck which is used to transport around these boxes that are in the warehouse that smells of tobacco.”

and:

“And I expect you’ll hear by, way of telephone intercepts, telephone calls that relate to the process of getting shipping documents and making those shipping documents available to Ali Jomaa and Dani Damoun and that process starts on 20 December 2009.

I expect you’ll hear a telephone call from Ali Jomaa to Dani Damoun where he requests that Dani Damoun meet him at this house at approximately 7.25pm, to when that was [sic] call made. On 20 December 2009 Dani Damoun leaves two voice messages on Hussein Jomaa’s telephone, effectively stating that he is Ali Jomaa’s friend and asking for Hussein Jomaa to contact him back on the number he’s calling from which is a mobile telephone number …”


	
	At the commencement of the Crown’s closing address, in relation to the element of intention, the Crown prosecutor said:
	


“Well, again, the Crown submission is that you would be able to look at the purposeful acts undertaken by each of the accused, Ali Jomaa, Dani Damoun, over a two month period from the 20th of December at least, through to the end of February where they’re both undertaking acts to ensure that this container is imported into the country without it being discovered what its true contents are. And that because of those purposeful acts you would conclude they intended the offence to be committed.”


	
	He went on to itemise evidence upon which the Crown relied to prove participation by the appellant, with specific reference to a number of telephone calls over January, February, and March 2010. He referred to various other acts of the appellant.
	
	
	Counsel for the appellant then addressed. After he had concluded his final address, counsel for the appellant was provided with a draft of written directions the judge was proposing to give to the jury. The draft directions are not before this Court. Counsel protested vigorously about a proposed direction contained therein, concerning what he called possible “late joinder”. He asserted that the Crown had never raised the possibility of late participation, and that:
	


“The Crown case has been explicit, clear, consistent that this conspiracy commenced on 20 December.”


	
	He referred expressly to the passage of the Crown opening extracted above, where the Crown prosecutor spoke of a meeting on 20 December between Ali Jomaa and the appellant. He claimed that had he known that “late joinder” was to be a relevant matter, he would have addressed differently (although he did not specify how).
	
	
	Counsel for the appellant referred to what he described as an invitation by the Crown that his Honour give a direction about late participation in a conspiracy as “a path of the guilt”. He contended that, in the context of this case, such a direction should not be given. He said:
	


“My whole closing was based on the premise that the Crown said there was a meeting on 20th December [2009] where all is explained. My closing has no effect.”


	
	The Crown prosecutor responded:
	


“As far as the Crown case and the closing, [counsel for the appellant] characterised it correctly, if that creates issues that fit within the law about that, then the Crown should be stuck with it. That’s what it boils down to.”


	
	At an early stage in his summing up, his Honour provided to the jury written directions of law that extended to almost four pages. Relevant to this part of the appeal was the following:
	


“The law does not require proof that each of the co-conspirators entered the agreement at the same time or left it at the same time. All that is necessary is that a person who enters an existing agreement, must join in for the purpose of that agreement.”


	
	The direction given orally by the judge was:
	


“The law does not require proof that each of the conspirators or co-conspirators entered the agreement at the same time or left at the same time. All that is necessary is that a person who enters an existing agreement must join in the purpose of that agreement.

So, the law provides that somebody - let us say that you are convinced, again not in this case, that my hypothetical conspiracy of ten people, that that started in January and people were taking steps to put it into effect in December. But that conspirators 9 and 10 only became involved at the tail end - if it is a drug conspiracy let us say carrying suitcases into the country - now provided 9 and 10 have entered the same agreement to import that drug in the case that I have put to you, albeit well after January - say in November, December - then they can be convicted of being party to that criminal agreement.

So, in that sense, ladies and gentlemen, provided the agreement you find is the same agreement as to which there is agreement by the co-conspirators, it is not necessary that the person you are considering entered into, at the very first day; he or she may have entered in the middle or close to the end before the conspiracy was completed.”


	
	The appellant’s submissions at trial were essentially repeated on appeal. They were to the effect that the Crown case was that the appellant “was a participant from the outset”, and did not countenance the possibility that he joined at some later stage. In the appellant’s written submissions, the response of the Crown prosecutor (extracted above at [21]) was interpreted as a concession that the Crown case had been that “the appellant was a participant from the outset”, and that that was essential to the Crown case. The direction (at [22] above) was therefore contrary to the case the Crown presented to the jury. I do not read the Crown prosecutor’s answer as such a concession, although it is not easy to know what it does mean.
	
	
	The Crown’s response is simply that the direction as to timing was a standard direction, and did not invite the jury to conclude that the appellant had joined the conspiracy at some time other, and later, than December 20, 2009.
	


Resolution


	
	The Crown position is correct. The direction as to the timing of any participant joining a conspiracy is a standard one. Of course, directions have to be tailored to the case that is made, and the Crown accepts that the meeting of 20 December 2009 was an important part of the Crown case. However, I do not see that the Crown case depended upon the jury accepting that evidence, and, nor do I see that, if for some reason the jury did not accept that that meeting took place, the other evidence was insufficient to establish the appellant’s participation. Nor can I see that the appellant adopted a position on an understanding that, unless he was shown to have been involved by 20 December 2009, he could not be convicted.
	
	
	A conspiracy charge proceeds on the basis of evidence of a number - sometimes a very large number - of overt acts. It is seldom necessary that any of those acts be proved beyond reasonable doubt (see Shepherd v The Queen [1990] HCA 56; 170 CLR 573, with reference to circumstantial evidence) and it is seldom that the Crown case depends upon proof of entry into a conspiracy at a particular time during the range of dates specified in the indictment. Certainly that was not here the case.
	
	
	It was always open to the jury to find that any one or more of the overt acts alleged against the appellant was or were sufficient to establish his part in the conspiracy. It was not necessary for proof of the Crown case that the appellant be shown to have joined the conspiracy by 20 December. In any event, the appellant did not contest that he had had the meeting of 20 December - as set out above, he acknowledged all the acts and activities alleged against him. No unfairness was done to the appellant by the direction.
	
	
	In my opinion the first limb of Ground 1 ought to be rejected.
	


(ii)  Masri as a co-conspirator


	
	As mentioned above, it was the appellant and his co-accused who raised an issue of Masri’s possible involvement in the conspiracy; the appellant’s counsel focussed heavily upon that proposition in his final address.
	
	
	During the course of the discussion that followed the appellant’s counsel’s address, in answer to a question from the trial judge as to whether he had anything to add, the Crown prosecutor said:
	


“Your Honour, I do. It is the issue which telegraphs in relation to how your Honour would be dealing with Ahmed Masri. We have now heard from [counsel for the appellant]. He has made positive assertions that Ahmed Masri is a co-conspirator in relation to this conspiracy. It’s got to be the same conspiracy prima facie on the closing address of [counsel]. And this has been raised in fairness to how [counsel for Ali Jomaa] may address the issues for Ali Jomaa.

In my submission given the closing of [counsel for the appellant] your Honour is going to have to give the jury some guidance about whether or not guilty verdicts can be brought in for either of these two person [sic] if he is a person in the conspiracy. It is unavoidable, given the way the matter has been raised …” (as transcribed)


	
	Counsel for the appellant sought a direction to the effect that, if the jury were to conclude that a conspiracy involving Masri in relation to either the appellant or Ali Jomaa was proved, the verdict must be not guilty. He said that the argument was essentially about the Crown changing its case. He put:
	


“That your Honour should direct the jury that the Crown have brought a case in which Mr Masri is not a conspirator. If you come to the conclusion that Mr Masri was a party to the conspiracy here you are to return a verdict of not guilty. That is my application.”

There was more discussion along similar lines.


	
	Although, it seems, the Crown prosecutor considered whether he should change his position that Masri was an innocent distributor, and seek to include him in the category of “divers others” mentioned in the indictment, he opted against that course, and maintained the Crown’s original position. He did, however, urge that the trial judge give some guidance to the jury as to what they could do with the evidence concerning Masri. He said:
	


“But I think that it is important that the jury eventually do understand that the agreement just needs to be with the parties who are identified. And now Mr Masri has been clear[ly] identified as one of those parties.

In my submission your Honour is going to have to give them some guidance along the lines of, even if you conclude that Mr Masri is a participant in the conspiracy and also conclude that both Ali Jomaa and Dani Damoun are, then that doesn’t affect their ability to come to a guilty verdict in relation to those accused.”


	
	Counsel for the appellant provided a draft direction which he submitted ought be given to the jury. It was in the following terms:
	


“In this trial, the Crown alleges that there was an agreement to defraud the Commonwealth between Ali Jomma [sic], Dani Damoun and Hussein Jomaa.

The Crown do not assert that Mr Masri was a participant to this agreement but rather that he in relation to this importation his interest was limited to an unknown role in relation to the shipping documents and as a potential domestic distributor of the cigarettes.

On behalf of Mr Damoun, in particular, it has been suggested that Mr Masri’s role was far greater. It has been argued that the evidence suggests that he was involved in the importation by way of researching custom techniques, acquiring the false shipping documents and arranging finance. It has been argued that the telephone intercept material has Mr Masri admitting to the importation subject to the indictment and other importations of counterfeit cigarettes. Indeed it was said that he was amongst the true conspirators.

What actual role Mr Masri played in the series of events both before and after the arrival of the container is a matter for you. It may be relevant to your assessment as to how the container arrived and the interrelationship between the named parties on the indictment. In this way, his role, however you may determine it to be, may assist you in the ultimate question as to whether the Crown has satisfied you beyond a reasonable doubt that there was an agreement between at least two of the three conspirators identified by the Crown.

Consequently, I direct you that if the only agreement you are satisfied with beyond a reasonable doubt was one between Mr Masri and one of the accused you are to return a verdict of not guilty. Specifically, if you were only satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that there was a conspiracy between Mr Damoun and Mr Masri you are to return a verdict of not guilty for each accused. Equally, if you were only satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that there was an agreement between Mr Ali Jomaa and Mr Masri you are to return verdicts of not guilty for each accused.” (italics added)


	
	In written submissions filed in the appeal, it was put that:
	


“… the Crown submitted that it was incumbent upon the trial judge to direct the jury that they could convict if they came to the conclusion that the appellant [or Mr Ali Jomaa] conspired with Mr Masri separately.”


	
	This is not how I read the passages extracted from the Crown prosecutor’s submissions. He did not submit that the appellant (or Ali Jomaa) could be convicted if the jury considered that either of them (but not the other) conspired with Masri. His submission was that the introduction of the notion of Masri as a participant in the conspiracy did not preclude a finding of guilt against either of the appellant or Ali Jomaa, provided they were found to have conspired either with one another or with Hussein Jomaa (or both). A finding that either of them also conspired with Masri (contrary to the Crown’s position) would not affect their guilt.
	
	
	However, the direction given to the jury was as follows:
	


“I want to give this direction in the way that this case has unfolded. The Crown has submitted that a further co-conspirator is Mr Hussein Jomaa, that formed part of his closing address to you. Counsel for the accused Mr Damoun has submitted that Ahmed Masri a person who has been named often in this case, is a co-conspirator. It is a matter for you as judges of the facts as to whether you accept or reject those arguments put by counsel. If however you are satisfied that either Mr Hussein Jomaa or Mr Ahmed Masri, if either one of them was a co-conspirator, you must be satisfied of that fact beyond a reasonable doubt. If you do not accept that either Mr Hussein Jomaa or Ahmed Masri was a co-conspirator beyond a reasonable doubt then you will conclude that they are not parties to the agreement and you set them aside for this purpose.

Now these directions ladies and gentlemen I am about to give you apply only if you conclude that the two accused presently before the Court were not party to the same agreement, otherwise they do not come into operation. In those circumstances if you conclude that either Mr Hussein Jomaa or Mr Ahmed Masri was a co-conspirator, in order to find the accused’s case who you are considering guilty, you must unanimously agree, that is all of you, the twelve agree that he, in this case if we are considering Mr Damoun’s case, Mr Damoun or if we consider Mr Jomaa’s case, Mr Jomaa’s case conspired with the same alleged co-conspirator.

So the example is this, if you are not satisfied that Mr Damoun conspired with Mr Jomaa, the two accused presently before the Court. But part of you, let us say six to pluck a figure, concluded that he conspired with Mr Hussein Jomaa and the other six concluded that the [sic] conspired with Mr Ahmed Masri, then you must find him not guilty. The obligation is that the twelve of you must find that he conspired with the same person, either Mr Ahmed Masri or Mr Hussein Jomaa or both. But if half of you are not convinced he conspired with the same person you must find him not guilty.” (italics added)


	
	The complaint made on behalf of the appellant is expressed in the written submissions as follows:
	


“43  With respect to the expansion of the participants to the conspiracy, the direction undercut the thrust of the defence submission which was to the effect that by alleviating [sic - elevating] the role of Mr Masri the jury may have doubt with respect to the level of awareness and knowledge of the appellant.

44  Rather than being a path to creating doubt, his Honour [sic] directions allowed the jury to elevate the role of Mr Masri as a means to convicting the appellant.

45  The timing of the direction precluded the defence from submitting upon the issue of Mr Masri as a participant to a conspiracy which could lead to a conviction.”

Resolution


	
	In my opinion, the complaint is not open to the appellant. The appellant’s counsel took a considered forensic decision to implicate Masri as the “driving force” behind the conspiracy. He cannot now be heard to complain that appropriate directions were not given with respect to the evidence he had introduced. Even if the jury accepted that Masri was “the driving force”, and was involved, such a conclusion did not have the necessary effect that the applicant was ignorant of what he was involved in. Nor did it make the conspiracy different to that which the Crown alleged.
	
	
	There is, in my opinion, a potential difficulty in the direction that the jury could convict the appellant (or Ali Jomaa) if it was not satisfied that the two accused were party to the same agreement, but that either of them had conspired with Masri. Since Masri, as a conspirator, was no part of the Crown case, that direction was erroneous. The appellant could not have been convicted of conspiring with Masri, if he were not found also to have conspired with Ali Jomaa, or Hussein Jomaa. But if he were found to have conspired with either of those, the fact (if it were the fact) that the jury considered that Masri was also part of the conspiracy was of no moment.
	
	
	The erroneous direction was of no effect. That is because it was preceded by a clear direction it was applicable only if the jury concluded that the appellant and Ali Jomaa were not party to the same agreement (see the italicised passage in the direction). By its verdicts of guilty of both accused, the jury showed that the erroneous direction had no bearing on the outcome.
	
	
	In my opinion the second limb of Ground 1 ought to be rejected.
	
	
	It follows that, in my opinion, the appeal against conviction must fail.
	


The application for leave to appeal against sentence


	
	The proposed ground of appeal against sentence is framed as follows:
	


“2.  His Honour erred in failing to discount the sentence by virtue of the applicant’s offer to conduct the trial by way of an agreed statement of facts.”


	
	Prior to the trial, counsel for the appellant proposed that the length of the trial could be significantly shortened by the tender of agreed facts and playing of audio tapes. This did not eventuate because of resistance on the part of Ali Jomaa.
	
	
	It is now submitted that, having regard to his willingness to facilitate the course of justice, that was a matter that should have been taken into account on sentence. Reliance was placed upon the decision of Whealy J in R v Elomar [2010] NSWSC 10, to that effect and De Campos v R [2006] NSWCCA 51. At sentence, the Crown accepted that this was a relevant consideration, but not one that should “overwhelm the objective seriousness [of] the offence”.
	
	
	Counsel for the appellant relied upon a passage in the Remarks on Sentence, in which the sentencing judge acknowledged the submission and the citation of Elomar and De Campos, and said:
	


“In both those cases, the single Supreme Court judge in the first and the Court of Appeal in the second, recognise that even though the police do not take up the offer of assistance some recognition of it should be made as an indication of a person’s intention to assist justice. I accept those as statements of principle which are binding upon me. In my opinion the question of assistance however needs to be assessed for its utility, which is clearly not determinative, the truthfulness of the offender’s version and the completeness of that version. If it is the case that qualified assistance is offered, in effect disclosing that which is already known, in my opinion the offer of assistance should be regarded circumspectly. In my judgment that situation applies in the present offer.”


	
	The observations, however, were made with reference to an offer of assistance to law enforcement authorities, in relation to proposed further prosecutions of co-offenders. They were not made in relation to the offer of cooperating in order to shorten the trial.
	
	
	Although it falls short of conceding error, the Crown has not argued against the proposition that the course taken by the sentencing judge was erroneous. It submitted, however, that no lesser effective head sentence or non-parole period is warranted.
	
	
	In my opinion, that stance itself represents error. If error is established, the obligation of this Court is to exercise afresh the sentencing discretion. This is to be done, not with a starting point of the sentence imposed by the sentencing judge, but having regard to the whole range of relevant sentencing factors: Kentwell v The Queen [2014] HCA 37; 313 ALR 451, and see Davis v R [2015] NSWCCA 90.
	
	
	A willingness (unfulfilled for reasons not attributable to the offender) to facilitate the course of justice by cooperating with a view to shortening proceedings may, in appropriate circumstances, be a relevant sentencing consideration. It is not, however, a consideration that bears upon the selection of sentences in all cases. A sentencing judge is best placed to know how to deal with such an unfulfilled willingness. Here the sentencing judge was not obliged to place any weight upon the appellant’s offer. There was no error in the sentencing procedure.
	
	
	I would grant leave to appeal against sentence but dismiss the appeal.
	
	
	The orders I propose are:
	



	
	Appeal against conviction dismissed;
	
	
	Leave granted to appeal against sentence;
	
	
	Appeal against sentence dismissed.
	



	
	PRICE J: I agree with Simpson J.
	
	
	McCALLUM J: I agree with Simpson J.

Judgment


	
	WARD JA: The appellant (to whom I will refer as Ms B in order to preserve the anonymity of her child) was convicted on 29 May 2014 of an offence against s 65Y of the Family Law Act 1975 (Cth).
	
	
	The conduct that gave rise to her conviction was that, as she admitted, on 24 April 2008, Ms B took her child, then aged three years and eight months, out of Australia at a time when she knew that an interim parenting order of the Family Court of Australia was in force, providing for the child to spend supervised time at a contact centre with the child’s father (Ms B’s then husband, to whom I will refer as Mr B). Ms B knew both that Mr B had not consented to the removal of the child from the jurisdiction and that there was no Court order permitting this to occur. Ms B’s evidence was that she did not know that in acting as she did she was committing a criminal offence, though she accepts that ignorance of the law was no defence.
	
	
	Ms B’s evidence was, and the trial judge accepted, that at the time Ms B took her child out of the country she believed that he had been sexually abused by Mr B and had formed the view that there had not been, and would not be, a proper investigation into the sexual abuse allegations. She believed that her son was suffering ongoing harm during or as a result of the supervised contact sessions that had been ordered by the Family Court. She also believed that an order for unsupervised access was imminent and that the only way to protect her son was to take him out of the country. She thought that in Europe she would be able to obtain a proper investigation of her son and would then be in a position to “negotiate” their return to Australia. Once in Europe, she recorded a number of conversations with her son in which she maintains her son made further unsolicited disclosures of abuse by his father prior to their departure for Europe. These disclosures, she maintains, show the objective reasonableness of her concerns.
	
	
	The child was located in Amsterdam in September 2010, following internet and media publicity. Ms B was arrested and the child was placed in a child care crisis centre. Mr B, in whose favour a custody order had been made by the Family Court in Ms B’s absence after Ms B took their child out of the jurisdiction, brought the child back to Australia in late 2010. Orders have since been made giving him sole parental custody and responsibility of the child.
	
	
	Ms B was extradited back to Australia in 2011 and prosecuted in the District Court before a jury of twelve for the s 65Y offence, for which a maximum penalty of three years’ imprisonment applies.
	
	
	Following Ms B’s conviction for that offence, and a sentencing hearing held before the trial judge, Woodburne SC DCJ, an order was made pursuant to s 20(1)(a) of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) that Ms B be released upon agreeing to give security (without a surety) in the amount of $500, on recognisance, to be of good behaviour for a period of 28 days. That good behaviour bond expired, apparently without incident, some time ago.
	
	
	Ms B now appeals from her conviction and seeks leave to appeal from her sentence. The principal ground of appeal in respect of her conviction relates to the decision by the trial judge that Ms B had not satisfied the evidential burden necessary for the two defences Ms B wished to raise (of sudden or extraordinary emergency and of self-defence) to be considered by the jury. As to the outcome of her sentencing hearing, Ms B does not make any complaint as to the imposition of a good behaviour bond on her. Rather, she contends that the sentencing judge erred in not permitting her during the course of that hearing to cross-examine Mr B on his victim impact statement (which she wished to do in order to establish that he was not a victim but the perpetrator of the alleged sexual abuse), and that her Honour erred in not making a positive finding that she, Ms B, does not suffer from a delusional disorder (that having been the conclusion reached by a Family Court appointed expert in the context of ongoing Family Court proceedings following her return).
	
	
	For the reasons set out below, I am of the view that Ms B’s conviction appeal should be dismissed and that leave should be granted for the sentence appeal but that appeal should also be dismissed.
	


Preliminary observations


	
	Ms B was represented by successive firms of lawyers at the time the relevant parenting order was made (in February 2008) and at the time she took the child out of the country (in April 2008). She was also legally represented during part of the criminal proceedings. However, by the time of the trial and subsequent sentencing hearing, for reasons that are not apparent on the material before this Court, Ms B was not legally represented. Nor did Ms B have the benefit of legal representation on this appeal.
	
	
	It is evident from a close review of the transcript of the trial proceedings that the trial judge was at pains to ensure that procedural matters were explained to Ms B and that, so far as possible, the disadvantage faced by Ms B as a self-represented accused was minimised. No criticism could be or has been made as to the manner in which her Honour conducted those proceedings. Indeed, Ms B has commended her Honour’s patience during the proceedings.
	
	
	In the present proceedings, considerable latitude has been afforded to Ms B in the provision by her of successive sets of submissions, including submissions after judgment was reserved. There has been a degree of duplication of material across the five volumes of appeal books, the respective sets of submissions filed by Ms B, her affidavit dated 17 November 2014 (the ‘November affidavit’), and subsequent submissions filed in February 2015.
	
	
	Where reliance has been placed by Ms B on material coming into existence, or events arising, after the conclusion of the criminal proceedings (that necessarily not having been in evidence before the District Court), such as some of the material included in the November affidavit, that will be treated as being by way of submission. Further, as the Crown did not have an opportunity to cross-examine Ms B on her November affidavit (which was filed following the grant of leave for further submissions to be filed going to the way in which Ms B had sought to re-cast ground 2 on the appeal), that too will only be treated as a submission except insofar as it incorporates matters that were in evidence at the trial. So that there is no misunderstanding, however, I would have reached the same conclusions even had that material been tendered formally on this appeal.
	


Allegations of sexual or other abuse


	
	It is not necessary at this point to set out in detail the allegations made by Ms B of sexual or other abuse of her son by Mr B. A summary of those allegations, the accuracy of which was largely not disputed, was included as Annexure A to her Honour’s reasons on sentencing.
	
	
	Those allegations had, by the time of the trial, expanded considerably beyond the allegations that Ms B had made at the time that she took her son from the country. For example, by the time of the trial, there were allegations by Ms B of ritual abuse involving the wearing of masks as well as an allegation that Mr B had physically abused his son and had on one occasion defecated on his face. Obviously, disclosures made by the child to Ms B after his removal from the country, and conclusions drawn by her from those disclosures, could not have informed Ms B’s state of mind at the time of commission of the act that constituted the offence. Nevertheless, Ms B relied at the trial on her son’s post-April 2008 disclosures as evidence that her son was making disclosures consistent with those of someone who had been sexually abused, not as to the truth of the allegations. She maintains that events after she took her son out of the country, including what has happened since his return to the country, demonstrate with hindsight the objective reasonableness of her conduct.
	
	
	It must be noted that there has been no determination as to the truth or otherwise of the allegations of sexual abuse made by Ms B. Her Honour made clear to the jury that the criminal proceedings against Ms B were not the occasion for a determination as to whether or not any sexual abuse had occurred and at the outset of the trial Ms B disavowed any intention to ask the jury to reach any such conclusion. Mr B has not been charged with any criminal offence in that regard. Nothing in these reasons is to be taken as any comment on whether or not any or all of Ms B’s allegations have any valid foundation.
	
	
	What was of relevance in the criminal proceedings, given the defences that Ms B wished to raise, was Ms B’s state of mind or belief at the time she took her child out of the country; the objective reasonableness of her belief that removal of the child from the country was the only reasonable response to the sudden or extraordinary emergency that she believed had arisen; and the objective reasonableness of her response to the circumstances as she perceived them (to paraphrase the relevant elements of the two defences that she sought to raise).
	


Background


	
	The relevant events leading up to Ms B’s departure from the country and the evidence that Ms B gave as to the advice she had received in the period from 6 December 2007 to her departure, as well as the events following her departure, are summarised in the appendix to these reasons. Suffice it at this stage to note that Ms B made a conscious decision to take her child out of the country, though she says it was not a voluntary choice because she had a duty as a mother to protect her son. She maintains that she needed to leave Australia in order to obtain a proper investigation of the abuse allegations, although ironically her decision to leave Australia with her son seems to have had the practical outcome that there was then no investigation at all of the allegations, at least not while she and her son were in Europe.
	


Conviction appeal


	
	On her conviction appeal, Ms B made it clear that she regarded the key issues in the trial proceedings (and in this appeal) as relating to the harm to her child; the allegations of abuse; the mental condition of her former husband and risk of “familicide”; and the failure of the authorities to investigate and provide her child with protection. Her fundamental complaint is that her child should not have been allowed to have any contact with his father at all until proper investigations into the sexual abuse allegations had been completed.
	
	
	Ms B raised three grounds of appeal against her conviction: first, as to the decision by the trial judge not to permit her defences to be left to the jury; second, as to rulings made by the trial judge preventing evidence to be adduced going to the issue whether the sexual abuse allegations were correct; and, third, as to the admissibility of the report she had received from the Family Court appointed expert, Dr Waters, shortly before her departure from the country (“Dr Waters’ report”).
	


Ground 1 – evidential burden


	
	At trial, Ms B sought to defend the charge on two grounds: first, that, at the time she took her child out of the country, circumstances of extraordinary emergency existed and her response was, she believed, the only reasonable response to those circumstances of emergency (the “sudden or extraordinary emergency” defence under s 10.3 of the Criminal Code 1995 (Cth)); and, second, on the ground of self-defence (s 10.4 of the Criminal Code).
	
	
	There was discussion at the outset of the trial as to the evidential burden that Ms B was required to meet before those defences could be left to the jury. Her Honour heard evidence going to those defences (some of which was in the absence of the jury) before ruling on the availability of the defences. Ms B was directed not to make express reference to the defences in her opening address to the jury. It was not until the Crown case had closed and all of the oral evidence for the defence had been heard that her Honour ruled on the availability of the defences.
	


Defences


	
	Section 10.3 of the Criminal Code (the sudden or extraordinary emergency defence) provides that:
	


(1)   A person is not criminally responsible for an offence if he or she carries out the conduct constituting the offence in response to circumstances of sudden or extraordinary emergency.

(2)   This section applies if and only if the person carrying out the conduct reasonably believes that:

(a)   circumstances of sudden or extraordinary emergency exist; and

(b)   committing the offence is the only reasonable way to deal with the emergency; and

(c)   the conduct is a reasonable response to the emergency.


	
	The sudden or extraordinary emergency defence requires not just a subjective belief on the part of the accused (i.e., here, Ms B) as to each of the matters in sub-sections 2(a), (b) and (c) but also that such belief be objectively reasonable.
	
	
	Section 10.4 of the Criminal Code (self-defence) provides that:
	


(1)   A person is not criminally responsible for an offence if he or she carries out the conduct constituting the offence in self-defence.

(2)   A person carries out conduct in self-defence if and only if he or she believes the conduct is necessary:

(a)   to defend himself or herself to another person;

…

and the conduct is a reasonable response in the circumstances as he or she perceives them.

…

(4)   This section does not apply if:

(a)   the person is responding to lawful conduct; and

(b)   he or she knew that the conduct was lawful.

However, conduct is not lawful merely because the person carrying it out is not criminally responsible for it.


	
	Again, this defence requires not just a subjective belief on the part of the accused but also that the conduct be, objectively, a reasonable response (in the circumstances as the accused perceives them). The Crown argued in the present case that the defence was inapplicable because the supervised contact visits, which Ms B maintained were causing deterioration in her son’s behaviour, were lawful. However, her Honour did not exclude the availability of the defence on that ground.
	
	
	Section 13.3(3) of the Criminal Code provides that a defendant who wishes to deny criminal responsibility by relying on a provision of Part 2.3 (in which Part of the Criminal Code ss 10.3 and 10.4 are contained) bears an evidential burden in relation to that matter.
	
	
	Evidential burden is defined in s 13.3(6) of the Criminal Code to mean “the burden of adducing or pointing to evidence that suggests a reasonable possibility that the matter exists or does not exist”. Where a defendant discharges the evidential burden in relation to a defence, then the prosecution bears the legal burden of negativing the defence beyond reasonable doubt (ss 13.1(2), 13.2(1)).
	
	
	The question whether the evidential burden has been discharged is a question of law for the judge (The Queen v Khazaal [2012] HCA 26; (2012) 246 CLR 601 per French CJ at [13]). In Khazaal, the High Court considered what was required in order for an accused to discharge an evidential burden (there in relation to an exception from liability contained in s 101.5(5) of the Criminal Code). The plurality (Gummow, Crennan and Bell JJ) held (at [74]) that the operative words in s 13.3(6) required not more than slender evidence. Their Honours did not consider it necessary to determine whether the words “reasonable possibility” excluded evidence which suggested no more than a mere possibility or a bare possibility.
	
	
	In the present case, her Honour ruled that Ms B had not satisfied the evidential burden in relation to either of the two defences. Her Honour published written reasons for that ruling.
	
	
	In those reasons, her Honour had regard to the nature of the evidential burden imposed on Ms B, as considered in Khazaal, and to the nature of the test to be applied when determining a defence based on reasonable belief (referring to Oblach v R [2005] NSWCCA 440; (2005) 65 NSWLR 75; (2005) 158 A Crim R 586).
	
	
	Ms B’s first ground on her conviction appeal asserts error on the part of the trial judge in ruling that she had not satisfied the evidential burden necessary for the defences she wished to raise to be left to the jury:
	


Her Honour erred in withholding my defences from the jury on the ground that I had a right of appeal and therefore the evidence was not capable of supporting the possibility that I reasonably believed that committing the offence was the only reasonable way to deal with the emergency and on the ground that my conduct was not a reasonable response in the circumstances as I perceived them because I had the right to be heard at any hearing for a parenting application and the right to appeal the decision (Judgment R v B (No 2) at [108], s 10.3(2)(b) at [130] and [134] – s 10.4(2) of the Code respectively).


	
	The question for her Honour (as articulated by French CJ in Khazaal at [19]) was whether the evidence relied upon by Ms B was incapable of suggesting the reasonable possibility necessary to satisfy the evidential burden on Ms B. Her Honour clearly had regard to the correct test in that respect. Further, it is clear from her Honour’s reasons that her Honour approached that task with the trial judge’s appropriate reluctance when considering the withholding of potential defences from the jury.
	


Sudden or extraordinary emergency


	
	As to the “sudden or extraordinary emergency” defence (for which, as Simpson J notes at [216] below, Ms B asserted only the existence of an “extraordinary” emergency), the question for this Court is whether her Honour erred in concluding that the evidence was not capable of suggesting the reasonable possibility that Ms B reasonably believed that taking her child out of the country was the only reasonable way to deal with the emergency and that she reasonably believed that this was a reasonable response to the emergency.
	
	
	As to the nature of that emergency, Simpson J has pointed (at [280] below) to Ms B’s articulation of this before the trial judge (on 14 October 2013, in the absence of the jury, at T35-37) as one concerning the apprehension that Mr B was potentially homicidal and that she and her child were in physical danger. However, as Simpson J has noted, Ms B’s response when asked to identify the emergency in this case was lengthy discursive and not easy to understand. In the course of that response Ms B also referred to the deterioration of her son’s behaviour in the course of the supervised contact visits. The evidence that Ms B gave at the trial, and her communications while in Europe with an academic in Adelaide (Professor Briggs), as to the reason that she left the country focussed largely on her concerns as to the alleged sexual abuse and imminence of unsupervised access by Mr B to his son, coupled with her belief that there would be no proper investigation of the alleged abuse. I have therefore approached the matter on the basis that the emergency that Ms B perceived was not confined to a fear of familicide on the part of Mr B. That said, if the nature of the emergency relied upon by Ms B for the proposed defences was so confined, then my ultimate conclusion would be the same.
	
	
	The Crown, at trial, acknowledged that the evidentiary threshold was a low one and accepted (for the purposes of the argument as to whether Ms B had satisfied the evidential burden necessary for the defence to go to the jury) that there was evidence capable of suggesting as a reasonable possibility that Ms B subjectively believed that: the child had been sexually abused by the father; there had not been, and would not be, a proper investigation into the alleged sexual abuse; the father had psychiatric problems and was suicidal or possibly homicidal; and that the child was “deteriorating” as a result of (the Family Court ordered) contact with the father (as noted in her Honour’s reasons at [59]).
	
	
	As to s 10.3(2)(a), her Honour was satisfied that the evidence was capable of supporting the reasonable possibility that, as at 24 April 2008, Ms B believed that circumstances of extraordinary emergency existed ([61]). Her Honour noted the submissions made by the Crown, first, to the effect that this was not a reasonable belief having regard to various matters (including that the contact sessions with Mr B were supervised) and, second, that the possibility that unsupervised contact might be ordered in the future was not capable of amounting to an extraordinary emergency. Nevertheless, her Honour did not find against Ms B on the discharge of the evidential burden so far as it related to the requirement posed by s 10.3(2)(a) of the Criminal Code ([72]).
	
	
	Where her Honour found that the evidential burden had not been discharged was in relation to the requirements in s 10.3(2)(b) and (c).
	
	
	Her Honour concluded that, in circumstances where Ms B had a right of appeal (i.e., from the supervised contact orders), the evidence was not capable of supporting the reasonable possibility that Ms B reasonably believed that committing the offence was the only reasonable way to deal with the emergency ([108]) nor that Ms B reasonably believed that the conduct was a reasonable response to the emergency ([109]-[110]).
	
	
	The Crown had pointed to other courses of action available to Ms B at the time to demonstrate that there was not a reasonable possibility that Ms B could reasonably have believed that taking her child out of the country was the only reasonable way to deal with the emergency. Those other course of action included: not cooperating with the contact centre; not taking the child to the contact centre; moving the child interstate; as well as taking the child to the police or the Joint Investigative Response Team (JIRT) or DOCS for the investigation of the alleged threats or raising the concerns with the contact centre. Her Honour did not accept that those were other reasonable ways to deal with the perceived emergency. In that regard, her Honour noted that non-compliance with the contact orders would have amounted to intentional contravention of the parenting order, potentially with the consequence that Ms B’s concerns of abuse would be ignored and the child placed permanently with the alleged abuser, and that Ms B had already reported her concerns to the police, JIRT and DOCS ([99]).
	
	
	As to the possibility of an appeal or an urgent application to the Court, at [107] her Honour said:
	


That an appeal may have been expensive did not mean that it was not a reasonably available course of action. Although it may not have been the accused’s preference to obtain a loan she was at that time still working and could have done so. Even if the accused was impecunious she could have taken the appeal herself. It is no answer to say she was not aware she could have done so because pursuit of her right of appeal would have led her to discover the necessary mechanism for such appeal and the steps associated with it, including the right to represent herself. That the accused had been advised that the appeal was unlikely to be unsuccessful did not mean that it was not a reasonably available alternative course of action. It was one that did not involve a breach of the law. That the accused might have been unaware of the opportunity of bringing an urgent application does not change the position. Upon giving instructions to lodge an appeal, the necessary steps could have been taken. As the Crown submitted, the relevant concept is of necessity, not expediency or strong preference.


	
	Her Honour thus concluded that the requirement under s 10.3(2)(b) was not satisfied.
	
	
	Her Honour approached the requirement under s 10.3(2)(c) on the basis that there needed to be some evidence capable of suggesting the possibility that Ms B reasonably believed that the conduct was a reasonable response to the emergency. Her Honour said that a response was not proportionate to the threat if there were reasonable grounds for believing that there were alternative courses of action available (referring to Bayley v Police [2007] SASC 411; (2007) 178 A Crim R 202) and noted that in this case, where there was a right of appeal, there was such a course of action available ([109]-[110]). Her Honour thus concluded that this requirement was also not satisfied in Ms B’s case.
	
	
	In these proceedings, Ms B submits that the other alternative courses of action postulated by the Crown, including the possibility of an appeal, would not have resulted in “a better investigation” because of the Family Court order appointing Dr Waters as the sole court expert to prepare a report (AT 13-20) and the fact that he, in preparation of the report, had not assessed her child. Ms B maintains that Dr Waters (a forensic child psychiatrist) is not an expert in child sexual abuse and should not have been appointed by the Family Court. She has made serious allegations about Dr Waters, accusing him of corruption, bias, misrepresentation and perjury.
	
	
	Ms B argues that to have made an application for a different expert would have required an affidavit and would only have resulted in the appointment of another Family Court psychologist (AT 13.29). She contends that the Family Court psychologists do not have the skill in assessing sexual abuse (and hence this would not have produced a better outcome). Ms B also says that any such application would have taken too long, and that she was not advised as to the ability to make an urgent application. Ms B said:
	


So, going interstate would not have helped, withholding him from the contact centre I knew I would just be in trouble, even more trouble, I would have to bring him back to contact or lose him, they would just take him out of my care. (AT 13.41-43).


	
	What is clear from Ms B’s submissions in this Court, and was apparent from her evidence at the trial, is that in taking her son out of the jurisdiction she was intentionally seeking to prevent or inhibit the enforcement of the supervised contact orders and to put herself and her son beyond reach of the Australian legal system. She maintains that this was the only way she could protect her child from what she believed was his ongoing deterioration as a result of the supervised contact sessions.
	
	
	Ms B made it very clear on this appeal that her reason for going overseas was the “behaviour” of the Family Court when the decision was made appointing Dr Waters as the expert and granting “excessive contact” to the father (AT 39.33).
	
	
	Ms B submits that the evidence did not support an assumption that the child was being continually supervised during contact sessions (see [90] and [91] of her appeal submissions) – a submission that seemingly goes to her belief as to the existence of the emergency, not as to whether (considered objectively or otherwise) her action was the only reasonable way to respond to the emergency nor that it was a reasonable response. Ms B also submits that unsupervised contact orders were almost inevitable following Dr Waters’ report and contends that her Honour did not adequately consider the risk to the child of the “impending unsupervised contact”.
	
	
	Ms B emphasised in her submissions that: in her opinion appealing provided her with no reasonable alternative course of action; her lawyers had advised her not to appeal; she did not know she could have represented herself in Court; she would not have been able to undertake an appeal herself or to know how to obtain a stay of the orders; and any appeal would have delayed proceedings beyond 5 June 2008 and would not have protected the child from unlawful attack outside of the contact centre (this last submission apparently referring to Ms B’s concern that the father might not simply have had suicidal intentions but might have decided to kill them all).
	
	
	Ms B accepts that her lawyer had told her she could seek a second opinion if she disagreed with the findings in Dr Waters’ report but says (submission [166]) that would not have helped protect her child especially given that if that had happened the expert would have been Dr Robinson, a psychiatrist whose name Ms B had initially put forward as an appropriate court expert but who is now the subject of not dissimilar allegations as those made by Ms B against Dr Waters. The basis for Ms B’s belief that Dr Robinson would have been appointed as the alternative expert in 2008 was not made clear but is presumably the fact that Ms B had nominated Dr Robinson as an acceptable expert at that time and the Family Court has since appointed her as an expert in Ms B’s case.
	
	
	Ms B maintains that the jury should have been left to decide “whether it would be reasonable that I ignore legal advice, attempt to run an appeal and compete against Dr Waters’ report when I knew nothing about the law”. That, however, elides the subjective and the objective elements of the respective tests – and, significantly, it does not take into account the different stage of the proceedings at which advice as to prospects of an appeal were given.
	
	
	As noted above, Ms B relied on events following the recovery of the child as demonstrating the objective reasonableness of her concerns. In particular, she said that independent reports had demonstrated that the child had severely deteriorated in the father’s care, was suicidal and had been admitted to a special school (submissions on sentence at [29]-[52]). Ms B also made reference to the fact that, after her return to Australia, she was only able to obtain a Family Court listing five months after she made an application for an urgent hearing.
	
	
	For completeness, I should note that one of Ms B’s complaints in these proceedings is the “failure” of the primary judge to admit into evidence a copy of a letter dated 5 March 2008 in which Ms B’s lawyers gave advice as to the prospects of appeal from the orders of the Family Court (see amended written submissions at [42]). That complaint cannot be sustained having regard to a review of the transcript as to what occurred in relation to that document in the absence of the jury. That may be summarised as follows.
	
	
	Ms B (who gave evidence in part by reading out paragraphs from her February 2008 Family Court affidavit) referred to the letter and informed the trial judge that she wanted to make the point that she had tried to appeal the orders. She was told that she did not need to tender the letter (which was then marked MFI 52). Tender of the document would, of course, have been likely to amount to a waiver of privilege in relation to the advice and matters connected with it, which was presumably part of her Honour’s concern when she informed Ms B that she did not need to tender it.
	
	
	Ms B then said that she would not tender the letter “simply because I am going to have to explain issues I had with advice from my lawyers [and] that’s not central to my leaving the country”. Following further discussion, in which her Honour explained that tendering the letter would give the Crown the right to cross-examine Ms B on it, the matter was left that the Crown did not object to Ms B having the opportunity to reflect on the question overnight.
	
	
	Ms B did not address the question of the tender of that document again. Had she wished to do so, it was open to her to tender the document. On other occasions in the trial it was clear that Ms B was keeping track of outstanding tender documents. There is no suggestion that she had simply omitted to tender this document. In any event, there was other evidence before the jury which made it clear that Ms B had obtained advice as to the prospects of an appeal - in an email from Ms B to her lawyers on 7 March 2008 she said, among other things, that: she could not afford to appeal the order for supervised time; she had already taken and accepted the advice of a barrister that it would be unlikely that an appeal would be successful; and therefore she would not appeal; and also made reference to a “stay” of the orders, saying that she did not understand that terminology and therefore could not comment on that. The inference to be drawn from the reference to a stay is that Musgrave Peach had given some advice or made some reference, following the making of the supervised contact orders, not only to Ms B’s ability to appeal from those orders but also to the possibility of a stay of the orders. It was not suggested that Ms B could not have pressed for clarification of this from Musgrave Peach or any of the other sources from which it seems Ms B was obtaining advice at the time.
	
	
	The essence of Ms B’s submission on ground 1, as was her argument at trial, is thus her conduct was not voluntary in that she was forced to choose between two conflicting laws, the “law against unlawful harm” and the family contact orders (and she prioritised the protection of her son). Ms B argued that implementing an appeal would have required extensive preparation including a stay of orders and an application for an extension of time and in the meantime she would have breached her duty to protect her child from unlawful harm ([22] of her written submissions).
	
	
	For ground 1 to succeed in relation to the sudden or extraordinary emergency defence, it is necessary to conclude that her Honour erred in finding that the evidence was not capable of suggesting, as a reasonable possibility, not only that Ms B subjectively believed that there was an emergency and that taking her child out of the country was the only reasonable response to the emergency (and was a reasonable response thereto), but also that such a belief was objectively reasonable.
	
	
	On Ms B’s evidence, as at the time she bought the airline tickets she had only briefly read Dr Waters’ report (which had been sent by Dr Waters to the Family Court on 3 April 2008 but was not received by her until about 23 April 2008), and she had not obtained legal advice in relation to that report, but she nevertheless believed that it was imminent that unsupervised access would be permitted. The material before the Court was not capable of suggesting the reasonable possibility that there was an objectively reasonable basis for that belief.
	
	
	The evidence was capable of suggesting as a reasonable possibility that Ms B believed that her child’s behaviour was deteriorating following the commencement of the contact visits (as her Honour in effect found). That may have been the case whether or not Ms B’s concerns as to the continuation of abuse during the contact sessions had any valid foundation. Dr Waters, for example, considered that the deterioration could be expected having regard to the frequency of the contact visits. However, that does not lead to the conclusion that the evidence was capable of supporting the reasonable possibility, objectively speaking, that the only reasonable response to deal with that situation was to remove the child from the jurisdiction.
	
	
	Similarly, though the evidence was certainly capable of supporting a conclusion that the investigation that had been carried out as at 24 April 2008 had not been sufficient to determine the truth or otherwise of the sexual abuse allegations (as Dr Waters himself seems to have conceded when, in cross-examination by Ms B, he indicated that his was only a conditional report and that there was “latitude for doubt” as to some of the areas of concern that had been raised by Ms B), the evidence was not reasonably capable of supporting the reasonable possibility of it being objectively reasonable to conclude, as at 24 April 2008, that there would be no proper investigation in the future of the abuse allegations.
	
	
	Ms B’s conclusion in that regard seems to have been based heavily on what she had read in various literature on child sexual abuse and, in particular, a doctoral thesis written by a Ms Foote. Ms B had not, at that stage, seen the video recording of an interview with her son which had been conducted by JIRT on 10 December 2007. While she had been told that an investigation by the JIRT and the police Child Protection Unit (CPU) was closed, there was no suggestion that it could not be re-opened if circumstances warranted it. The impact of the contact sessions on her son had yet to be properly considered by any expert or the Court. Further, Professor Briggs (an emeritus professor at the University of Adelaide with extensive experience in the area of child protection, with whom Ms B had initiated an email exchange seeking advice before she left the country) had not seen Ms B’s child and, in commenting on the situation, was solely relying on the information and instructions given to her by Ms B. Insofar as Ms B calls in aid the conclusion drawn by Professor Briggs, after the event, that the JIRT interview was woefully inadequate, there was no suggestion by Professor Briggs that a proper investigation could not or would not have been carried out had Dr Waters’ report been tested or had an application of that kind been made in April 2008.
	
	
	While Ms B says she was unaware of the legal avenues available to her, and that it was not reasonable to expect her to “second guess” her lawyers, the fact is that she simply did not seek, nor did she wait for, any advice as to what might be able to be done following receipt of Dr Waters’ report. Her conclusion was that, whatever it said, it would not assist her.
	
	
	There is provision under the Family Law Act and Family Law Rules 2004 (Cth) pursuant to which Ms B could have sought an extension of time for an appeal from the supervised contact orders and also for her to have sought a variation of the contact orders.
	
	
	Dr Waters’ report, had Ms B read it carefully at the time, did not support a change to the contact orders to permit unsupervised access. Rather, what Dr Waters recommended was the very same reduction in the number of supervised contact visits that Ms B, through her solicitors, had requested. Ms B’s own lawyers had advised her not to read anything into the letter from Mr B’s lawyers (seeking consent to unsupervised access in light of the contents of the report and suggesting that the sexual abuse allegations were by then “dead in the water”) until they were able to give her advice.
	
	
	Ms B’s legal advice up to the time that she left the country does not support the conclusion that taking the child out of the country was the only reasonable, or even a reasonable, response to concerns as to the deterioration in her son’s behaviour while contact visits continued. The advice obtained in early March 2008 from her then solicitors (Musgrave Peach), and then from one or more barristers as to the prospects of an appeal from the orders of the Family Court, can only have been as to the prospects of an appeal at that stage (when no contact visits, and hence no deterioration in the son’s behaviour, had commenced). The advice Ms B says she obtained in or about 10 April 2008 was that a change to the contact orders was unlikely until the Court had received Dr Waters’ report. That is not surprising since by that time a report must have been imminent (indeed, unbeknownst to Ms B, the report had in fact already been provided to the Court). Ms B also says that her new lawyers had advised her that an appeal was unlikely to succeed. Any such advice again cannot have been given with the benefit of reading and absorbing the import of Dr Waters’ report.
	
	
	The possibility of seeking changes to contact orders in advance of a final hearing must have been apparent to Ms B when her lawyers acted upon her instructions to request such a change. Ms B had the benefit of legal representation and could have asked for advice as to what, if anything, could be done in light of Dr Waters’ report.
	
	
	The position, therefore, is that as at 24 April 2008, when Ms B left the country, she was aware that the report had been received. She chose to leave the country without waiting for advice as to the import of the report and, insofar as she believed unsupervised contact was imminent as a result of that report, without fully comprehending the recommendations in fact made in the report. Her position was, in effect, that whatever the report said it would not have satisfied her because of her belief (without having seen or having been present during the JIRT interview) that the JIRT interview was not adequate and that Dr Waters, of whom she had already formed the view that he was biased (based on an article of his that had been published on the internet), was “dismissive” of the sexual abuse allegations.
	
	
	Although her Honour does not appear to have relied on this in reaching her conclusion on the availability of the sudden or extraordinary emergency defence, in addition to having a right to appeal to a full court from the February 2008 orders of the Family Court judge there was capacity to bring an urgent application before a judge of the Court on the basis of a change in circumstances. Ms B’s lawyers would have been aware of this. She says that they did not advise her of this (although they apparently did speak of a stay) but the evidence shows that Ms B did not give them an opportunity to provide any such advice after Dr Waters’ report was received.
	
	
	Insofar as Ms B, at trial, referred to a concern as to possible homicidal tendencies on Ms B’s part, there was simply no evidence of an imminent threat of physical harm to Ms B or to her child. It was not suggested that any actual threat had been made by Mr B. Rather, Ms B seems to have taken from the statistics she had read on familicide, coupled with her perception of Mr B’s mental state, that this was a real risk at that time.
	
	
	The belief that Ms B expressed to Professor Briggs as to the inadequacy of the justice system in Australia, at a time (around June 2009) when she had attended only one court appearance (on 29 February 2008), seems to have been based in large part on the materials that she had read and the conclusions she had formed as to what was likely to happen in the Family Court proceedings. That and the other views expressed by Ms B in her statement sent to Professor Briggs in 2009 (set out in the appendix to these reasons) cannot be accepted as objectively reasonable having regard to the material before this Court as to the manner in which the proceedings in the Family Court were conducted up to the time that Ms B intentionally removed her child from the jurisdiction.
	
	
	Deterioration in her son’s behaviour following contact visits was a matter that could reasonably have been dealt with by an application to the Family Court. The matter was already listed for 5 June 2008 and the very fact that a request had been made for consent to a variation of orders made clear that variation of orders was a possibility. There was no objective basis for the view that Dr Waters’ report made it likely that unsupervised contact would be imminent. Rather, he had recommended a reduction in the supervised contact visits (though expressing a view as to Mr B’s parenting capacity and found it difficult to conclude there had been sexual abuse). Armed with Dr Waters’ report, one would have thought a reduction in supervised contact visits was the more likely result had the matter been brought back before the Court. Delay in listing matters some years later is not indicative of what the position might have been had Ms B not taken matters into her own hands in 2008.
	
	
	As to Ms B’s concern that there would be no proper investigation of the allegations, it had been made clear to her that the case could be reopened by the JIRT if there were further evidence, such as (one would assume) evidence of deteriorating behaviour.
	
	
	Material relied upon after the event is not relevant to the formation of a belief on her part at the time. With hindsight it might make more obvious the reasonableness of the belief at the time but matters such as delays in Family Court proceedings or deterioration in the child’s behaviour on his return cannot be assessed without also taking into account the effect of the disruption and subsequent relocation to Australia, and separation from his mother.
	
	
	In my opinion, her Honour did not err in concluding that the evidence did not meet the evidential burden (slender as it is) of suggesting that there was a reasonable possibility that the necessary belief by Ms B (that the only reasonable alternative was to remove her child from the country and that this was a reasonable response to the emergency) was an objectively reasonable belief. To reach a contrary conclusion would require it to be accepted that it was objectively reasonable to believe, in effect, that the Family Court and its court appointed experts would not properly consider the material put forward in such a case or would be incapable of so doing, and that neither the appellant’s own legal representatives nor the independent children’s lawyer would act with a view to the best interests of the child, taking into consideration not only Dr Waters’ report but also any evidence of continuing harm at contact centre visits.
	


Self defence


	
	A similar conclusion must be reached in relation to the defence sought to be maintained under s 10.4 of the Criminal Code (of self-defence).
	
	
	Her Honour was satisfied that the evidence relied upon by Ms B was capable of suggesting the reasonable possibility that she believed her conduct in taking the child from Australia to a place outside Australia was necessary in order to defend the child from harm ([121]).
	
	
	As to the requirement that the conduct be a reasonable response in the circumstances as perceived by Ms B at the time, her Honour noted that this was to be determined by an entirely objective assessment of the proportionality of Ms B’s response to the situation Ms B subjectively believed she faced (R v Katarzynski [2002] NSWSC 613 at [22]-[23]). Her Honour also noted that, in determining whether there was evidence capable of suggesting the reasonable possibility that the conduct was a reasonable response in the circumstances as Ms B perceived them, the availability of other possible responses was a material consideration [129].
	
	
	Her Honour concluded (at [130] and [132]):
	


130.   In circumstances where, as here, the accused had available to her a right of appeal against the interim order, which she chose not to exercise, as well as a right to be heard at any hearing of the application for parenting orders, together with a right of appeal from any such order, the extreme action of taking the child from Australia to a place overseas cannot be objectively viewed as anything other than a fundamentally unreasonable and disproportionate response to the circumstances as the accused perceived them to be.

…

132.   In circumstances where … the conduct is a fundamentally unreasonable and disproportionate response to the circumstances as the accused perceived them to be the evidence is not capable of raising and does not in fact suggest the reasonable possibility that the accused’s conduct was a reasonable response in the circumstances as she perceived them.


	
	Her Honour thus concluded that Ms B had failed to discharge the evidential burden for the defence under s 10.4 of the Criminal Code to be left to the jury because the evidence relied upon was not capable in her Honour’s opinion of suggesting the reasonable possibility that the conduct in taking the child outside Australia was a reasonable response in the circumstances as Ms B perceived them ([138]).
	
	
	Her Honour took into account the circumstances as Ms B perceived them at the time (with one error that is not material – namely her Honour’s reference to advice that Ms B had received that she might lose her child if she appealed, whereas the advice she did receive was that she might lose her child if she did not comply with contact orders). Her Honour correctly concluded that taking the step of removing the child from the jurisdiction was not a reasonable response to those circumstances. The fact that the child’s distress was reduced when living overseas (according to the material to which Ms B referred) does not alter the fact that this was, as her Honour suggested, an extreme response in the sense of being disproportionate to the circumstances facing Ms B.
	


Conclusion on ground 1


	
	The Crown submits, and I agree, that for her Honour to have ruled that the two defences could properly have been left to the jury would have encouraged or permitted the jury impermissibly to exercise a power to dispense with compliance with the law. In R v Rogers (1996) 86 A Crim R 542, Gleeson CJ considered the public policy considerations that had informed the limitations imposed on the availability of the defence of necessity, as follows:
	


The corollary of the notion that the defence of necessity exists to meet cases where the circumstances overwhelmingly impel disobedience to the law is that the law cannot leave people free to choose for themselves which laws they will obey, or to construct and apply their own set of values inconsistent with those implicit in the law. Nor can the law encourage juries to exercise a power to dispense with compliance with the law where they consider disobedience to be reasonable, on the ground that the conduct of an accused person serves some value higher than that implicit in the law which is disobeyed (at 546). (my emphasis)


	
	Her Honour was clearly conscious of the need not to usurp the jury’s function in determining the issue of reasonableness. She noted the necessity for a trial judge to remain mindful of the onus of proof and had in mind the reluctance of a trial judge to withdraw from a jury any issue that should properly be left for them. Her Honour was well aware that it was a grave responsibility to take defences away from the jury [131] and carefully considered the evidence before her in that context.
	
	
	There was no error on her Honour’s part in concluding that the availability of the appeal process (and, I would add, of the ability to make an application for a variation or stay of the contact orders on a change in the behaviour of the child) meant that there was no reasonable possibility that the evidence could suggest that Ms B had an objectively reasonable belief as to the second and third requirements of s 10.3 or that the response was a reasonable one for the purposes of s 10.4.
	
	
	Thus, in my opinion, her Honour did not err in reaching the conclusion that the evidential burden was not satisfied. The only objectively reasonable conclusion on the evidence that was before her Honour was that Ms B chose, knowing that she was acting in disobedience to the Family Court contact orders and intending to put herself and her son out of the reach of the Court’s control, to take the law into her own hands. The evidence before her Honour was not capable of supporting as a reasonable possibility that a belief by Ms B that this was the only reasonable response to the emergency (and that it was a reasonable response) was objectively reasonable; nor could it support as a reasonable possibility the conclusion that this was an objectively reasonable response to the circumstances as she perceived them.
	
	
	Ground 1 is not made out.
	


Ground 2 – ruling re irrelevance of fact of sexual abuse


	
	The second ground raised on the conviction appeal was expressed in the notice of appeal as follows:
	


2.   Her Honour erred in ruling that the question of whether [Mr B] sexually abused [the child] was not relevant and therefore not to be considered in this trial. Her Honour erred in directing the jury not to consider whether [Mr B] did sexually abuse [the child] and in directing me not to adduce evidence for that purpose.


	
	On any view of the matter, the question whether the child had in fact been sexually abused was not relevant to the issue whether there had been a breach of s 65Y of the Family Law Act, save insofar as it was relevant to the defences that Ms B sought to raise. As to those defences, once her Honour had accepted that there was evidence capable of suggesting as a reasonable possibility that Ms B subjectively held the relevant belief to satisfy the sudden or extraordinary emergency defence or that there were circumstances that would potentially enliven the defence of self-defence, the fact that the sexual abuse allegations may have been true did not take those matters any further. (Of course, if the belief as to sexual abuse was manifestly erroneous, this might affect the objective reasonableness of her belief as to sudden or extraordinary emergency or as to the circumstances giving rise to a defence of self-defence but that was not her Honour’s conclusion.)
	
	
	Ms B maintains, however, that evidence of the alleged sexual abuse supported the objective component of her defences, i.e., that her belief as to the matters in s 10.3 was objectively reasonable and that she was responding to unlawful conduct for the purposes of precluding the exclusion arising under s 10.4 (submissions [84] and [85]). It is submitted that the evidence that her husband was sexually abusive supported her credibility and was “tendency” evidence that it was objectively reasonable for her to fear sexual abuse/unlawful harm both at the contact centre and with unsupervised contact in the near future (submissions [81]-[119]). (It does not appear that Ms B is here referring to tendency evidence in the sense that such evidence is dealt with in the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth). Certainly, no notice of an intention to adduce tendency evidence appears to have been filed.)
	
	
	In her oral submissions on the appeal, Ms B expressed concern that without the evidence she wished to adduce in relation to the sexual abuse (such as the evidence from Professor Briggs) her Honour may not have understood just how serious was the deterioration in the behaviour of her child once the contact visits had commenced (AT15.15). Such a criticism cannot be sustained in the face of her Honour’s comprehensive summary of the sexual abuse allegations in Annexure A to her Honour’s reasons for judgment. Moreover, as already noted, her Honour found in effect that there was evidence capable of supporting the reasonable possibility of a conclusion that Ms B held an objectively reasonable belief that sexual abuse had occurred and that the son’s behaviour was deteriorating as a result of the contact visits. A finding that there had in fact been sexual abuse or that this was ongoing (even had this been appropriate in the context of the proceedings against Ms B) would not have assisted Ms B to meet the evidential burden on the second and third requirements of s 10.3, nor to enable her to raise the ground of self-defence before the jury (since, again, that turned on whether the conduct was reasonably proportionate to the circumstances as Ms B perceived them).
	
	
	The Crown submits that once her Honour ruled that neither of the defences was available to be left to the jury evidence concerning the alleged sexual abuse of the child was no longer of relevance to any issue in the trial.
	
	
	Ms B complains, in her written submissions in response to the Crown’s submissions, that evidence supportive of the sexual abuse allegations was excluded at a time prior to all of the evidence and that her Honour could not have known what might have emerged in cross-examination of the witnesses (referring by way of example to concessions made in her cross-examination of Dr Robinson). However, the evidence that Ms B sought to adduce as to liability was outlined to her Honour before her Honour ruled against the admissibility of the particular documents and lines of questioning of which Ms B complains.
	
	
	Insofar as ground 2 rests on the Court’s determination of ground 1, it must logically fail since ground 1 has not been made out. However, in oral argument, Ms B maintained that ground 2 was independent of ground 1 and was in essence a complaint that her Honour had wrongly rejected evidence supporting the conclusion that Mr B had sexually abused the child.
	
	
	Directions were made for Ms B to identify precisely the evidence that she said was the subject of this ground of appeal, i.e., the evidence which she said her Honour had wrongly excluded, and to provide copies of the material comprising that evidence. In response to those directions Ms B filed the November 2014 affidavit and annexures to which I have already referred and a subsequent 16 page set of submissions in February this year.
	
	
	The November 2014 affidavit, in summary, recounts the history of the matter, from Ms B’s perspective, and the material from which Ms B has formed the belief that the sexual abuse occurred. It contains a mixture of evidence and submissions. Broadly, the ground that it covers includes: the basis on which Ms B has drawn the conclusion that her child was sexually abused by his father; the reason she believed she had no option but to take the child out of the country; her criticisms of the investigation of her allegations of child sexual abuse and of the Family Court proceedings; her commentary on or response to some of the evidence before the Family Court and at her trial; her child’s experience while overseas; and her concerns in relation to her child’s development since his return.
	
	
	In that affidavit, Ms B recounts her recollection of the history of her child’s development, his early anxiety with other children and attachment to her, the circumstances in which Mr B had interaction and (on her business trips) sole care of the child, the disclosures made by the child and the course of events following her report of those disclosures to the authorities. Ms B refers to material relating to Mr B’s mental state and to research carried out by her (some before her departure from Australia and some after she had left) as to child sexual abuse and the way in which investigation thereof should, according to various academics in the field, be carried out.
	
	
	Some of that material was in fact admitted in evidence at the trial (and hence there is no basis for it to be said that it was wrongly excluded); some of that material was not sought to be tendered at the trial (and hence again cannot be said to have been wrongly excluded); some was not prepared until after the trial, as is apparent from the descriptions of that material in Ms B’s November 2014 affidavit and conceded by her, and hence could not have been admitted at trial.
	
	
	What this Court had understood Ms B was seeking to raise by her wrongful exclusion of evidence complaint was a contention that she had sought to adduce particular evidence and that her Honour had wrongly excluded that evidence. What has become apparent from the written submissions filed in February 2015 in response to the Crown’s further written submissions (those in turn responding to Ms B’s November affidavit), is that Ms B has understood the leave granted to her for the filing of submissions as to the wrongful exclusion of evidence at the trial as being an invitation to set out the whole of the evidence on which she says she would have relied had she been permitted to put before the jury the issue as to whether or not Mr B had in fact sexually abused her son. An argument of that kind must fail given the conclusion that her Honour did not err in ruling that the question whether Mr B had sexually abused the child was not relevant to be considered in her trial.
	
	
	Ms B’s 2015 February submissions, in effect, re-state her argument that in 2008 she was faced with conflicting legal duties; re-state her submissions as to the alleged sexual abuse and seek to explain why it is that she did not adduce certain of the material she has now put forward and on which she now relies.
	
	
	Ms B has produced a 14 page annexure responding to the Crown’s analysis of the evidentiary status of material in her November affidavit.
	
	
	In a number of instances, Ms B concedes in that annexure that evidence referred to in her November affidavit was not admitted into the trial (such as her 28 February 2008 affidavit) or was not sought to be tendered and explains that this was due to her inexperience in criminal trials (see the explanation in paragraph 2(b)). In other cases in response to the Crown’s submissions, Ms B responds (as in paragraph 2(a) of her annexure) by stating that the evidence she tendered during the trial was not for the purposes of establishing that sexual abuse had in fact occurred and that the material in her November 2014 affidavit is now presented as the whole of the evidence she seeks to rely upon for the purpose of establishing that sexual abuse did in fact occur.
	
	
	At [2] of her February 2015 submissions, Ms B states: “I required the jury to make a finding on whether [Mr B] sexually abused [her son] because it is what actually happened and because this finding is the objective evidence of the reasonableness of my conduct in response, in addition to findings on risk of attack by [Mr B] – at any time and in any place” (my emphasis). That, however, is not the basis on which Ms B conducted her defence and such a course was expressly disallowed by her at the time.
	
	
	On 15 October 2013, before the jury was empanelled, in the context of her objection to the admissibility of Dr Waters’ report, Ms B stated that she did not want to have the jury try to ascertain the sexual abuse issue. She explained that this was because it was very complex and the fact that the abuse happened was not the reason that she left the country; and because to do so there would need to be an expert with child sexual abuse expertise (T 63.25).
	
	
	On 24 October 2013 (day 9 of the trial), in the course of argument about what evidence could be given by Professor Briggs, Ms B disclaimed any intention to use Professor Briggs as an expert in this case, stating that she wanted to use Professor Briggs’ expertise in general (T 344.32).
	
	
	On 30 October 2013 (day 13 of the trial) (T 47ff), referring to the “purple lipstick recording”, Ms B said “I want to use it not as evidence of the facts asserted but as evidence of the fact that my son spoke to me in a manner consistent with disclosing sexual abuse”.
	
	
	Ms B said:
	


I am using this recording as evidence of the fact that my son spoke to me in a manner that I found concerning and it is objective evidence that that’s what he was doing. I am not using it to prove sexual abuse or anything else.


	
	Ms B argued that the purple lipstick recording showed her credibility in circumstances where she had been accused of fabricating allegations. She confirmed again that:
	


I’m not using [the purple lipstick recording to say it] … actually happened. I am using it to say my son was speaking to me. That’s, in fact, why I took the recording.


	
	Similarly, in relation to the JIRT interview, Ms B indicated that she wanted to tender it in order to point to a discrepancy in the transcript (namely, that her son had answered the question as to his name correctly at first, by responding with his Christian name, then incorrectly answered the question as to his other name); to counter Dr Waters’ comment that her son was unsettled at the interview and to point to “concerning signs” in the video that she submitted would lead one to think that perhaps there should be more than one interview. Ms B had not seen the recording of the JIRT interview or the transcript at the time she left the country (and therefore it could not have informed her state of mind at that time) but maintained that she knew it had been unsuccessful.
	
	
	In the context of her oral application for a ruling on whether Dr Waters was an expert in sexual abuse, Ms B said:
	


I am not going to try and prove that he [her son] was sexually abused but I do want to prove that [Dr] Waters’… opinion was worthless … because he didn’t rely on any appropriate evidence and because he didn’t have expertise.


	
	In those circumstances, it is not open to Ms B now to contend that her Honour erred in not admitting evidence going to the truth of the sexual abuse allegations. The fact that, as Ms B states in her most recent submissions, she may now have formed the view that certain matters were wrong – such as her statement that Professor Briggs was not an expert in the case (which Ms B now submits was an incorrect view) that initial incorrect view being said to be “as a result of bias in the way the Family Court appoints experts”); or that she did not seek during much of the trial to have the jury make findings of fact on whether sexual abuse had actually occurred because she accepted the Crown’s assertions and the trial judge’s ruling that the evidence was irrelevant; or that she wrongly believed she could not seek to ask the jury to find that sexual abuse had occurred and wrongly believed that she could not ask Professor Briggs her opinion on that issue, does not reveal error in the trial judge’s rulings on the admissibility of evidence relating to the truth of the sexual abuse allegations. Ms B is bound by the forensic decisions made by her in the trial, whether those were affected by her inexperience or otherwise.
	
	
	Ms B complains that she was not advised that she could argue otherwise against the proposition that the jury should not be embarking on an enquiry as to whether or not her child was abused. However, it was not for the trial judge or the Crown to advise Ms B what argument she should advance in the conduct of her defence.
	
	
	The two rulings that were identified by Ms B in oral submissions as incorrect rulings referable to particular evidence or a particular area of cross-examination, and which would fall within the scope of the re-cast ground 2, were a ruling on 25 October 2013 and 14 November 2013 each being in response to an application by Ms B to adduce particular evidence from Professor Briggs, the psychologist with experience in dealing with child sexual assault matters from whom Ms B had obtained advice in March 2008. Her Honour gave short reasons in relation to each application. It is clear from the transcript that there were a number of other areas in which Ms B was permitted to adduce evidence from Professor Briggs.
	


25 October 2013 ruling


	
	The context in which this arose was that the Crown had objected to Ms B asking Professor Briggs a number of questions on the basis that they were either irrelevant or that Professor Briggs lacked the necessary expertise to give evidence on those matters.
	
	
	Ms B was asked, in the absence of the jury, to identify the matters she wished to ask Professor Briggs. Those included: communications Ms B had had with Professor Briggs in the period of time leading up to her departure from Australia going to matters such as the giving of gifts at contact centres; the reasons given by Dr Waters for not interviewing the child in March 2007; delay by children in disclosing abuse; questions as to the investigation that had been carried out; what a thorough investigation would involve; and questions about child sex offenders and their behaviours in grooming children, connected to the circumstance that a child might show a positive friendly emotion to someone who has in fact abused them.
	
	
	Her Honour accepted that evidence as to those matters might be relevant to the question of the circumstances at the time and as to what was perceived by Ms B, going to the reasonableness of any belief that she may have held at the time. Her Honour indicated that she would allow questions of Professor Briggs to be asked for that purpose. Her Honour considered that Professor Briggs was appropriately qualified to give evidence as to matters such as the age at which young children can be interviewed and as to the investigation of child sexual abuse allegations.
	
	
	The two areas on which her Honour did not allow cross-examination of Professor Briggs were, first, questions relating to the statement by Dr Waters in his 10 April 2008 report to the effect that Ms B did not disclose anything that could constitute a penetrative act (about which Ms B cross-examined Dr Waters and which Dr Waters effectively conceded was incorrect) and, second, Professor Briggs’ comments on the JIRT video.
	
	
	As to the first, her Honour considered that the question was aimed at Professor Briggs being asked to give a medical opinion, namely what it is that might be discovered after a penetrative act. Her Honour would not permit the witness to give any such medical opinion. Ms B in her February 2015 written submissions maintains that the opinion that she was seeking from Professor Briggs (in her question regarding evidence of anal penetration) did not concern physical evidence of the abuse but was a question asking Professor Briggs to comment on her son’s behaviour and disclosures as evidence that he was communicating and behaving consistently with a child who had been anally penetrated. However, the question as put on the voir dire by Ms B was as to whether it was possible that her son could have experienced a penetrative event (T9.34, 15/10/13).
	
	
	Given that Professor Briggs was not called as a medical expert to give an opinion as to what kind of physical evidence there might have been or might potentially have been of penetrative abuse, there was no error by her Honour in rejecting a line of questioning that went to that issue. As to the line of questioning Ms B now says she intended (by reference to the behaviour that might be exhibited by a child who had suffered anal penetration), that was not obvious from the question she had put but in any event Ms B adduced evidence from Dr Waters in cross-examination to the effect that her son’s complaint as to his bottom being sore and her son asking his mother to clean inside his bottom could disclose penetrative abuse.
	
	
	As to the second area identified by Ms B, her Honour said that:
	


That exercise would appear to be irrelevant to the proceedings in that it must be borne in mind that these proceedings are not concerned with the review of whether or not the child was in fact sexually assaulted, and her opinion as to what may or may not be derived from the video is not relevant to the proceedings.


	
	Again, there was no error in the rejection of questioning along this line, bearing in mind that her Honour did permit evidence to be given as to what a thorough investigation might involve and her Honour did not preclude submissions by Ms B as to what might be discerned from the video.
	
	
	As to Ms B’s criticism of the JIRT interview, in her reasons on sentence her Honour concluded (at [32]) that it would be open to a tribunal of fact to conclude from that evidence that the procedure of having a one-off interview between a three year old child and a person the child had never met before was inadequate in the circumstances of the case. Having viewed the JIRT video in the course of preparing these reasons, I can only agree. Her Honour considered that this was supported by the evidence given in cross-examination by Dr Waters. Professor Briggs herself seemed to indicate that more than a one-off interview would be necessary.
	


14 November 2013


	
	On 14 November 2013, Ms B sought to adduce the evidence of Professor Briggs on the reasonableness of the conclusions Ms B drew from what the child had said, as well as the circumstances in which the further disclosures (after he had been taken out of the country) were made. Her Honour said:
	


I am not going to admit this evidence of Professor Briggs on this issue. The relevance of this is as originally flagged, as the jury can be directed, is that it shows the child was making disclosures of the type that the accused said he was making. Although Mr Crown cross-examined the accused on the reasonableness of the conclusion she drew from what was said, as well as the circumstances in which the further disclosure was made, it is clear from MFI 83 that this portion of Professor Briggs’ evidence goes to the likelihood of the disclosures being true, and that is a question that is not appropriate for the jury to be diverted into consideration of. So the Court proposes not to admit the evidence before the jury.


	
	A copy of MFI 83 was handed up on the hearing of the appeal. It consists of an email exchange between Professor Briggs and Ms B on 9 November 2013 in which Professor Briggs comments on and attributes possible meanings to what appears in a transcript of a recording between mother and child (the purple lipstick recording). Professor Briggs gives her interpretation of what was being disclosed to Ms B in that conversation.
	
	
	Ms B maintains (AT 18.20) that Professor Briggs’ assessment of the recorded disclosure was that she determined it was “authentic and supportive of finding sexual abuse”, though Ms B accepts that, on its face, the recording would not prove beyond reasonable doubt that the offence had occurred.
	
	
	In light of Ms B’s concessions referred to at [105] and [106] above, her Honour’s ruling on this area of cross-examination cannot be seen as being in error.
	
	
	For completeness, I note that annexed to Ms B’s November affidavit (Annexure Q) is a copy of what was MFI 82 at the trial. This was another email exchange between Professor Briggs and Ms B on 9 November 2013, in which Professor Briggs gave her opinion as to the techniques for interviewing young children in relation to sexual abuse allegations and concluded that the interview (by the JIRT) was “woefully inadequate” (Professor Briggs went on to express the opinion that if further information was disclosed there should have been another assessment on the child’s return to Australia and before he was in the care of the father, an opinion not relevant to the issues in the trial on any view of the matter).
	
	
	It is not clear whether Ms B complains about the rejection of MFI 82. If she does then that complaint is also unfounded. When Ms B left the country she had not seen the video of the JIRT interview and hence a conclusion that it would be objectively reasonable from that video to consider that the investigation was “woefully inadequate” could not be relevant to whether on the material then known to Ms B such an opinion would have been objectively reasonable.
	
	
	Insofar as Ms B now relies on Plomp v The Queen [1963] HCA 44; (1963) 110 CLR 234 to support the adducing of evidence of sexual abuse as contained in her November 2014 affidavit, it should be noted that the leave granted to file submissions identifying what evidence it was said had been wrongly excluded at the trial was not an invitation now to mount a case based on assertions that Mr B had in fact sexually abused her child that have not been tested and to which neither the Crown nor Mr B has had the opportunity in the trial proceedings to respond.
	
	
	Ground 2 is not made out.
	


Ground 3 – admissibility of Dr Waters’ report


	
	The last ground on which the conviction appeal is brought is that:
	


Her Honour erred in failing to make findings on the admissibility of Dr Waters [sic] report and specifically its impact on any future Court proceeding and therefore my ability to succeed at an appeal or any application for parenting orders.


	
	A copy of Dr Waters’ report was not in evidence at the trial. However, Ms B read out various portions of the report when cross-examining Dr Waters on the conclusions and recommendations contained in his report. Hence some of the content of the report became known at the trial. Ms B accepted on the hearing of the appeal that the Court could infer, from correspondence following the publication of that report, that Dr Waters’ report was not favourable to her position. She later annexed a copy of the report to her November affidavit.
	
	
	There is a certain irony in the contention by Ms B that her Honour erred in failing to make findings on the admissibility of Dr Waters’ report. It was in fact Ms B who had objected to the admission of that report in evidence. The Crown had indicated that it was proposing to use the report to refute the potential defences because the report suggested that the sexual abuse probably did not occur and that the mother had developed an “overvalued idea”. Ms B had objected that it was an untested report. Ms B says on this appeal that her objection was that it was wrongly defamatory of her (AT 19.45).
	
	
	Prior to the examination of Dr Waters, there was a discussion between the bench and the Crown, in the absence of the jury, as to the objections Ms B had raised to various portions of Dr Waters’ report. After some discussion, the Crown indicated that it proposed not to tender the report but just to have some parts of it, including parts already read out, lead orally. Those parts were described as the introductory part, for the fact that Dr Waters had conducted the interviews and had received certain documents and then the conclusions and recommendations expressed by him. Dr Waters had formed the view that both parents had parenting capacity, albeit the mother probably to a somewhat greater extent.
	
	
	Ms B then said that she was preparing to cross-examine Dr Waters and had changed her view (as to the admissibility of the report) because she thought it more helpful to her case to raise in cross-examination quite a bit of his report to establish how he formed his opinions.
	
	
	Her Honour quite properly pointed out to Ms B the need to be aware that cross-examination on certain matters might have the consequence that the Crown prosecutor might raise other things in the report or tender it. Ms B responded that she thought she had no alternative than to address the report because enough of it had gone in.
	
	
	Ms B cross-examined Dr Waters on his evidence and other portions of the report. She accepts that she tried to cross-examine him fully on the report (AT 19.50) and, in particular, she accepts that she cross-examined him on his conclusions and recommendations and was satisfied that those were the material portions of the report to go to the jury (AT 20.3; 11).
	
	
	Ms B sought a ruling from her Honour as to whether Dr Waters was an expert in sexual abuse. Her Honour declined to make such a ruling on the basis that there was no utility in so doing. Her Honour made clear that there was no need to rule on the admissibility of Dr Waters’ opinion because he had not been called by the Crown to prove that sexual abuse had occurred; rather, he had been called to show that he had made a report that was served on Ms B and what the contents of that report had been.
	
	
	Ms B submits that it is significant to consider the implications of Dr Waters’ report because it would not have protected her child; rather, it would have caused the child to go to the father. As noted earlier, that is not the recommendation that Dr Waters in fact made (as Ms B’s cross-examination of Dr Waters made clear when she adduced evidence from him that his doubts as to whether what had been disclosed had or had not occurred, why he had recommended the continuation of supervised access).
	
	
	Ms B’s complaint is not that her Honour wrongly made a ruling on inadmissibility of the report. There was no need for any such ruling since the report was not tendered by the Crown. Ms B does not now say that her Honour erred in not admitting the Dr Waters’ report, which she says was significant to show the risk her son was under, but she contends that her Honour denied her the opportunity to submit to the jury that an urgent application to the Family Court in March 2007 would not have succeeded based on that report. Ms B seems to wish to argue that her Honour should have ruled that Dr Waters should not have written the report at all (AT 22.35; 50).
	
	
	Ms B contends that her Honour should have found that Dr Waters was not an expert (for the purposes of the Family Court proceedings) (AT 24.7; T 24.20 but cf T 24.15) (or perhaps in general as to child sexual abuse) and that his report greatly added to her child’s risk and “pretty much sealed his fate” (AT 21.45). She contends that her Honour should have made that finding based on Professor Briggs’ evidence and Ms B’s own cross-examination of Dr Waters.
	
	
	Ms B maintains that if Dr Waters was not an expert his report would not be admissible and the imminent danger that Ms B feared could not have occurred. In essence, this is a complaint as to the evidence before the Family Court not the evidence at the trial. However, Ms B’s argument is that the fact that the report was not written by a child sexual abuse expert but was available in the Family Court proceedings is objective evidence that she would not have succeeded in an appeal or another interlocutory hearing and therefore could not have protected her child. That argument appears to rest on a misreading of the recommendations in the report but in any event is beside the point.
	
	
	Whether as framed in the notice of appeal or as articulated orally, ground 3 is not made out. Her Honour did not err in not admitting a report that was not tendered. Dr Waters’ evidence at the trial was as to the recommendations and conclusions he had made in his report as the court appointed expert in the Family Court proceedings. Whether he was suitably qualified to provide such a report was a matter for the Family Court judge to determine. He was not being called as an expert witness as such in the criminal proceedings against Ms B.
	
	
	Ground 3 is not made out.
	


Sentence appeal


	
	The Crown submissions on sentence were (at [19]) that a period of imprisonment was the only appropriate sentence but that, as Ms B had already served more than eight months’ imprisonment, this should be taken into account. It was submitted to her Honour that the effect of the comparative sentencing cases provided by the Court indicated that Ms B had, by reason of the eight months already spent in custody, already served a term of imprisonment comparable to those that had been handed down in broadly comparable cases.
	
	
	Ms B argues that the cases to which the Crown had referred were not comparable but does not suggest that any other or lesser sentence should have been imposed on her.
	
	
	Her Honour accepted (at [54]) that the conduct involved a very serious breach of the Family Law Act and that Ms B was the sole participant in the offence. Her Honour further accepted (at [55]) that the offence was deliberate and planned, although noting that there was very little planning involved beyond deciding in the week before she left: to leave the country taking her child to the doctor, getting her finances in order and purchasing the tickets. At [58] she said:
	


By reason of Ms B’s familiarity with the medical system overseas, she had hoped and expected that she could have the issue of what she genuinely believed to be her [child’s] abuse investigated above and beyond a single 20 minute interview with someone the child had not had an opportunity to develop any rapport with. Arranging such an investigation was not an easy task and in circumstances where her attempt to negotiate her way back had failed, which may have had something to do with the nature of the attempt, Ms B’s efforts to obtain an investigation ultimately resulted in her being placed on a university hospital waiting list.


	
	At [59], her Honour noted that in the result the child was kept away from Australia was two years, four months and 21 days and said that this was obviously a lengthy period for a child who was just three years eight months at the time he left the country. Her Honour also noted that the length of time was brought to an end by the actions of the father in his attempts to locate his child.
	
	
	At [60], her Honour accepted that the offending involved an intentional course of action designed to frustrate the ordinary process in the Family Court. However, her Honour also took into account “not by way of excuse, but as a matter reflecting upon the moral culpability of the offender, non-exculpatory self-defence, … arising out of what I am satisfied was the genuine belief that the child had been abused by [the] father”.
	
	
	Her Honour accepted (at [61]) that Ms B gave an honest account of the events and had genuinely held the belief that the child had been abused by the father. Her Honour said this was not a case of a person acting out of malice, rather the offender genuinely held the belief that the child had been so abused and was fearful for the safety of her and her child in light of the revelation about her husband’s mental condition and having observed his anger and desperation expressed in the circumstances in which he found himself. Her Honour accepted that Ms B sought but did not find the help and support she needed; “[s]he had the firm view, informed by her experience and researches, that the allegation had not and was not going to be properly investigated above and beyond the one ineffective interview of her [child]”.
	
	
	Her Honour also accepted (at [62]) the Crown’s submission that the nature of the action taken by the offender was extreme.
	
	
	At [63] her Honour said:
	


An issue arose in the sentencing proceedings about the admissibility of a victim impact statement read by Mr B. By commission of the offence for which the offender stands to be sentenced, the father did not see his [child] for a period of about two years, four months and 21 days. As might be expected for an offence of this type, he spoke of the distress suffered by him following upon the disappearance of his [child] and the adverse effects flowing from that event (ex B).


	
	Her Honour accepted that the principles stated in R v Constantine (1991) 25 NSWLR 431 (at 438F-439A), in relation to prosecution under the forerunner to the present section, were applicable; and noted the importance of the question of deterrence.
	
	
	Her Honour also noted that there was no evidence of contrition: Ms B having told the jury she still thought that she did the right thing and that there was no evidence about any cooperation with law enforcement agencies.
	
	
	Her Honour then took into account Ms B’s character and age, means, and physical and mental condition. Her Honour considered that Ms B had good prospects of rehabilitation.
	
	
	As to Ms B’s mental condition, her Honour noted that an issue had arisen as to this. At [78] her Honour said:
	


The issue arose in a highly unusual way. The offender provided the report of Dr R[obinson] to the Court. Dr R[obinson] prepared reports for the proceedings in the Family Court as the single court expert. She expressed the opinion that the offender suffers from a delusional disorder. The offender filed the reports together with submissions in the sentencing proceedings yet it is she who takes issue with the reports and the opinion proffered and effectively asked the Court to reject it.


	
	At [79]-[80], her Honour said:
	


Recognising the fact that in determining the appropriate sentence it is relevant to take into account the fact that an offender was suffering from a mental condition at the time of the commission of the offence or has a mental condition at the time of sentence, the Crown called Dr R[obinson] as a witness in the sentencing proceedings. That cross-examination is a matter of record. Extensive submissions have been filed.

The Crown submitted that Dr R[obinson]’s opinion that the offender suffers from a delusional disorder remains relevant on sentence regardless of whether or not the offender agrees with it and regardless of whether the offender wishes it to be taken into account. That is so.


	
	Nevertheless, her Honour said (at [84]) that there were some fundamental difficulties on the basis of the evidence and material placed before the Court in making a finding that Ms B has or had a delusional disorder, including that the reports were prepared for a different forum; some important issues were raised in the evidence yet Dr Robinson adhered to her opinion; Dr Robinson noted the difficulty in being cross-examined by the person she diagnosed with a delusional disorder; and Dr Robinson had also reported to the Family Court her opinion about whether the offender should have contact in the future with her child. Her Honour said:
	


I am not prepared to act on the material put before the Court in this regard in such circumstances. In my view if it were necessary to go on to make the relevant finding, independent evidence by an appropriately qualified expert who had read the trial transcripts and viewed the relevant exhibits would need to be provided.


	
	Her Honour also noted (at [85]) that it had been brought to the Court’s attention that on 26 March 2014 the Family Court had made orders to the effect that the child spend no time with the mother but may have electronic communication with her through Skype or the telephone when the child requests to do so. Her Honour said:
	


If the observations or opinion expressed by Dr R[obinson] in Exhibit D are accepted, it appears to the Court there is no or little prospect of the father agreeing to a variation of the orders by way of a parenting plan.


	
	Her Honour considered that a relevant factor to be taken into account was the fact that Ms B was now prohibited from spending any time with her child for the next eight years. Her Honour noted the likely difficulty or the potential for difficulty in electronic communication between the then nine year old child and the mother if the mother were in prison.
	
	
	At [91], her Honour said:
	


Even if I had thought it appropriate in all of the circumstances to impose any greater punishment than that already inflicted, which I now do not, I certainly do not think it appropriate to impose a penalty of the type that will take away the one connection the child has remaining with the mother (especially in circumstances where the Family Court considered it appropriate that connection be retained).


	
	Taking into account all of the matters being made known to the Court and having regard to the actual imprisonment already served, the course of events over the ensuring years (including the very limited and restricted time during which the offender has been allowed to spend time or communicate with her child) and the present circumstances which include the orders made by the Family Court, her Honour concluded that it was not appropriate at this time to impose any further or additional punishment in the nature of imprisonment full-time or otherwise. In the result, the sentence imposed on Ms B was not a custodial sentence even though her Honour considered that the offence that had been committed was a serious offence.
	
	
	As to the sentence appeal, the amended grounds of appeal are as follows:
	



	
	Her Honour erred in failing to make findings in regard to the diagnosis of delusional disorder and the inference that I suffered a mental illness.
	
	
	Her Honour erred in denying me the opportunity to cross examine [Mr B] on his Victim Impact Statement that he read into evidence in Court under oath.
	


Ground 1 – failure to make findings in relation to diagnosis of delusional order and inference that Ms B suffered a mental illness


	
	The circumstances in which this issue arose, as her Honour noted, are somewhat unusual. The matter had been listed for the sentencing hearing to take place on 4 December 2013. Both the Crown and Ms B had provided in advance written submissions on sentencing. The Crown raised as a preliminary issue that Ms B’s submissions had made reference to a report from Dr Robinson, who by then had been appointed as the single expert in the Family Court proceedings. Ms B had been ordered, over objection by her, to see Dr Robinson as part of the Family Court proceedings (AT 26.3). The Crown did not have a copy of that report but noted that Ms B had made reference in her submissions to a delusional disorder in the report. The Crown submitted that if Ms B is or was suffering from a delusional disorder that would be of relevance to penalty and might affect the Crown’s submission that a period of imprisonment was the only appropriate sentence.
	
	
	Ms B indicated that she wished to cross-examine Dr Robinson, asserting that Dr Robinson had committed serious offences. Apparently that allegation relates to Ms B’s belief that Dr Robinson had misrepresented and manipulated records. Ms B contended that the contents of the report were biased and misrepresented.
	
	
	The matter was listed for 28 February 2014 for the purpose of Ms B’s cross-examination of Dr Robinson (and for cross-examination of Mr B on his victim impact statement if permitted).
	
	
	Ms B then issued a subpoena for Dr Robinson to attend for cross-examination on the sentencing hearing but there appears to have been an issue as to the provision of insufficient conduct money for attendance at court of an expert witness. The matter was re-listed before her Honour on 14 February 2014, when the Crown indicated that it would subpoena Dr Robinson.
	
	
	On 28 February 2014, Ms B indicated that she wished to tender the report of Dr Robinson into evidence on the sentencing hearing, to rely on the fact that its contents were biased and misrepresented. Her Honour pointed out to Ms B that without the report being tendered by her the Court would have no knowledge of it and could not use it in any way in the determination of the sentence (the Crown not seeking on its own behalf to rely on the contents of the report).
	
	
	Ms B informed her Honour that she had to deal with the report and thought it was significant because her case was so impacted by Dr Waters’ report and his failure to investigate her son and:
	


… now here is another psychiatrist, who I will show, has done something similar and in fact possibly worse. I wish to show that these are the current circumstances and they are similar to the circumstances previously that I have faced in the Family Court. I want to show that this is what is happening and I still am struggling with this situation.


	
	Ms B also expressed the concern that Mr B was seeking to show the report to schools and mental health institutions and it would impact greatly on her current circumstances.
	
	
	The Crown then called Dr Robinson and tendered her report (Exhibit C). A non-publication order was made in relation to the exhibits given that they identified the son. Dr Robinson confirmed that she had made a diagnosis of “the psychotic illness delusional disorder” because Ms B “holds with absolute conviction the belief [her son] has been sexually abused by his father is valid and accurately reflects reality” but Dr Robinson said that the diagnosis did not relate to Ms B’s condition five years earlier, on which she considered it inappropriate to comment.
	
	
	Ms B cross-examined Dr Robinson at length, over two separate days, challenging her expertise in the area of child sexual abuse and challenging the opinion that Ms B now suffers from a delusional disorder. She did not, according to Dr Robinson, seek to cross-examine Dr Robinson in the Family Court proceedings for which that report had been prepared.
	
	
	During cross-examination, Dr Robinson accepted that she could not be categorical that nothing inappropriate had happened to the son. She said that certainly there were ambiguous behaviours by the son on 6 December 2007. However, Dr Robinson considered that Ms B’s response was “markedly concerning” in that Ms B had behaved as if the fact of abuse had been established, without being open to any other reasons for her son’s behaviour. Dr Robinson said that once Ms B had gained that conviction she had found other information to support her view and had gone “beyond” what Dr Robinson regarded as the normal or reasonable steps of a mother with that belief.
	
	
	Dr Robinson conceded that she had not tested the veracity of some of the information that was contained in the report (some of which she said she had included as part of what she referred to as the “longitudinal” history of the matter) but emphasised that her diagnosis was not one based on events viewed in isolation. While at the conclusion of the cross-examination Dr Robinson’s position was that (in hindsight) she would have reviewed her report in light of the matters raised in cross-examination, she also said she would not have revisited her opinion as to delusional disorder.
	
	
	Ultimately (at [84] of her Honour’s remarks on sentence), her Honour concluded that she was unable to make a finding that Ms B has or had a delusional disorder. Ms B now seeks to argue that her Honour ought to have made a positive finding that she does not suffer from a mental illness.
	
	
	Ms B submits that such a finding should have been made as it was objectively relevant to her credibility as a self-represented litigant and to her argument that the Family Court is making decisions based on unreliable and inadmissible expert reports (which she says contributed to her forced departure in 2008).
	
	
	Ms B further says that if Dr Robinson is correct and she has been delusional since 2008, then this would mean that the whole time that she had represented herself in the proceedings and in the appeal she was suffering from that disorder (AT 27.1).
	
	
	Ms B does not appear to be arguing any denial of procedural fairness in this regard but, rather, appears to be relying on the fact that she was able to conduct her defence as demonstrating that she is not suffering from a delusional disorder.
	
	
	One difficulty with a submission that, because Ms B had been able to conduct her case logically and rationally, she could not be suffering from a delusional disorder is that the definition of delusional disorder, as given by Dr Robinson, in effect acknowledges that delusions do not interfere with general logical reasoning (although within the delusional system the logic is perverted). Nor did Dr Robinson accept that, for there to be a delusional disorder, it was necessary that the belief be incorrect, explaining that delusional disorder incorporates the sense of not being able to entertain that their beliefs may be false or that there is no evidence for them; it being the way that Ms B holds her beliefs and their persistence and the way that judgments were made about information that led to Dr Robinson’s opinion. In any event this is not the issue.
	
	
	Ms B did not suggest that the failure to make a finding as to her mental state had impacted in any way adversely on the sentence imposed on her or that any different sentence should have been imposed having regard to her criticisms of the report (AT 27.30).
	
	
	It is the duty of the judge at sentence to determine the facts relevant to sentencing (R v Isaacs (1997) 41 NSWLR 374 at 377-378, cited with approval in Cheung v The Queen [2001] HCA 67; (2001) 209 CLR 1 at [14] per Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Hayne JJ; at [170] per Callinan J). The duty is limited to those facts that are relevant to the determination of the relevant issue (R v MacDonell (Court of Criminal Appeal (NSW), 8 December 1995, unrep) per Hunt CJ at CL).
	
	
	Findings of fact made against an offender by a sentencing judge must be arrived at beyond reasonable doubt. The practical effect of this is recognised as being that, in a given case, because the judge is required to resolve any reasonable doubt in favour of the accused, then the judge will be obliged, for that reason, to sentence upon a view of the facts which is most favourable to the offender (Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Hayne JJ in Cheung v The Queen at [14] and Callinan J at [170] citing R v Isaacs with approval on the question of fact finding following a jury verdict).
	
	
	The only relevance to Ms B’s sentencing of Dr Robinson’s report was that, if Ms B did suffer from a delusional disorder at the relevant time (or even at the present time) that would be a mitigating circumstance for the Court to take into account on sentencing. A finding that there was no delusional disorder would have no relevance other than to remove a potential mitigating factor. (Insofar as that would be a factual finding adverse on sentencing to Ms B, it would have to have been proved beyond reasonable doubt.)
	
	
	The Crown submitted to her Honour that the Court would have significant concerns that Ms B did have a delusional disorder and recognised that, if so, that would be a mitigating circumstance but said it would not be pressing for a positive finding that Ms B did suffer from a delusional disorder; suggesting instead that the Court take into account that Dr Robinson’s evidence provided some explanation as to the reason that the offence might have been committed.
	
	
	There was no expert evidence other than that from Dr Robinson on this issue. Ms B challenged, in her cross-examination of Dr Robinson, the factual basis for a number of matters referred to by Dr Robinson in the course of her report.
	
	
	The definition of delusional disorder to which Dr Robinson referred focussed, as I understand it, on the holding of a fixed view (as to the sexual abuse allegations) without being open to the possibility that there might be another explanation.
	
	
	Ms B accepts that she holds an unshakeable view that her son was sexually abused by his father. Though she did not accept in cross-examination at the trial that the only investigation she would accept was one that agreed with her view or that if anyone failed to support her concern as to the sexual abuse allegations then he or she was incompetent, biased or dishonest, Ms B has since 2008 made very serious allegations against a large number of people who have played a role in the Family Court proceedings or the steps taken once the abuse allegations were made.
	
	
	In that regard I note that Ms B expressed the belief to her lawyers in 2008 that all of the persons involved in the matter (the judge, her lawyers, the court appointed expert, the JIRT officers and the CPU) were “not unbiased” and has made similar allegations in her later correspondence with Professor Briggs. She has accused the Family Court judge of bias, dishonesty and a conflict of interest in having a professional relationship with the Court appointed expert (because the expert earns fees from the appointment), though her attempt to have the judge disqualified for bias was nevertheless unsuccessful. She has accused Dr Waters of bias and misrepresentation and maintains that he is not an expert at all in the area of child sexual abuse and holds extreme views (part of her criticism being that his assessment that she held an “overvalued idea” does not accord with any use of the term “overvalued” idea in the area of child sexual abuse literature). She has similarly accused Dr Robinson of misrepresentation.
	
	
	The stance taken by Ms B in her correspondence to Professor Briggs in 2009 (in parts of the letter that were not before the jury) was that she and her son had become victims of abuse from her husband, from the court appointed psychiatrist (who she described as dishonest and supporting her former husband), from the judge (which she said in cross-examination she meant in the way that he had created the orders and caused further harm), who she said she thought was biased or incompetent, from the CPU (who she says did not investigate properly), by the supervised contact centre (the co-ordinator of which was described in the letter as having given “full support” to Mr B threatening her son in contact sessions). She has accused DOCS of misrepresenting her and has accused Mr B’s solicitor of making false statements in court. She has accused Mr Christos Christaki (the independent children’s lawyer) of manipulation of the court process, insofar as she suggested that he had advised the contact centre of an incorrect date for production of material in answer to a subpoena.
	
	
	Ms B argued, at the sentencing hearing, that the Family Court has a small group of experts who were biased in reports to pervert the course of justice (submissions on sentencing at [60] – [62]) and says that she provided evidence that the Family Court appointed independent children’s lawyer, Mr Christaki, was not providing any independent view of the reports (8 November 2013, T 1063.44-1064).
	
	
	In her submissions on the conviction appeal, Ms B contends that the Family Court has caused endless litigation and appeals ([82]) and that The Hague failed effectively to implement clause 13(b) of The Hague Convention and prioritised international relations over child safety ([85]).
	
	
	However, whether or not the above matters could give rise to a conclusion that Ms B suffers from a delusional disorder, her Honour was not satisfied that such a finding could be made on the material before her. That conclusion has not been shown to be infected by any error, nor does Ms B complain about this. As to the complaint that her Honour did not go on to make a positive finding that there was no delusional disorder, suffice it to note that her Honour was not obliged, when sentencing, to make rulings on issues that were not determinative of, or relevant for, the purposes of making the decision her Honour had to make. Given the conclusion that her Honour reached in relation to sentencing, it was not necessary for her Honour to go further than to decline to make a ruling on delusional disorder. Moreover, the fact that Dr Robinson’s opinion was not accepted by her Honour as establishing on the balance of probabilities a delusional disorder (her Honour making it clear that she would have required further evidence on that issue) does not mean that the contrary conclusion had been established. Rather, it simply means that there was insufficient evidence for her Honour to draw a positive conclusion on that matter.
	
	
	Given that there were Family Court proceedings on foot in which rulings of that kind may have been required, it would have been inappropriate for her Honour to comment on that issue beyond making the ruling that her Honour did.
	
	
	Ms B was not able to indicate any basis on which the failure to make a ruling on this issue was something that had contributed to an error in her sentence. Insofar as she submitted that a finding of no delusional disorder would be relevant in other proceedings (such as the Family Court proceedings) this highlights why it is that her Honour was correct in declining to entertain such an issue.
	
	
	This ground is not made out.
	


Ground 2 – denial of opportunity to cross-examine the father on his victim impact statement


	
	Finally, Ms B claims she has been denied procedural fairness because she was not permitted to challenge Mr B on statements made by him under oath on 4 December 2013 when he read out his victim impact statement. A sealed copy of the victim impact statement was admitted as a confidential exhibit (Exhibit D) at the sentencing hearing. The reason that this evidence was given on oath was that Ms B had foreshadowed an intention to cross-examine Mr B.
	
	
	At the sentencing hearing there was an issue as to whether Mr B could be classified as a victim. Both parties prepared lengthy submissions on that issue. Ms B argued that the statement was inadmissible. She referred to the decision in R v Nahlous [2013] NSWCCA 90 at [107] and RP v R [2013] NSWCCA 192 at [18] (see addendum to submissions to cross-examine at [1] and [2]). In Nahlous, the Court found that it was not a mandatory requirement, when sentencing, to have regard to a statement by the family of the victim and hence there was no error in not doing so. It is not authority for the proposition that it is an error by a sentencing judge to have regard to such a statement, notwithstanding that the maker of the statement is not a “victim” as defined in the legislation.
	
	
	Her Honour refused to permit cross-examination, saying that cross-examination would not assist her. Her Honour made reference to the victim impact statement only in a very general way. She referred to the suffering of the kind one might expect of a parent who had lost contact with a child. Ms B’s response is that what Mr B missed was being able to “use” his child and had nothing to do with the welfare of the child. Ms B argues that it is speculation to assume that what Mr B experienced is what any normal parent would expect because he was very different from that. She alleges that Mr B went overseas “as an alibi” and using the persona of a victim to deflect from the crime he had committed. Ms B maintains that her Honour breached the principle that findings must be supported by evidence not speculation and that the inability to cross-examine Mr B goes to her sense of whether justice has been done.
	
	
	Section 16AB(6) of the Crimes Act 1914, which provides that a person convicted of an offence may only test the facts in a victim impact statement by way of cross-examining the maker of the statement and if the Court gives leave to do so, applies only to offences committed or alleged to have been committed on or after the amending provisions commenced on or after 29 June 2013 and hence did not apply.
	
	
	The object of the proposed cross-examination by Ms B of Mr B (supported by a 70 page submission document) was to establish that he was not a victim of a crime but a perpetrator of the crime. Ms B indicated in her submissions to her Honour that this evidence was likely to involve allegations of alleged rituals in the workplace of the father, allegations of sexual acts being committed by the father and unknown males on the child and that others, including Dr Waters, Mr Christaki and Dr Robinson, had engaged in cover ups, falsification or fabrication of evidence.
	
	
	Ms B says that she wanted to show that when Mr B said in his witness statement that he had not perpetrated any crime that was false (AT 33.8). She maintains that the publicity campaign by Mr B was highly inaccurate; defamatory and prejudicial to her case; that his travel to Europe to search for the child was “to avoid implications for investigation into sexual abuse offences” in his former work place; and she raised complaints as to the manner in which the child was reintroduced to the father.
	
	
	At [70] her Honour explained why she did not permit cross-examination of Mr B. Her Honour thought persuasive the Crown’s submission that granting leave to cross-examine was unlikely to have any significant impact on any penalty given the Crown concession that the time served in custody to date should be taken into account. Her Honour said she was and remained of the view that such cross-examination would not assist the Court in the determination of penalty.
	
	
	The Crown notes that the decision not to permit cross-examination was a discretionary decision and submits that no relevant error is demonstrated in the House v The King sense ([1936] HCA 40; (1936) 55 CLR 499). Ms B argues that error in that sense was established because her Honour acted on a wrong principle. Ms B identified that principle as being the principle of law that “if a person reads a statement out in Court under oath and the statement is adverse to a party, the party has the right to cross-examine”. She also contended that the comment by her Honour in the sentencing judgment (to the effect that one might properly accept, as a natural consequence of the offence, the distress of which Mr B had spoken in his victim impact statement) was speculative – her complaint in essence being that decisions were to be made based on evidence not speculation. Ms B says that her Honour erred in concluding that she would not be assisted by any cross-examination of Mr B on his victim impact statement because it was impossible to make that determination without knowing what evidence would have been elicited in cross-examination. She cites by way of example what she says emerged from the cross-examination of Dr Robinson (AT 33.13). (It is not necessary here to explore her criticisms of Dr Robinson’s report in that regard.)
	
	
	Ms B says that she wished to adduce evidence in her response to the victim impact statement that would prove that the assertions made by Mr B were inaccurate.
	
	
	In Beveridge v Dontan Pty Ltd (1991) 23 NSWLR 13, Rogers CJ Comm Div, after noting that cross-examination is recognised as an integral feature of adversarial litigation in the legal cultures that have their origin in English common law, said (at [12]), that it was an undoubted fact that “in ordinary court-conducted litigation today to deny a party completely the opportunity to cross-examine a witness would be a denial of natural justice”. There, the question arose in the context of a reference out to an expert of certain issues in the case. However, the Court also noted (at [13]) that the ultimate test, there having regard to the issues posed for reference to the referee and other matters, was whether each party had been given a fair opportunity to put his or her or its case and point of view. There was found to be no denial of natural justice in that case.
	
	
	In Wakim v Mathiew Pty Ltd [2002] NSWSC 405, the Court accepted that the requirements of natural justice may not confer on a party the right to cross-examine in a given case ([29]) and said that in determining whether or not the denial of the right to cross-examine constitutes a denial of natural justice in a given case it is necessary to consider the whole of the circumstances including the legislation, the general practice as understood by the parties and any acceptance by them as to the way in which the proceedings are to be conducted (at [30]).
	
	
	In GPI Leisure Corp Pty v Herdsman Investments Pty Ltd (No 3) (1990) 20 NSWLR 15, Young CJ in Eq, reviewed the authorities and said (at 22F) that the only actual right is the right to have a fair trial. His Honour also noted that in all proceedings the court has a duty to prevent cross-examination purely for a collateral purpose (at 23D).
	
	
	The victim impact statement was not applied in a way that was adverse to Ms B’s interests on sentence. In circumstances where it is clear from the sentence imposed by her Honour that reliance was not placed on the statements made by Mr B in his victim impact statement in a manner adverse to Ms B, there was no denial of natural justice in Ms B not being permitted to cross-examine Mr B, particularly where the indicated scope of cross-examination bore the hallmarks of cross-examination for a collateral purpose, namely to establish that Mr B had committed criminal offences against his son.
	
	
	Ground 2 of the sentence appeal is not made out.
	


Conclusion


	
	For the above reasons the appeal from conviction should be dismissed. As the merits of the sentence appeal have been fully argued, leave to appeal against sentence should be granted and the appeal dismissed.
	
	
	SIMPSON J: I have had the advantage of reading in draft the judgment of Ward JA. The following are my reasons for reaching the same conclusions.
	
	
	On 14 October 2013 the appellant was arraigned before a jury in the District Court on an indictment that charged that, on 24 April 2008, she committed an offence against s 65Y(1) of the Family Law Act 1975 (Cth). Section 65Y provides as follows:
	


“65Y  Obligations if certain parenting orders have been made

(1)  If a parenting order to which this Subdivision applies is in force, a person who was a party to the proceedings in which the order was made, or a person who is acting on behalf of, or at the request of, a party, must not take or send the child concerned from Australia to a place outside Australia except as permitted by subsection (2).

Penalty:  Imprisonment for 3 years.

Note:  The ancillary offence provisions of the Criminal Code, including section 11.1 (attempts), apply in relation to the offence created by subsection (1).

(2)  Subsection (1) does not prohibit taking or sending the child from Australia to a place outside Australia if:

(a)  it is done with the consent in writing (authenticated as prescribed) of each person in whose favour the order referred to in subsection (1) was made; or

(b)  it is done in accordance with an order of a court made, under this Part or under a law of a State or Territory, at the time of, or after, the making of the order referred to in subsection (1).

Note:  A defendant bears an evidential burden in relation to the matter in subsection (2) (see subsection 13.3(3) of the Criminal Code).”


	
	At the trial, the appellant was not legally represented. She conducted her own defence.
	
	
	The Crown case at trial proceeded over a week, closing on 21 October 2013. The appellant gave evidence. Her evidence in chief proceeded over five days; she was cross-examined over three days. She called three witnesses and tendered a considerable volume of documentation. It was not in issue that:
	



	
	a relevant parenting order was in force;
	
	
	the appellant was a party to the proceedings in which the order was made; and
	
	
	the appellant had taken the child the subject of the parenting order from Australia to a place outside Australia; and
	
	
	neither of the circumstances set out in s 65Y(2) obtained.
	



	
	On 20 November 2013 the jury returned a verdict of guilty. On 29 May 2014, pursuant to s 20(1)(a) of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth), Woodburne DCJ, without passing sentence, released the appellant on recognizance to be of good behaviour for 28 days from that date.
	
	
	By Notice of Appeal filed on 29 August 2014 the appellant appeals against the conviction, and seeks leave to appeal against the “sentence”. She has again appeared unrepresented, and conducted her own appeal.
	
	
	At trial, the appellant sought to rely on certain provisions of the Criminal Code (Cth) (“the Code”). Part 2.3 of the Code has the general title “Circumstances in which there is no criminal responsibility”. The provisions upon which the appellant sought to rely were s 10.3 and s 10.4 which appear in Pt 2.3. It will be convenient to refer to these sections as providing “defences”. It was to these defences that the evidence given and adduced by the appellant went.
	
	
	Section 10.3 and 10.4 provide as follows:
	


“10.3  Sudden or extraordinary emergency

(1)  A person is not criminally responsible for an offence if he or she carries out the conduct constituting the offence in response to circumstances of sudden or extraordinary emergency.

(2)  This section applies if and only if the person carrying out the conduct reasonably believes that:

(a)  circumstances of sudden or extraordinary emergency exist; and

(b)  committing the offence is the only reasonable way to deal with the emergency; and

(c)  the conduct is a reasonable response to the emergency.

10.4  Self-defence

(1)  A person is not criminally responsible for an offence if he or she carries out the conduct constituting the offence in self-defence.

(2)  A person carries out conduct in self-defence if and only if he or she believes the conduct is necessary:

(a)  to defend himself or herself or another person; or

(b)  to prevent or terminate the unlawful imprisonment of himself or herself or another person; or

(c)  to protect property from unlawful appropriation, destruction, damage or interference; or

(d)  to prevent criminal trespass to any land or premises; or

(e)  to remove from any land or premises a person who is committing criminal trespass;

and the conduct is a reasonable response in the circumstances as he or she perceives them.

(3)  This section does not apply if the person uses force that involves the intentional infliction of death or really serious injury:

(a)  to protect property; or

(b)  to prevent criminal trespass; or

(c)  to remove a person who is committing criminal trespass.

(4)  This section does not apply if:

(a)  the person is responding to lawful conduct; and

(b)  he or she knew that the conduct was lawful.

However, conduct is not lawful merely because the person carrying it out is not criminally responsible for it.”

In relation to s 10.3, the appellant asserted that her conduct was carried out in response to an “extraordinary” (not “sudden”) emergency. In relation to s 10.4, she relied upon sub-s (2)(a) - that is, she asserted that she believed that the conduct was necessary to defend herself and/or another person (her son, who was the child the subject of the parenting order).


	
	Section 13.3 of the Code provides as follows:
	


“13.3  Evidential burden of proof--defence

(1)  Subject to section 13.4, a burden of proof that a law imposes on a defendant is an evidential burden only.

(2)  A defendant who wishes to deny criminal responsibility by relying on a provision of Part 2.3 (other than section 7.3) bears an evidential burden in relation to that matter.

(3)  A defendant who wishes to rely on any exception, exemption, excuse, qualification or justification provided by the law creating an offence bears an evidential burden in relation to that matter. The exception, exemption, excuse, qualification or justification need not accompany the description of the offence.

(4)  The defendant no longer bears the evidential burden in relation to a matter if evidence sufficient to discharge the burden is adduced by the prosecution or by the court.

(5)  The question whether an evidential burden has been discharged is one of law.

(6)  In this Code:

‘evidential burden’, in relation to a matter, means the burden of adducing or pointing to evidence that suggests a reasonable possibility that the matter exists or does not exist.”

By s 13.1(2), where a defendant has discharged the evidential burden, the onus shifts to the prosecution to disprove the matters raised.


	
	At the conclusion of the defence case, Woodburne DCJ ruled that the defences would not be permitted to go to the jury. She gave detailed and comprehensive reasons: R v B (No 2) (NSWDC, 15 November 2013, unreported).
	
	
	The appellant pleads three grounds of appeal against conviction. The refusal to allow the defences to go to the jury gives rise to the first ground of appeal against conviction. The second ground involves rulings made and directions given to the jury concerning a factual matter. The final ground concerns what is asserted to be a failure to make findings on the admissibility of a psychiatric report.
	
	
	The grounds of appeal against sentence involve an asserted failure to make certain findings concerning the appellant’s mental condition, and a ruling preventing the appellant from cross-examining the maker of a victim impact statement.
	


The Crown case


	
	The facts giving rise to the Crown case were essentially uncontested.
	
	
	As at 2008, the appellant was married to a man to whom (in conformity with the judgment of Ward JA) I will refer as Mr B. The appellant and Mr B had a son (A) who was born in August 2004. In 2008 the appellant became convinced that Mr B had been sexually molesting A. She reported her concerns to the Department of Community Services (“DOCS”), and the child was referred to the Child Protection Unit. A was spoken to by representatives of that Department and police, constituting the Joint Investigation Response Team (“JIRT”). JIRT is an interagency investigative team, involving police and DOCS, the function of which is to investigate allegations of sexual abuse of children. Nothing came of that interview.
	
	
	On 1 January 2008 the appellant left the home she had shared with Mr B. She took A with her, and found alternative accommodation. Mr B unsuccessfully attempted reconciliation. On 31 January 2008 the appellant wrote two letters to Mr B, telling him of her belief that he had been sexually abusing A, and that she would not allow Mr B to have any further contact with A.
	
	
	There followed some correspondence between Mr B, his solicitor, and the appellant. On 18 February 2008 Mr B filed an application in the Family Court of Australia. The primary order he sought was that he be granted “the parental responsibility” for A, with provision for contact between the child and the appellant.
	
	
	On 28 February 2008 the appellant made a similar application, seeking an order that she be given parental responsibility, and ancillary orders. One of the ancillary orders she sought was that there be no order as to the child spending time with Mr B.
	
	
	On 29 February 2008 the Family Court made interim orders. Order 2 required the appellant and Mr B to cooperate in arranging for an assessment by the Central West Children’s Contact Service (“the Contact Centre”) as to the suitability of Mr B and A to have supervised contact visits. Order 4 was an order (provisional upon an assessment by the Contact Centre of suitability for supervised contact visits) for Mr B to spend specified time with A. It was common ground that Order 4 was “a parenting order” for the purpose of s 65Y of the Family Law Act.
	
	
	On 25 March 2008 the Contact Centre notified Mr B and the appellant that the applications for supervised contact had been approved, and set out a fortnightly programme for the visits. Thereafter, a number of visits took place, at the Contact Centre, under the supervision of staff.
	
	
	On 23 April 2008 the appellant purchased airline tickets for herself and A to travel to Europe. The following day, 24 April, they flew out of Australia. No consent within the meaning of s 65Y(2)(a) had been given by Mr B; and no order of a court, within the meaning of s 65Y(2)(b), had been made.
	
	
	Accordingly, the Crown case was that the appellant had committed an offence against s 65Y(1). All of the essentials of an offence against s 65Y(1) were made out. So much was not in issue in the trial.
	
	
	For completeness, it may be recorded that, in September 2010, the appellant and A were located in Amsterdam, and were taken into custody. The appellant returned to Australia, in custody. A was placed in the care of Mr B.
	


The defences


	
	By s 13.3(3) of the Code, the appellant bore “an evidential burden” in relation to both defences. Accordingly, in relation to the defence under s 10.3(1), the appellant bore an evidential burden in relation to the proposition that she reasonably believed:
	



	
	that circumstances of extraordinary (she did not rely on “sudden”) emergency existed;
	
	
	that committing the offence against s 65Y(1) of the Family Law Act was the only reasonable way to deal with the emergency; and
	
	
	that her conduct was a reasonable response to the emergency.
	



	
	In relation to the defence under s 10.4 (in the circumstances of this case), the appellant bore an evidential burden in relation to the propositions:
	



	
	that she believed that the conduct (of removing A from Australia, in breach of s 65Y) was necessary to defend herself or A; and
	
	
	that her conduct was a reasonable response in the circumstances as she perceived them.
	



	
	In order to discharge these evidential burdens, it was necessary, by s 13.3(6), that she adduce, or point to, evidence that suggested a reasonable possibility that those circumstances (or, to use the language of s 13.3(6), those “matters”) existed.
	
	
	There are two limbs to the defence under s 10.3, as to each of which a defendant must adduce or point to evidence. The first limb concerns the belief of the defendant as to the three elements stated in sub-s (2). The belief as to which evidence is required is a subjective belief of the defendant.
	
	
	The second limb also concerns the defendant’s belief, but, in this case, the evidence that is required is evidence that would support the proposition that the subjective beliefs were reasonable. Reasonableness of the beliefs is to be assessed objectively: Oblach v R [2005] NSWCCA 440; 65 NSWLR 75 at [59].
	
	
	Section 10.4 also has two limbs. The first concerns the belief of the defendant that the conduct in question is necessary to defend himself/herself or another person. That belief also is a subjective belief. The second limb in s 10.4 concerns the reasonableness of the response made by the defendant. That calls for an objective assessment, but in the light of circumstances as perceived by the defendant.
	
	
	Whether the appellant succeeded in discharging the evidential burden in relation to either defence was a question of law for the trial judge (s 13.3(5)). Such a burden may be discharged by “slender evidence”. Any evidence adduced or pointed to in support of either defence must be taken at its most favourable to the appellant: The Queen v Khazaal [2012] HCA 26; 246 CLR 601 at [74].
	


The defence case


	
	The appellant gave evidence over the period mentioned. Her evidence was intended to be directed to the matters necessary to establish the defences provided by s 10.3(1) and s 10.4(1) of the Code. However, it ranged well beyond those matters, no doubt due to her unrepresented status.
	
	
	She gave a lengthy account of the reasons that led her to conclude that Mr B had sexually abused A.
	
	
	She produced a large volume of documentary material. So far as the rules of evidence were concerned, she was given a great deal of latitude, both in her oral evidence and in the documents that were admitted on her tender. Some of her oral evidence was given by her reading from affidavits she had filed in Family Court proceedings, and by reading from other documents, some of which became exhibits. By way of example of the latitude afforded to her, a number of communications (usually email) between herself and her various advisers were admitted apparently (in the absence of any limitation imposed under s 136 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW)), as evidence of the truth of their contents.
	
	
	The appellant’s evidence (stripped of irrelevancies) was to the following effect.
	
	
	Her concerns about A began when she returned from a business trip in June 2007. Carers at the day care centre that A attended questioned her about his behaviour in relation to other children. The appellant gave a number of instances of concern about A’s behaviour, from her own observations and reports or comments from others. She then gave a rather graphic description of an interaction, on 6 December 2007, between herself and A, from which she drew the firm conclusion that Mr B had been sexually interfering with A. The following day she consulted a general practitioner, who appropriately made a report to DOCS and referred her to the North Shore Child Protection Unit (“the NSCPU”). She was dissatisfied with the investigations made by those authorities. In evidence, she said:
	


“The other thing that happened was the Child Protection people, they basically said because of his little age, if he can’t provide a statement - they said the legal system is not very good at dealing with children of this little age and that it’s very likely that he will get unsupervised time with his father and so they said whilst you’re in the house, you can protect him, but by the time I went through the next steps and I got to my lawyers, my lawyer said, ‘If you stay in the house, people will blame you for not protecting him, not leaving,’ so no one actually - the lawyer suggested I leave but up until I met them in January, no one told me what to do, they just said, ‘Well it’s up to you,’ and so it was quite complicated because I didn’t really know.”


	
	The general practitioner made notes of the consultation with the appellant (Ex 10). The appellant, as she was advised, took A to the Child Protection Unit, and he was interviewed by representatives of JIRT. As mentioned above, the interview was unproductive.
	
	
	On 11 December 2007 the NSCPU informed JIRT that it would “close the case”. On 19 February DOCS also finalised its investigations and noted “Case to be closed no further action”.
	
	
	The appellant gave the following evidence:
	


“… my recollection of what [the representatives of JIRT] said to me was even if he had disclosed sexual abuse the judge would not accept it unless he can prove that he understands the concept of truth and lies … It seemed like there was no possibility because even if he had disclosed it wouldn’t have helped. So JIRT recommended I take [A] to ongoing counselling at Ryde. So they told me they will only do that one interview, and then - they said, ‘But if you take him to Ryde Community Centre they can have sessions with him and maybe in that course of sessions he would disclose.’ But Ryde Community Centre would not meet with [A]. They said, ‘We will only have meetings with you and teach you how to teach [A] to protect himself, but we won’t see [A], ‘because, they told me, they are afraid that the Family Law Court could accuse them of trying to solicit a disclosure’.” (T 716)


	
	The appellant then sought assistance from various other institutions or agencies. She said that she was advised that it was unlikely that the Family Court would “automatically” stop Mr B from seeing A if she and Mr B separated. She said she felt “completely powerless to protect [A]”. On 24 December she again consulted a general practitioner.
	
	
	There was increasing conflict between the appellant and Mr B. He appeared to be suffering from “moods”. On 22 December 2007 Mr B sought to explain his moods. He told the appellant of an unsatisfactory upbringing and said that he had been using prescribed anti-depressant medication, but had ceased taking it. The appellant observed Mr B to be more actively engaging with A, playing games and the like, which A called “tickle games”.
	
	
	On 1 January 2008 Mr B confronted the appellant about the impediments she was increasingly placing in the way of his engagement with A. He then gave an account of an incident that involved A urinating in a park that he said had occurred while the appellant was away on a business trip.
	
	
	The appellant formed the view that Mr B knew what her concerns were and that he was giving various explanations that he hoped would exculpate him from allegations of sexual abuse.
	
	
	On 1 January 2008 the appellant and A moved out of the home, and lived, for a time, with her brother. The appellant believed that A was “doing sexual things” with her brother.
	
	
	The appellant therefore sought legal advice. She engaged a firm of solicitors called Musgrave Peach who gave her, inter alia, the following advice:
	


“Please be mindful of your safety as it is difficult to predict how your former partner will react to such allegations. We do not advise waiting (illegible word) prior to making an Application. It is clear from his conversation with your mother that he intends to seek ot [sic] spend time with [A]. It is very important at this stage that you seek an order that [A] live with you and that there be no order as to [A] spending time with his father …”


	
	On 27 January 2008 the appellant returned home for the purpose of removing some of her belongings. Mr B made statements which indicated that he had experienced some suicidal thoughts. The appellant feared that he might attempt to harm her, or A, or both.
	
	
	On 30 January 2008 the appellant wrote to Mr B. She told him that their relationship was over, and that she did not want A to have any further contact with Mr B. This apparently caused Mr B to consult solicitors, and a process of negotiation began. On 5 February, Mr B’s solicitor wrote to the appellant. They recorded that Mr B denied any sexual misconduct with A, but said that, nevertheless, he was willing to cooperate in an investigation of the appellant’s allegations. They suggested the names of three psychiatrists who might take part in the process. One of the names they mentioned was Dr Brent Waters.
	
	
	The response made by her solicitors on the appellant’s behalf was to agree to the expert investigation, but to maintain her opposition to any contact between A and Mr B.
	
	
	On 28 February 2008 (as set out above) the appellant and Mr B attended the Family Court. The appellant was confident that an order would be made refusing Mr B any contact with A. That did not happen. Instead, the orders referred to above ([226]) were made. An Independent Children’s Lawyer was appointed to represent the interests of A.
	
	
	The appellant found the proceedings unsatisfactory and demeaning. She said:
	


“We went to the Court on 29 [sic] February and I had never been in a court before, I had never had any of these sorts of proceedings. And I had instructed my lawyers that I don’t want any contact with - for [Mr B] to have any contact with [A]. And I fully expected that I would get that because of the circumstances. And I was absolutely astounded at what happened in court. You know, the judge referred to [Mr B] and he called me ‘she’ and, you know, ‘what days does she work?’ and, ‘[Mr B] what days would you like for contact?’ and it was incredible. And he - to me it was incredible …”

According to the appellant’s evidence, the next court date was fixed for some time in June.


	
	Contrary to the appellant’s preference, Dr Waters was appointed as a court expert to prepare a report in relation to the welfare of A, and specified certain matters he was requested to consider. The appellant was unhappy about this because she had read some of his writings, which she interpreted as being biased against women who made allegations of sexual impropriety against their partners. She was concerned about Dr Waters’ “integrity” and “the quality of his advice”.
	
	
	She said that the judge then “ordered that I have an injunction of silence placed against me” in order to avoid damage to Mr B’s career, but made no equivalent order against Mr B. She took that to mean that she could not discuss the issues other than with her counsellor, but that Mr B was free to discuss the issues as he pleased. (It is worth interpolating here that Order 6 of the orders made on 29 February was as follows:
	


“The mother is restrained from providing information about the allegations in this case and particularly her allegations of the father’s sexual abuse of [A], to any person or organization other than information the mother provides to a person or organization with whom she seeks legal advice in relation to this case, information sought by Dr Waters or any information that the mother provides to her own treating professional.”

It might be taken that no equivalent order was made in relation to Mr B because there was no evidence that he had been making allegations of the kind the subject of Order 6.)


	
	The appellant was very unhappy and concerned about the order for supervised contact with Mr B, and sought further advice about that. She was advised that an appeal would cost $14,000 and that the prospects that an appeal would succeed were very remote. She said that she had inadequate funds to pursue an appeal.
	
	
	On 10 March 2008 Messrs Musgrave Peach gave Notice of Ceasing to Act for the appellant. The reason appears to be their apprehension that she had lost confidence in their services. The appellant then sought advice from a Community Legal Centre, and subsequently from another firm of private solicitors.
	
	
	On 20 March the appellant sought advice from another barrister, seeking among other things, advice about an appeal against the Family Court orders.
	
	
	On 25 March the Contact Centre approved the supervised contact between Mr B and A that had been proposed by the Family Court, and notified the appellant of the times and dates for which contact had been arranged. The first was the same day, 25 March. These were for seven 2 hour sessions each fortnight. There were then six subsequent contact visits, the last on 22 April. The appellant took A to the Centre, as required, on these occasions. She developed a concern that Mr B was giving A lollies and inappropriate gifts. She therefore told the Contact Centre that she did not want A given lollies, as these were “directly linked to the abuse of child”.
	
	
	On 3 April Dr Waters provided a report. (The report was not in evidence. Dr Waters gave brief evidence in the prosecution case and was extensively cross-examined by the appellant.) He suggested a reduction in, although not elimination of, the contact visits. Dr Waters expressed doubts as to whether A had been sexually abused. The appellant received this report shortly before she left the country, but did not read it with any care.
	
	
	In the light of Dr Waters’ report, Mr B’s solicitors suggested that supervision of his contact visits with A was no longer necessary.
	
	
	The appellant continued to observe what she regarded as inappropriate and deteriorating behaviour on the part of A. She continued to communicate with JIRT and “child protection”. She put A’s deteriorating behaviour, as she observed it, down to what happened during visits with Mr B at the Contact Centre. She became extremely concerned about Mr B and “what he might do”. She said:
	


“And because the next court date wasn’t until June I had to take [A] for another 34 hours of intense contact one on one with [Mr B]. And given that the lawyers had told me, there was nothing I could do before that court date to stop that or to reduce that, so I was getting very - it was very distressing to be sitting up every night with my little boy and to be in that situation … I had thoroughly investigated, from my perspective, every possible avenue. I was speaking to experts and the lawyers. I thought that the lawyers were advising on every possible avenue I could take with the courts and I just did not accept the situation.”

She came to the belief that the supervision afforded during the visits was inadequate. The appellant provided a great deal of detail about A’s conduct, which included apparently sexualised behaviour, inappropriate (even for a three year old) excretory functioning and bedwetting. The inference she drew from this conduct was that Mr B was continuing sexually to abuse A, including during the supervised contact visits.


	
	The appellant had come into possession of a book entitled “Child Abuse and Family Law” which she read and which she found accorded with her own views. She said:
	


“What first impressed me in the book is it explained how on earth a Family Court judge could order four contact visits a week with a man, from my perspective, who was suicidal and mentally ill. It was obviously inappropriate to me before he had even been investigated. It wasn’t because [Mr B] has a mental illness or takes medication because there are many people that do that. It was the fact that it wasn’t stable and he was struggling with it. He wasn’t dealing with it well.

The book confirmed to me that child abuse in general was a very real issue and shouldn’t be dismissed the way it is sometimes dismissed by the authorities. It explained to me that investigations were superficial and insufficient. It confirmed my concerns about that. It also confirmed my concerns that this supervised contact just cannot be appropriate and was wrong in those circumstances and that child abusers can manipulate and get at children even when they are being supervised. The book explained that the system needs changing and that was certainly my experience.”


	
	The appellant read other material concerning the manner in which allegations of child sexual abuse are dealt with in the courts. Putting her own experience together with what she had read, ultimately the appellant formed an adverse view of everybody involved in the legal process with which she was involved - judges, solicitors, barristers, Dr Waters, JIRT and child protection officers. She formed the view that she (and A) would not be able to get justice, or a reasonable assessment of her claims, from the Family Court. She decided to seek independent assessment overseas. Predominantly, it seems, this was to avoid Dr Waters.
	
	
	The appellant gave evidence that if she thought that the authorities would have investigated adequately, or “done something”, she would not have had to leave. It was clear that the “something” she wanted done was the cessation of all contact between A and Mr B.
	
	
	The appellant saw herself as having “two bad options to choose from”. She put them as follows:
	


“One, [A] keeps deteriorating and maybe [Mr B] does what I’m worried he might do and I just hang on until we get to court and maybe they would reduce contact and maybe they would not, and maybe they would give [A] to [Mr B] because now we had this report saying, ‘I don’t think abuse has happened’ or I do the other bad option which is just to leave.”

She chose the second “bad option”.


	
	There was evidence of communications made by the appellant after she had left Australia that cast some light on her state of mind and reasoning processes. One of the persons the appellant contacted while she was overseas was Professor Freda Briggs, an academic with experience in child protection. Although these communications add detail to what has been said above, they do not further advance any issue relevant to the appeal.
	
	
	The appellant had equipped herself with a small recording device, with a view to recording any statements A might make, but her lawyers advised against using it, telling her to “document” instead anything that A said.
	
	
	There was a great deal more evidence in the appellant’s case, but the above adequately identifies the position she was in as she saw it, which gave rise to her decision to leave the country with A.
	
	
	Professor Freda Briggs was called in the Crown case by videolink, on 28 October. On the previous hearing day, some issues had arisen concerning the admissibility of evidence. Some of these issues concerned evidence that the appellant proposed to adduce, in cross-examination, from Professor Briggs. In a judgment dated 25 October (that is, before Professor Briggs was called) Woodburne DCJ made rulings, and gave reasons. One of the rulings was that the truth of the sexual abuse allegations was not relevant to the issues in the trial. Included in the judgment was the following:
	


“However, the accused has indicated she is going to go on to ask Prof Briggs to comment on the JIRT video. That exercise would appear to be irrelevant to the proceedings in that it must be borne in mind these proceedings are not concerned with a review of whether or not the child was in fact was sexually assaulted, and her opinion as to what may or may not be derived from that video is not relevant to the proceedings. I distinguish that, however, from the area that was earlier mentioned about her opinion about the investigations that might be undertaken and the necessity perhaps to have more than one interview.”


	
	Professor Briggs gave evidence that the appellant contacted her some time in 2008, from Frankfurt in Germany. She gave evidence of a lengthy communication sent to her by the appellant early in 2009. The content of that communication was read to the jury by the Crown prosecutor (for what purpose is not clear to me). Professor Briggs was cross-examined by the appellant.
	
	
	At the conclusion of the oral evidence, the appellant tendered some additional documentary material. It appears that this evidence consisted of two documents in which Professor Briggs offered certain opinions as to the veracity of the claims of sexual abuse.
	
	
	On 14 November, when the oral evidence in both the prosecution and defence cases had concluded, various other issues concerning the admissibility of evidence and other legal issues were discussed. It seems (T 1168) that the appellant wished to tender a document identified as “MFI 83”, in which Professor Briggs had offered some opinions. Woodburne DCJ gave another brief judgment, in which she said:
	


“I am not going to admit this evidence of Prof Briggs on this issue. The relevance of this is as originally flagged, as the jury can be directed, is that it shows the child was making disclosures of the type that the accused said he was making. Although Mr Crown cross-examined the accused on the reasonableness of conclusions she drew from what was said, as well as the circumstances in which the further disclosure was made, it is clear from MFI 83 that this portion of Prof Briggs’ evidence goes to the likelihood of the disclosures being true, and that is a question that it is not appropriate for the jury to be diverted into consideration of. So the court proposes not to admit the evidence before the jury.”


	
	This ruling and the ruling of 25 October have given rise to the second ground of appeal.
	
	
	Also called to give evidence in the Crown case was Dr Waters. As mentioned above, Dr Waters had, prior to the appellant’s departure, provided a report, although that report is not in evidence. The manner in which the report of Dr Waters was dealt is the subject of the third ground of appeal, and, I might add, the subject of a great deal of confusion. I will come to that when I deal with Ground 3.
	
	
	Before the jury was empanelled, there were two days of discussion of evidentiary and procedural matters. It was known that the appellant proposed to raise the defences under s 10.3 and s 10.4 of the Code. At an early stage, Woodburne DCJ asked the appellant to specify “the sudden or extraordinary emergency” on which she wished to rely.
	
	
	The appellant’s reply was lengthy, discursive, non-specific, and rather difficult to understand. What does emerge from it is that the extraordinary emergency that she believed existed was not an emergency concerning apprehended future sexual abuse of A; it concerned an apprehension that Mr B was potentially homicidal and that A, and herself, were in physical danger. This fear was based upon an earlier statement by Mr B that he had experienced suicidal thoughts, her later awareness of his long-standing psychiatric condition, her realisation that she had exposed allegations of sexual abuse against him, and that he was “very, very angry”.
	
	
	The appellant gave a similar answer in relation to the defence under s 10.4.
	


The grounds of appeal


	
	The grounds of appeal were pleaded, in a document entitled “Amended Grounds of Appeal Conviction”, as follows:
	


“1.  Her Honour erred in withholding my defences from the jury on the ground that I had a right of appeal and therefore the evidence was not capable of supporting the possibility that I reasonably believed that committing the offence was the only reasonable way to deal with the emergency and on the ground that my conduct was not a reasonable response in the circumstances as I perceived them because I had the right to be heard at any hearing for a parenting application and the right to appeal the decision (Judgment R v B (No 2) at [108], s 10.3(2)(b) at [130] and [134] - s 10.4(2) of the Code respectively).

2.  Her Honour erred in ruling that the question of whether [Mr B] sexually abused [A] was not relevant and therefore not to be considered in this trial. Her Honour erred in directing the jury not to consider whether [Mr B] did sexually abuse [A] and in directing me not to adduce evidence for that purpose.

3.  Her Honour erred in failing to make findings on the admissibility of Dr Waters report and specifically its impact on any future Court proceeding and therefore my ability to succeed at an appeal or any application for parenting orders.” (italics in original)

Ground 1: “withholding proposed defences from the jury”


	
	As set out above, the defences upon which the appellant sought to rely were the statutory defences provided by s 10.3 (“extraordinary emergency”) and s 10.4 (self-defence/defence of another). Both are set out in full above, together with s 13.3, which explains how the provisions creating the defences are to be dealt with. By s 13.3(2), the appellant bore an “evidential burden” in relation to each of the defences she invoked.
	


Section 10.3


	
	By a combination of s 10.3 and s 13.3, before the defence of extraordinary emergency could be left to the jury, it was necessary that the following questions be answered affirmatively:
	



	
	was the evidence sufficient to suggest a reasonable possibility that the appellant believed:
	



	
	that circumstances of extraordinary emergency existed; and
	
	
	that committing an offence against s 65Y of the Family Law Act (that is, removing A from Australia) was the only reasonable way to deal with the emergency; and
	
	
	that her conduct was a reasonable response to the emergency.
	


(There may be a question as to what the third adds to the second, but that can be passed over.)

It should be emphasised that this question focusses purely upon the appellant’s subjective beliefs. And it can be mentioned again that the burden may be discharged by only slender evidence, and that the evidence must be taken at its most favourable to the appellant.


	
	If question (i) is answered affirmatively (that is, as to all three elements) the second question is:
	


(ii)  was the evidence sufficient to suggest a reasonable possibility that the appellant’s beliefs were (objectively) reasonable?


	
	If this question also is answered affirmatively, the onus shifts to the Crown to negative the defence. This could be achieved by proof that the appellant did not (in fact) hold any one of the beliefs referred to in question (i); or that the appellant’s belief as to any one of the three elements was not (objectively) reasonable.
	
	
	The corresponding questions with respect to s 10.4 are:
	


(i)  was the evidence sufficient to suggest a reasonable possibility that the appellant believed that removing A from Australia was necessary to defend A?

Again, the focus is on the appellant’s subjective beliefs.

If the answer to (i) is affirmative:

(ii)  was removing A from Australia a reasonable response to the circumstances as the appellant perceived them?

Question (ii) poses an objective test, but is to be answered taking into account the circumstances as the appellant subjectively perceived them.


	
	Woodburne DCJ held that the appellant had, in respect of each defence, failed to discharge the evidential burden.
	
	
	In her carefully considered and comprehensive judgment she analysed the evidence and the competing arguments. She dealt with the questions relating to each defence compendiously.
	
	
	At [61] and [73] she held that the appellant had discharged the evidential burden as to her belief that an extraordinary emergency existed. Although she did not say so expressly, it seems that that finding extended to the reasonable possibility that that belief was reasonable.
	
	
	However, at [108] she held that the appellant had failed to discharge the evidential burden with respect to a reasonable belief that committing an offence against s 65Y was the only reasonable way to deal with the emergency. On what basis she made that finding is not entirely clear. The finding is expressed as follows:
	


“108  In circumstances where the accused had a right of appeal the evidence is not capable of supporting the possibility that the accused reasonably believed that committing the offence was the only reasonable way to deal with the emergency.” (italics in original)


	
	Prior to reaching that conclusion, her Honour recounted, in some detail, the competing arguments of the parties. She considered an argument put by the Crown that the appellant had available to her alternatives to taking A from Australia. Those alternatives proposed by the Crown are set out in [78] and were that the appellant could have:
	


“(a)  Appealed the order of the judge;

(b)  Brought an urgent application in the Family Court (relying on fresh evidence of supposed deterioration of the child);

(c)  Told the Contact Centre details of her concerns, and asked them to be extra vigilant;

(d)  Not cooperated with the Contact Centre causing it to refuse to supervise future contact session [sic];

(e)  Not taken the child to Contact Centre at all;

(f)  Sought medical certificates excusing the child from attending contact;

(g)  Taken the child to police/JIRT/DOCS for investigation of the alleged threat;

(h)  Moved interstate.”


	
	Most of these her Honour appears (correctly, in my opinion) to have rejected. However, she does appear to have accepted that an available alternative open to the appellant was to appeal against the Family Court orders of 29 February.
	
	
	It seems to me that her Honour found that the appellant had failed to discharge the evidential burden on both limbs applicable to s 10.3(2)(b) – first, that the appellant believed that committing the offence was the only reasonable way to deal with the emergency; and second, that any such belief was reasonable.
	
	
	Her Honour seems to have taken a similar view with respect to s 10.3(2)(c). She made a similar finding:
	


“111  The accused has failed to discharge the evidential burden necessary to enable the defence under s 10.3 of the Code to be left to the jury for its consideration.”

In each case, the finding was based upon the availability of an appeal against the interim orders of 29 February; a secondary basis was the possibility of an urgent interim or interlocutory application to the Family Court.


	
	Woodburne DCJ identified the issues with respect to the defence provided by s 10.4 as follows:
	


“116  …

(i)  whether the evidence is capable of suggesting the reasonable possibility that the accused believed her conduct was necessary to defend the child and/or herself (s 10.4(2)(a) of the Code);

(2)  whether the evidence is capable of suggesting the reasonable possibility that the conduct was a reasonable response in the circumstances as the accused perceived them (s 10.4(2) of the Code);

(3)  whether the evidence is capable of suggesting the reasonable possibility that the accused was not responding to lawful conduct or did not know the conduct was lawful (s 10.4(4)(a) and (b) of the Code).”


	
	She found that the appellant had discharged the evidential burden with respect to s 10.4(2)(a), saying:
	


“121  I am satisfied that the evidence relied upon by the accused is capable of suggesting the reasonable possibility that the accused believed her conduct in taking her child from Australia to a place outside Australia was necessary in order to defend her son from harm.”


	
	However, she found that the appellant had failed to discharge the evidential burden in relation to the objective reasonableness of that response. She said:
	


“130  In circumstances where, as here, the accused had available to her a right of appeal against the interim order, which she chose not to exercise, as well as a right to be heard at any hearing of the application for parenting orders, together with a right of appeal from any such order, the extreme action of taking the child from Australia to a place overseas cannot be objectively viewed as anything other than a fundamentally unreasonable and disproportionate response to the circumstances as the accused perceived them to be.”


	
	She then reminded herself of the principles concerning withdrawal of defences from a jury, and went on to say:
	


“132  In circumstances where, however, the conduct is a fundamentally unreasonable and disproportionate response to the circumstances as the accused perceived them to be the evidence is not capable of raising and does not in fact suggest the reasonable possibility that the accused’s conduct was a reasonable response in the circumstances as she perceived them.”


	
	It may be accepted that the appellant’s evidence was sufficient to discharge the evidential burden with respect to the existence of an extraordinary emergency. The finding to that effect by the trial judge tends to mask the identification of what that perceived emergency was. As outlined by the appellant in the opening stages of the trial, the emergency that she perceived was a danger that either A or herself would be subjected to physical (not sexual) violence by Mr B. The danger existed because of the continuing contact visits between A and Mr B. Absent an order for contact visits, her fears would be allayed. Hence, it was the order for contact visits that created the emergency. It was an emergency because the appellant had no faith in the capacity (or motivation) of the relevant authorities in particular the Family Court of Australia to take steps to investigate or protect A.
	
	
	The defence provided by s 10.3 is based on the common law defence of necessity, although the language is borrowed from s 25 of the Criminal Code (Qld). The generally accepted test was stated in R v Loughnan [1981] VR 443, and adopted, with a modification, in R v Rogers (1996) 86 A Crim R 542. (A decision of this Court constituted by Gleeson CJ, Clarke JA and Ireland J). In Loughnan it was said:
	


“It will be seen … that there are three elements involved in the defence of necessity. First, the criminal act or acts must have been done only in order to avoid certain consequences which would have inflicted irreparable evil upon the accused or upon others whom he was bound to protect. The limits of this element are at present ill defined and where those limits should lie is a matter of debate …

The other two elements involved … can for convenience be given the labels, immediate peril and proportion, although the expression of what is embodied in those two elements will necessarily vary from one type of situation to another.

The element of imminent peril means that the accused must honestly believe on reasonable grounds that he was placed in a situation of imminent peril …

The element of proportion simply means that the acts done to avoid the imminent peril must not be out of proportion to the peril to be avoided. Put in another way, the test is: would a reasonable man in the position of the accused have considered that he had any alternative to doing what he did to avoid the peril?”


	
	In Rogers, Gleeson CJ, citing a decision of the Supreme Court of Canada (Perka v The Queen (1984) 14 CCC (3d) 385), said:
	


“Using the term ‘defence’ without any implications as to onus of proof, his Lordship pointed out (at 399) that it has been universally recognised that, if the defence of necessity is to have a place in the criminal law, it must be strictly controlled and scrupulously limited to situations that correspond to its underlying rationale.”

A little later, his Honour said:

“As with self-defence, considerations of reasonableness and proportionality are essential control mechanisms. Dickson J [in Perka] referred (at 400) to the ‘the requirement that the situation be urgent and the peril be imminent’, but in a context consistent with the approach that this is a factual matter of relevance to the contention that the breach of the law in question was, in practical terms, unavoidable.”

His Honour then said:

“The corollary of the notion that the defence of necessity exists to meet cases where the circumstances overwhelmingly impel disobedience to the law is that the law cannot leave people free to choose for themselves which laws they will obey, or to construct and apply their own set of values inconsistent with those implicit in the law. Nor can the law encourage juries to exercise a power to dispense with compliance with the law where they consider disobedience to be reasonable, on the ground that the conduct of an accused person serves some value higher than that implicit in the law which is disobeyed.

This is why, historically, it has been regarded as important to seek to limit the scope of the defence by referring to requirements such as urgency and immediacy. However, I accept the appellant’s submission that, consistently with the approach to self-defence taken by the High Court in Zecevic [Zecevic v Director of Public Prosecutions (Vic) [1987] HCA 26; 162 CLR 645], it is now more appropriate to treat those ‘requirements’, not as technical legal conditions for the existence of necessity, but as factual considerations relevant, and often critically relevant, to the issues of an accused person’s belief as to the position in which he or she is placed, and as to the reasonableness and proportionality of the response.”


	
	Notwithstanding the apparent complexity of the issues, the success of this ground (in relation to both proposed defences) boils down to one stark question: did the potential for appeal against the orders of 29 February, or the potential for a further urgent application in the Family Court, operate in such a way as to render any belief by the appellant that:
	



	
	removing A from Australia was the only reasonable way to deal with the emergency;
	
	
	that her conduct was a reasonable response to the emergency;
	
	
	that removing A from Australia was necessary to defend A;
	


incapable of being objectively reasonable? If not, then in my opinion, the appellant had discharged the slender evidential burden.


	
	The appellant’s evidence was that she believed that an appeal was unavailable to her, by reason of cost; but that she also believed, on the basis of advice given to her, that an appeal was highly unlikely to be successful. She said that she was not aware of, and had not given thought to, the possibility of a further application to the court.
	
	
	Inherent in the proposition that she was justified in removing A from Australia because an appeal would be unsuccessful is a distrust of the processes of the Family Court of Australia. To allow the defence to go to the jury on that basis would be for this Court to condone unlawful action arising out of that distrust. That is something that, in my opinion, this Court cannot, and should not, do.
	
	
	Similarly, the appellant’s perception of the unavailability of an appeal by reason of cost cannot be sustained. She had funds; she was working. True it is, an appeal in which she was legally represented would have caused financial hardship, but financial hardship does not meet the high test of the defence, as explained in Rogers.
	
	
	That there remained procedures available for the appellant, through proper channels, to protect both herself and A from the harm she apprehended renders the proposition that her beliefs were reasonable incapable of acceptance.
	
	
	The same reasoning produces the same result in relation to the proposed defence under s 10.4.
	
	
	For these reasons, I agree that Ground 1 of the appeal must be rejected.
	


Ground 2


	
	Ground 2 is framed as follows:
	


“2.  Her Honour erred in ruling that the question of whether [Mr B] sexually abused [A] was not relevant and therefore not to be considered in this trial. Her Honour erred in directing the jury not to consider whether [Mr B] did sexually abuse [A] and in directing me not to adduce evidence for that purpose.”


	
	I should state at the outset that if the “extraordinary emergency” that the appellant perceived was identified as a danger that A would or might be subjected to sexual abuse at the hands of Mr B, then, in my view, evidence of the truth of the allegations of sexual abuse would be relevant and admissible with respect to the reasonableness of the appellant’s beliefs (whatever they were found to be). But, as I have set out above, the risk of sexual abuse was not the extraordinary emergency that the appellant perceived. The extraordinary emergency that she perceived was the danger that A was, or she was, or both were, at risk of some other form of extreme physical violence at Mr B’s hands. The allegations of sexual abuse had some relevance to this, in the sense that the appellant’s evidence was that one of the reasons for her apprehension was that the complaints of sexual abuse exposed Mr B and provided him with a reason to take extreme action of the kind the appellant feared.
	
	
	In that respect, the fact that the allegations had been made was potentially relevant to the objective reasonableness of a belief that Mr B might take action of that kind. I do not discount the possibility that the truth of those allegations might have supported the evidence that the appellant’s belief was objectively reasonable, although it is becoming rather remote.
	
	
	I have set out above the relevant rulings made, at the end of the trial, by Woodburne DCJ. At an earlier stage, during the course of the appellant’s evidence, she gave the jury directions concerning an audio recording that was in evidence as Exhibit 42. She told the jury that the recording was not tendered for the purpose of establishing that, as a matter of fact, Mr B had committed any sexual misconduct towards A, and she added that the trial was not an inquiry into whether Mr B did or did not commit any such sexual misconduct. She warned the jury in firm terms that they “should not and indeed must not embark upon any such inquiry”. She gave a similar direction in relation to the audio visual recording of the interview with JIRT which was in evidence. These directions were consistent with the stance the appellant had taken at the commencement of the trial.
	
	
	In the discussions at the commencement of the trial, before the jury was empanelled, the appellant stated clearly that she did not want to have the jury “try and ascertain the sexual abuse issue”. She said the issue was very complex, the jury would not be able to make a determination, certainly not from Dr Waters’ report. She added that the sexual abuse was not the reason that she left the country. It was on that basis that the trial proceeded.
	
	
	Later, during the course of the trial, in relation to one of the exhibits, she repeated that she was not seeking to make use of it to prove sexual abuse.
	
	
	In those circumstances, there can be no substance in Ground 2. I would reject it.
	


Ground 3


	
	Ground 3 is framed as follows:
	


3.  Her Honour erred in failing to make findings on the admissibility of Dr Waters report and specifically its impact on any future Court proceeding and therefore my ability to succeed at an appeal or any application for parenting orders.”


	
	Dr Waters was called in the Crown case. His evidence in chief was brief. He gave evidence of his qualifications and expertise as a child psychiatrist. He said that he had received a request from the Family Court to act as “a single expert witness” for the Family Court proceedings. For that purpose he conducted interviews with the appellant and Mr B, in each case in the presence of A, as well as the appellant’s brother and his wife. He did not separately or directly interview A. He identified documentary material with which he had been provided for the purpose of his assessment. He wrote a report, which he identified and which was marked for identification 9.
	
	
	He said that he gave consideration to any “mental condition” which the appellant might have shown, linked to her allegations. He excluded two diagnoses (paranoid schizophrenia and paranoid state) and accepted the possibility that she had a condition of “overvalued idea” or “fixation with a particular world view”. He did not make any diagnosis to that effect.
	
	
	Dr Waters did say that he had found it difficult to conclude from the materials with which he had been provided that Mr B had molested A. He then recommended a reduction in the regime of contact visits. That was the conclusion of Dr Waters’ evidence in chief.
	
	
	In a discussion before Dr Waters was called, the Crown prosecutor made it clear that he did not propose to tender Dr Waters’ report. The appellant indicated that she proposed to cross-examine Dr Waters quite extensively. The Crown prosecutor then reserved his position on the tender of the report, pending that cross-examination. He did not at any time tender the report. Neither did the appellant.
	
	
	Accordingly, the short answer to this ground of appeal is that her Honour was never asked to rule on the admissibility of the report.
	
	
	In her written submissions the appellant said:
	


“138  Even if the Crown did not wish to rely on Dr Waters’ report, I wished to rely on its inadmissibility in my defence. I wish to show that Dr Waters’ opinion was inadmissible by law yet as I realised before departing Australia in 2008 it was going to be relied on to grant [Mr B] unsupervised contact with [A] (Ex: 46, 49). Dr Waters report denied me the possibility to protect [A] from the imminent risk of unlawful sexual abuse from [Mr B].

…

141  However I required her Honour to make legal rulings on the admissibility of the evidence according to expert witness law. The same Makita principles apply in the Family Court as in the District Court …”

(The reference to “Makita” is a reference to Makita (Australia) Pty Ltd v Sprowles [2001] NSWCA 305; 52 NSWLR 705.)


	
	In her written submissions, the appellant then went on to make many criticisms of Dr Waters, both personally, and as to his evidence. She attacked his credentials and his expertise.
	
	
	The transcript of the appeal hearing demonstrates the confusion that attends this ground of appeal. The presiding Judge suggested to the appellant that if the report had not been tendered, or tendered and not pressed, there would be no need for findings as to its admissibility. The appellant replied:
	


“I didn’t understand that[.] I assumed, I brought into evidence the conclusions and recommendations of Dr Waters’ report in cross-examining Dr Waters and I therefore assumed having adduced that he did not have the expertise and that his findings were unreliable. I assumed that was ample evidence to determine that this report for the purpose of deciding the risk to the child on sexual abuse just doesn’t legally meet the rules of expert law and he’s not able to write it anyway because he doesn’t have the expertise, so--”


	
	When pressed further by the presiding Judge, the appellant said:
	


“As a matter of law I believe her Honour erred, she made findings but she erred in not finding that Dr Waters simply should not have written a report on a child sexual abuse case, on this case because he didn’t have the expertise. He is not an expert and therefore that put my situation at risk … The Family Court are accepting bad reports and they have used Dr Waters on many occasions also beyond my case …” (italics added)


	
	The appellant then accepted that her complaint was that Woodburne DCJ should have found that Dr Waters was not an expert, and that therefore his evidence was not admissible in the trial. However, she added:
	


“… but that the likelihood was that they would rely on it because she swore in evidence that [Mr B’s lawyer], [the balance of this sentence is impossible to understand. The appellant went on to say] her Honour … didn’t state it in so direct terms but Dr Waters’ report added to my son’s risk greatly because it pretty much sealed his fate in that there was nothing I could do to stop him going to his father unsupervised given the report and I also adduced in evidence from cross-examining [the independent children’s lawyer] …


	
	The appellant was then asked if her real complaint was as to the admission of Dr Waters’ oral evidence. She did not accept this and said that the evidence was significant to show the risk she had in the Family Court proceedings, and that Dr Waters’ report would be used to place her son at risk. She was asked the same question again, and she answered:
	


“My objection is - no I want to admit his evidence in this trial to prove that he should not have written that report and how damning it was to have that evidence used in the Family Court.”


	
	She finally accepted a proposition put to her by Wilson J in the following terms:
	


“So is your complaint that her Honour didn’t conclude that Professor W was unreliable for the purposes of the Family Court proceedings?”


	
	Ultimately, it appeared to be the appellant’s position that Woodburne DCJ ought to have ruled that Dr Waters did not hold the relevant expertise for the purpose of giving evidence in the Family Court, but that the likelihood was that the Family Court would nevertheless have admitted the report, and Dr Waters’ evidence, and this supported her view that she would not have succeeded in an appeal or in an urgent interlocutory application.
	
	
	Plainly, Woodburne DCJ could not rule on the admissibility in Family Court proceedings of any report by Dr Waters. What the appellant now asserts that Woodburne DCJ ought to have done was to rule (i) that Dr Waters did not have the necessary expertise to give evidence (whether by way of report or orally) in the Family Court; (ii) that, nevertheless, the Family Court would have admitted Dr Waters’ evidence and; (iii) that the Family Court would have acted upon Dr Waters’ inadmissible opinion, to the detriment of herself and A.
	
	
	On this basis, she argued, the proposition that an alternative to taking A from Australia lay in her right of appeal did not counter the objective reasonableness of her beliefs and should be rejected.
	
	
	The argument is unsustainable. What it amounts to is an argument that the Family Court would have admitted evidence ruled in the District Court to be inadmissible. It would be quite wrong for Woodburne DCJ to have made such a finding.
	
	
	In any event, as I have said, the short answer to this ground of appeal is that no ruling of the kind the appellant now claims ought to have been made was ever called for. The appellant said in her oral argument, and in her written submissions, that she wanted Dr Waters’ evidence admitted in order (she said) to prove that he did not have the relevant expertise to provide the report. It is true that Woodburne DCJ did not make a definitive ruling on Dr Waters’ expertise, but that was because it was unnecessary to the issues raised in the proceedings.
	
	
	I would reject this ground of appeal.
	


The application for leave to appeal against sentence


	
	Although Woodburne DCJ dealt with the appellant under s 20(1)(a) of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth), and did not pass sentence, the definition of “sentence” in the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) is wide enough to encompass the order made.
	
	
	For the reasons given by Ward JA, I would grant leave to appeal against sentence, but dismiss the appeal.
	
	
	Accordingly, I agree with the orders proposed by Ward JA.
	
	
	WILSON J: I agree with the orders proposed by Ward JA, and with her Honour’s reasons.
	


APPENDIX TO WARD JA’s reasons

Summary of events pre and post December 2007

Note:  Where there is reference in this summary to matters that were included in the November affidavit but were not in evidence at the trial, they have been included in order to provide a comprehensive summary of Ms B’s submissions on this appeal.

Pre- December 2007

1.   Mr B and Ms B were married in August 2004. Their child was born shortly thereafter. From about 18 months, he was observed by Ms B and others to have a fear of being touched by other children (November affidavit at [2]-[3]; in evidence at trial via the reading of [66]-[68]; [81] of Family Court affidavit). (Ms B now considers that this indicates that her son was being abused from that age, although this is not a view that she expressed at the time she took her child out of the country (AB 5/917.35)). Ms B described occasions when her son would not settle well and would cling to her and scream if she tried to leave him at the crèche or with Mr B (November affidavit at [4]-[5]).

2.   Ms B returned to work part-time about a year after her son’s birth. By 2007, she was working four days a week as a senior product marketing manager. In that year, she went on three overseas business trips, leaving her son in the primary care of Mr B each time.

3.   Ms B says that on her return from the first of those business trips, in June 2007, her son said to her “Daddy was unkind to me” and that when she later enquired at a playcare centre which her son attended she was told that the word “unkind” was there used to teach children what behaviour was unacceptable. (February 2008 Family Court affidavit at [38]-[39], annexed to November affidavit). Ms B says that she did not interpret this statement at the time as a reference to sexual abuse and denied the suggestion put to her in cross-examination at the trial that the inclusion of this statement in her initial affidavit sworn on 21 February 2008 in respect of the Family Court proceedings (the February 2008 Family Court affidavit) indicated a link in her mind to the sexual abuse allegations (AB 5/907; 908).

4.   Ms B says that after her second business trip, in October 2007, her son started running up to her and ladies in the local shopping centre saying “You’ve got poo all over you” and that he continued this behaviour “intensely” for a few months (November affidavit at [13(b)]). She says that in October 2007 her son said to her “There’s something in my bottom, Mummy. Clean the inside, Mummy. Put your finger in” (November affidavit at [10]). Ms B says that her husband began leaving work early, collecting their son from day care and taking him for walks in the bush (a local nature park); and that on one such occasion she met them returning from the bush and their son had a lollipop (November affidavit at [8]; Family Court affidavit [165] read onto transcript at trial did not refer to seeing child with a lollipop). (Ms B later attached significance to the lollipop, having read of grooming behaviours by sex offenders that included the provision of lollies.)

5.   Ms B says that on her return from her third and final business trip, in November 2007, her son was: no longer sleeping through the night; coming in to her approximately two to three times a night; complaining that he did not like his bed; and asking to sleep with her (November affidavit at [13(d)]; reference to this at trial via Family Court affidavit [15] and T 681.25-32 on 31/11/13). Ms B says that her son increasingly displayed sexualised behaviours (see November affidavit at [14]).

6 December 2007

6.   What precipitated Ms B’s disclosure to the authorities of her concerns as to sexual abuse was an incident on 6 December 2007. Ms B says that her son said and did certain things that night, when her husband was not at home (including making gestures that Ms B believes simulated male masturbation and ejaculation) that Ms B considered revealed that Mr B had sexually abused their child and had engaged in adult sexual behaviour towards their child.

7.   In cross-examination at the trial, Ms B agreed that she had formed an unshakeable view on 6 December 2007 that her husband had sexually abused their child (AB 5/920.50-921.39); that she was absolutely sure that her husband was the abuser (AB 5/921.41); that there was no explanation for her son’s disclosure other than sexual abuse and that the father was the perpetrator, and that she saw no reason to doubt that (AB 5/937.38-45). Ms B agreed that she “absolutely” wanted Mr B to have no further contact at all with his son ever again because of what had happened (AB 5/973.15).

Report to the authorities

8.   Ms B reported her concerns the following day to her general practitioner, who referred the matter immediately to the police Child Protection Unit (CPU).

9.   A social worker from the CPU met with Ms B on 7 December 2007 and arranged an interview with the Joint Investigative Response Team (JIRT) on 10 December 2007. Ms B says that she was told by the social worker, among other things, not to tell her husband about the disclosure.

10.   Ms B gave evidence at the trial (AB 5/689) that the child protection social worker (whether at the meeting on 7 December 2007 or following the JIRT interview is unclear) said that:

…the legal system is not very good at dealing with children of this little age and that it’s very likely that he will get unsupervised time with his father.

(On its face, the receipt of such advice is hard to reconcile with Ms B’s evidence that she fully expected that when the matter came before the Family Court there would be an order for there to be no contact (between father and son) until the allegations were investigated (AB 5/936.50) but it may be that Ms B had discounted or not accepted the opinion of the social worker in that regard.)

11.   Ms B also gave evidence at the trial that the CPU social worker advised her that it would not be worth having her son physically examined as it had been more than 48 hours since her husband had any opportunity to be with him (AB 5/689). This may be a reference to advice given to Ms B over the telephone by a doctor who was contacted by the CPU case worker at the meeting on 7 December 2007 (AB 5/812). In her November affidavit, Ms B says that it was a doctor at the CPU who told her that a physical examination would be futile as DNA evidence would no longer be present (Family Court affidavit [155] that there was no point looking for DNA). Ms B appears to take issue with the fact that the doctor did not consider looking for physical damage such as anal scarring (November affidavit at [23(a)]), though by this stage it does not appear that Ms B had made any allegation as to the father putting his finger in the child’s bottom (that disclosure she says was made to her by her son on 30 February 2008 (AB 5/866)). Ms B gave evidence that that same doctor, when she later contacted her to say that her son was complaining of a sore bottom, simply advised her to apply Bepanthene cream (AB 5/812).

12.   On 10 December 2007, Ms B took her son to the JIRT appointment. She met with a detective constable and a DOCS caseworker. The DOCS caseworker, Ms McCluskey, interviewed the child in the absence of Ms B. That interview was recorded and the recording was admitted as Exhibit 41 at Ms B’s trial; a transcript of the interview is in the appeal books (AB 1/392; Exhibit 59 at the trial) and is an annexure to the November affidavit (Annexure P).

13.   Ms B’s evidence at the trial was that, after the JIRT interview, she was told that the child did not disclose any sexual abuse and that even if he had done so a judge would not accept it unless the child could prove he understood the concept of truth and lies. Ms B did not see the JIRT interview video until after her return to Australia, when it was subpoenaed for the purpose of the legal proceedings. Therefore, matters to which she now points on the recording (such as her son’s reference to “hurties” and his reluctance to acknowledge his father) could not have informed her state of mind at the relevant time. However, Ms B maintains that she knew at the time that the interview was inadequate.

14.   Ms B says that after the interview she was told the case would be suspended and it was suggested that she go to a community health service and seek some ongoing counselling for her son (AB 5/866).

15.   The CPU apparently decided to close the case on 11 December 2007 (file note at AB 1/228). The JIRT subsequently closed its case following an assessment consultation on 19 February 2008 (as recorded in a file note of 21 February 2008) (AB 1/230).

16.   In her November affidavit, Ms B deposes to her belief that Mr B knew about the meeting with the JIRT and had “managed to threaten” their child before the interview. She says that this was the only recording in which her son “did not speak spontaneously and resisted talking about his father” and that her son was tired and yawning during the interview (November affidavit at [22]; [27]). Ms B accepts that she had not at that stage told Mr B about the 6 December 2007 incident but believes that Mr B knew that their son had told her “something” and was focussed on finding out what that was (November affidavit at [27]). (It is not clear that this was a belief that Ms B had formed as at 10 December 2007 or even as at the time that she left the country. Given her reference to her son’s behaviour during the recording, it appears to be a construction that Ms B has later placed on events.)

17.   Ms B contacted a community health service, as had been advised by the JIRT, but says that they would not meet with her son (AB 5/866) because they were afraid the Family Court could accuse them of trying to solicit a disclosure. Ms B says that she also contacted a child advocates’ charity, and was given similar advice. In her February 2008 Family Court affidavit, parts of which were read out to the jury in the course of Ms B’s evidence in chief, Ms B lists the various professionals she consulted in December 2007 (at [157]).

18.   In her February 2008 Family Court affidavit (at [53]-[58]), Ms B deposes that she had attended a Women’s Legal Service on 21 December 2007 and that this step enabled her to establish contact with the solicitors that she ultimately “formally” instructed on 25 February 2008 (Musgrave Peach). However, she did not speak with a solicitor from that firm (Ms Lister) until the office reopened in January 2008, by which time she had already made her plans to leave Mr B.

19.   Ms B says that on 22 December 2007 Mr B disclosed to her, for the first time, that he had been on anti-depression medication for some time but that he had ceased taking the medication (November affidavit at [28]; corresponding evidence at [92] of Family Court affidavit read out at trial).

20.   Both Mr and Mrs B accept that there was a high level of tension in the home at that time. Ms B was apparently seeking to prevent her husband spending any time alone with their child in order to protect their child from abuse. Ms B had still not at this stage told Mr B of the statements and actions made by their child on 6 December 2007 or of her suspicions that he had sexually abused their child (see February 2008 Family Court affidavit at [60] which was read out at trial). However, she says that she told him on 22 December 2007 that her son had said that he had been “unkind” to him (February 2008 affidavit at [95], not read onto transcript at trial but was reference to “unkind” at T 687 31/10/13).

21.   Ms B consulted her general practitioner again on 24 December 2007 (AB 1/231); she again spoke with the JIRT on 27 December 2007 (AB 1/232); and she contacted the police around that time (November affidavit at [38]; T 690.2-6 31/10/13).

Ms B leaves matrimonial home with son

22.   Ms B left the matrimonial home with her son on 1 January 2008, without telling her husband that she did not intend to return. Her evidence at the trial was that she put some belongings in her car gradually over the week before she planned to leave her husband and waited until after New Year’s Eve to do so, in order not to disrupt the Christmas plans of her brother and his family with whom she stayed when she first left home (AB 5/725).

23.   Ms B returned to collect items from the house on three occasions: on 2 January 2008, 21 January 2008 and 29 January 2008 (February 2008 affidavit at [62], read out at trial). She says that on that last occasion, Mr B arrived while she was there and disclosed that he had suicidal intentions (Family Court affidavit at [62], T 727.26- 728.16, 1/11/13). In her November affidavit she says that she became extremely concerned that Mr B would kill all of them, although she did not give evidence of any statement by him that amounted to a threat to do so (November affidavit at [43]; not in evidence at trial). Ms B reported to DOCS the following day that her husband had disclosed suicidal intentions, but she did not apparently disclose any concern as to homicidal intentions.

Commencement of Family Court proceedings

24.   On 30 January 2008, Ms B wrote to her husband to confirm that their relationship was over and that she had no intention of any reconciliation (AB 1/82). A lawyer at Musgrave Peach, who first acted for her in the Family Court proceedings, had assisted her to draft that letter (AB 5/764).

25.   In her letter, Ms B wrote that her decision to end their relationship and discontinue any association with Mr B was “solely related to revelations made to me by [the child] over the course of a number of months, but in particular the evening of December 6th, 2007”. She wrote that the child had described to her what amounted to acts of adult sexual behaviour by her husband towards him that left her in no doubt that Mr B had been sexually abusing him; that she had been in regular contact with professionals in the area of child protection; that she wished to obtain a parenting order that the child live with her and that Mr B “have no further contact with him of any nature”; and that if Mr B did not consent to orders to that effect she would proceed with legal action and “utilise every avenue available” to secure the child’s safety and protection. The letter did not suggest that Ms B was seeking only a temporary order pending further investigation of the allegations.

26.   Mr B apparently then instructed solicitors to act for him. On 5 February 2008, Slade Manwaring wrote to Ms B noting that allegations of sexual abuse had been made (though, as noted above, details of the allegations had not yet been provided to Mr B by Ms B other than that her son had said in June 2007 that his father had been “unkind”); recording Mr B’s denial of having done anything of any nature that might be construed as abusive to his son; and advising that Mr B was willing to undertake an investigative process (of the kind that it was said would normally take place if allegations of this kind were made in the course of contested proceedings) in relation to Ms B’s concerns (AB 1/84).

27.   The letter went on to note that there were a number of specialist psychiatrists that performed those services regularly in Family Court cases in Sydney and identified three such psychiatrists, the third of whom was Dr Waters. The letter acknowledged that Ms B or her legal advisor might have another list of names from which a person could be chosen but suggested that, to get the matter started, Dr Waters be the nominated psychiatrist. A photocopy of his curriculum vitae was enclosed (AB 1/87) listing Dr Waters’ qualifications, past appointments and other matters. Ms B seems to have concluded, from the fact that Mr B’s lawyers had nominated Dr Waters, that he was “aligned” with her ex-husband.

28.   Musgrave Peach responded to Slade Manwaring on behalf of Ms B by letter dated 13 February 2008 (AB 1/91), advising that Ms B was prepared to instruct an expert by consent but that she wished to make it clear that her position was to seek orders that the child live with her and that there be no order made for the child to spend time with his father. In the letter, they further stated that Ms B did not agree to the child spending any time with Mr B pending the release of the expert’s report. Musgrave Peach said that they were making enquiries as to the availability and costs of appropriately qualified experts.

29.   Ms B’s instructions to her lawyers at this time were that she objected strongly to her son spending any time with his father “now or in the future” (AB 1/243) based on her concern that Mr B had exhibited extremely inappropriate sexual behaviour towards the child, that he might do so again and that contact between them might bring back fearful memories. Ms B informed her lawyers that she was extremely concerned for her son’s safety in Mr B’s care and emphasised her belief that a female expert should be appointed and that a male expert would be inappropriate. (Both experts nominated by Ms B’s lawyers are female; Dr Waters is male.)

30.   By letter dated 18 February 2008, (AB 1/108) Musgrave Peach notified Slade Manwaring that Ms B would consent to the appointment of one of two other psychiatrists, Dr Robinson or Professor Quadrio, as the single expert. Ms B says that she knew nothing about those psychiatrists at the time but that they had been recommended by her lawyers (AB 5/740). She now maintains that Dr Robinson is not an expert in child sexual abuse and that, had Dr Robinson been appointed, no better outcome in terms of a proper investigation of her allegations would have been obtained. (Dr Robinson, who was later appointed the Family Court expert after Ms B, following her return, challenged Dr Waters’ appointment, has since assessed Ms B as having a delusional disorder.)

31.   On 18 February 2008, Mr B filed an initiating application in the Family Court seeking both interim and final parenting orders, including an order for the child to live with each of his parents on alternate days and that Dr Waters be appointed as the Court’s expert (AB 1/43). That application was accompanied by a Notice of Child Abuse or Family Violence in which it was noted that Ms B alleged that Mr B had sexually abused the child. Although issue was later taken by Ms B at the trial as to the content of this notice, Mr B’s solicitor’s evidence was that he had prepared the notice based on his instructions from Mr B and that it was in standard form (AB 4/382).

32.   Ms B filed a response to Mr B’s Family Court application on 28 February 2008, seeking final orders that she have sole parental responsibility for the child and that the child live with her with no order being made for the child to spend time with the father. The application sought the appointment of Dr Robinson as the Court expert in the proceedings to enquire into and report to the Court on various matters including issues relating to any sexual or other abuse of the child (AB 1/115).

33.   On 29 February 2008, the proceedings came before the Family Court for the first time. Ms B was represented by a barrister and solicitor on that occasion and submissions were made by both parties. (Ms B is critical of her then barrister’s performance during these submissions and expressed scepticism as to whether the Family Court judge had “even read” her affidavit.)

34.   A parenting order was made, pending further order, (AB 1/130) pursuant to which provision was made for Mr B to spend time with his son at a supervised contact centre. The parties were ordered to comply with any appointments made by the contact centre for supervised time and to comply with all reasonable rules, requests or directions of the contact centre. Dr Waters was appointed as the single court expert to prepare a report in relation to the welfare of the child. Both parties were otherwise restrained from (without the leave of the Court) causing the child to be examined by a medical practitioner or other expert solely for the purpose of the proceedings. A non-publication order was also made on that occasion. (Ms B has since accused Mr B’s solicitor of misrepresenting to the Family Court matters in relation to Mr B’s application for the non-publication order.)

35.   Also on 29 February 2008, a solicitor, Mr Christos Christaki, was appointed by the Family Court to act as the independent children’s lawyer. (Ms B has also been critical of Mr Christaki’s conduct as the independent children’s lawyer. She cross-examined Mr Christaki at the trial on his role and duties as the independent children’s lawyer.)

36.   Ms B made it clear in her correspondence to her lawyers (AB 1/247) following the 29 February 2008 hearing that she was very distressed by the outcome of the Family Court proceedings and, in particular, with the making of the order for supervised contact. She believed (and is still firmly of the view) that contact between father and child was not appropriate until the allegations were investigated (see submissions on conviction appeal [12]). Her principal position, as stated in her early correspondence to Mr B, was that there should be no further contact at all between them. She gave evidence at the trial that she was upset about Dr Waters’ appointment because she had already read “concerning” things about him and felt that he was biased (AB 5/740).

Advice as to appeal prospects

37.   On 5 March 2008, a copy of which was not in evidence at the trial, Ms B’s lawyers gave advice as to the prospects of appeal from the orders of the Family Court.

38.   By email (AB 1/246) on 7 March 2008, Ms B advised her lawyer at Musgrave Peach, among other things, that: she could not afford to appeal the order for supervised time; she had already taken and accepted the advice of a barrister that it would be unlikely that an appeal would be successful; and therefore she would not appeal. In that email, Ms B also made reference to a “stay” of the orders, saying that she did not understand that terminology and therefore could not comment on that.

Ms B’s legal representation

39.   Musgrave Peach ceased to act for Ms B on about 10 March 2008. It appears that they formed the view that Ms B had lost confidence in their services. (Such a conclusion might readily have been drawn from the content of Ms B’s correspondence around that time.)

40.   On 7 March 2008, in a second email on that day to her lawyer, (AB 1/247) Ms B raised various matters as to the conduct of the proceedings. She referred to Musgrave Peach having told her not to seek support from any source other than the firm and made it clear that this would continue (i.e., that she would continue to seek other advice as she chose). Ms B’s evidence at the trial was that at around this time she had been contacting Rosie’s House, an organisation that deals with parents/children who have been abused and gives them counselling (AB 5/743); and had been in communication with a person from ChildWise (described as a charity advocating for children in Victoria) who had advised her to go to Cara House Counselling (AB 5/745). Whether or not this is the context in which advice was given by Musgrave Peach for Ms B not to seek support elsewhere is not clear.

41.   Ms B gave evidence that her lawyers had stopped meeting with her in person (AB 5/937.3) and that the next document she received (after her 7 March email as to the distressing outcome of the February hearing) was a letter from her lawyers saying that they had ceased to act for her. However, she then qualified this by saying that she thought she had also received a letter from her lawyers referring to a loss of confidence by her in their services (AB 5/774).

42.   By letter dated 10 March 2008 (AB 238) Musgrave Peach wrote to Mr B’s lawyers, Slade Manwaring, advising that they had ceased to act for Ms B and enclosing a copy of a notice of ceasing for their records.

43.   At around this time, Ms B complained to ChildWise that her lawyers had ceased to act for her on the eve of her interview with Dr Waters (AB 1/239) but said that she had been able to obtain some assistance prior to her interview with Dr Waters from a pro bono legal centre (AB 5/785).

Dr Waters’ interview

44.   On 11 March 2008, Dr Waters interviewed Mr B and Ms B, as well as Ms B’s brother and his wife. Ms B’s evidence was that she was not expecting a positive interview with Dr Waters because she had read an internet article by him that seemed extremely biased and she had read “",2015-05-21 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2703395,Brandon Trevor RICH v R [2015] NSWDC 71,"Judgment

Decision on the Conviction Appeal of Brandon Trevor James RICH


	
	Lord Hailsham observed in Boardman v DPP (1974) 60 Cr App R 165 at 176:
	


“However, the variety of human circumstances is infinite, and the fertility of ingenuity in counsel considerable…”


	
	By way of Notice of Appeal to the District Court Brandon Trevor James RICH appeals against a conviction recorded at the Dubbo Local Court on 16 May 2014 in respect of a charge that on 1 April 2014 at Dubbo in the State of New South Wales he did knowingly contravene a prohibition specified in an order, contrary to section 14(1) of the Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act 2007. The terms of the order are pleaded within the section titled “Details of Offence” on the Court Attendance Notice, but those are particulars only and do not impact on the charge. No submission is made to the contrary.
	
	
	It is appropriate in order to better understand the issues involved to set out a chronology. The information is drawn from the papers on the court file, the transcript of proceedings before the Local Court and the submissions of the parties.

	The proceedings before the Local Court on 16 May 2014 proceeded by the prosecutor handing to the court a brief of evidence and both parties made submissions.
	
	
	The appeal was mentioned a number of times before me at the Dubbo District Court on various dates between 23 June 2014 and 4 February 2015. The matter was adjourned as Mr Day, solicitor for the appellant indicated to the Court that he was waiting on advice as to whether some type of prerogative relief was to be sought in the Supreme Court of New South Wales. Eventually it was indicated to the court that that was not going to occur, and accordingly, the matter is being litigated in the District Court.
	


The appeal


	
	Mr Day, with his usual thoroughness has provided written submissions setting out the basis of the appeal. Essentially, as I understand the submissions, it is put that the Court would uphold the appeal on a number of bases, namely, there was no proof before the Local Court of the conduct said to be the contravention of the Apprehended Violence Order, that the prosecution were unable to prove service of the Provisional Apprehended Order on the appellant and, further, the learned Magistrate in the Local Court should not have informed himself of the events of 5 March 2014 (or for that matter anything else) from the Court papers, as that material was not part of the material tendered by the prosecution.
	
	
	The hearing before the learned magistrate was by way of the police prosecutor tendering a brief of evidence and submissions. The brief became exhibit 1 before the Local Court and consisted of a copy of the Provisional Order made at 3.25 am on 27 February 2014 indicating that the appellant was required to be at the Dubbo Local Court on 5 March 2014; an electronically generated Statement of Service completed by Senior Constable Bartlett indicating personal service at 4 am on 27 February 2014; and a copy of an interim order continued at the Dubbo Local Court on 26 March 2014, on which date the appellant was apparently not present in Court.
	
	
	Section 14 of the Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act provides:
	


14 Offence of contravening apprehended violence order 

(1) A person who knowingly contravenes a prohibition or restriction specified in an apprehended violence order made against the person is guilty of an offence. Maximum penalty: Imprisonment for 2 years or 50 penalty units, or both.

(2) A person is not guilty of an offence against subsection (1) unless:

(a) in the case of an apprehended violence order made by a court, the person was served with a copy of the order or was present in court when the order was made, or

(b) in any other case, the person was served with a copy of the apprehended violence order.

(3) A person is not guilty of an offence against subsection (1) if the contravention of the prohibition or restriction concerned:

(a) was necessary in order to attend mediation under section 21, or

(b) was done in compliance with the terms of a property recovery order.

(4) Unless the court otherwise orders, a person who is convicted of an offence against subsection (1) must be sentenced to a term of imprisonment if the act constituting the offence was an act of violence against a person.

(5) Subsection (4) does not apply if the person convicted was under 18 years of age at the time of the alleged offence.

(6) Where the court determines not to impose a sentence of imprisonment, it must give its reasons for not doing so.

(7) A person is not guilty of an offence of aiding, abetting, counselling or procuring the commission of an offence against subsection (1) if the person is a protected person under the order concerned.

(8) A police officer is to make a written record of the reasons for:

(a) a decision by the police officer not to initiate criminal proceedings against a person for an alleged contravention of subsection (1) or (9) (whether or not the person is arrested), or

(b) a decision by the police officer not to proceed with criminal proceedings against a person for an alleged contravention of subsection (1) or (9),

if the police officer or another police officer suspects on reasonable grounds that the person has committed an offence against either subsection or if an alleged contravention of either subsection by the person has been reported to the police officer or another police officer.

(9) A person who attempts to commit an offence against subsection (1) is guilty of an offence against that subsection and is punishable as if the offence attempted had been committed.


	
	Essentially Mr Day submits on behalf of the appellant is that the prosecution were unable to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant had been served with a copy of the Order or that he was in court at a time the Order was made.
	


Evidence concerning the alleged breach


	
	At pars 27, 28 and 29 of his submissions Mr Day says:
	


“It would appear that the agreed facts that set out the common assault were not tendered during the hearing (see Transcript 13). Thus, strictly speaking, there was no evidence tendered during the hearing that disclosed a breach of an AVO. If this submission is accepted, although not raised in the hearing, perhaps by oversight, the appellant has no case to answer in respect of the alleged contravention of the AVO.”


	
	Initially, I was of the view that this ground may have had some merit. However, Mr Waldmann the solicitor who appears for the DPP on the appeal submitted that the following appears at p 2 lines 13 – 19 inclusive:
	


“McKENZIE:   Your Honour I’m happy to state what the issue is in terms of the Court’s determination for the matter that there is no plea entered. The contravene charge, there’s a fact sheet in terms of the agreed facts of what has happened with the common assault. The only issue for the other sequence is the issue of knowledge about the existence of an application of a AVO at the time of the acts that are agreed to and in that regard I’m happy for the sergeant and I’m proposing that the sergeant—“    [The emphasis on the word “only” is mine.]


	
	It is also curious, given the issues that were ventilated on the appeal and the appearance of the appellant and Mr McKenzie on 5 March 2014 that Mr McKenzie used the words “the issue of knowledge” about the existence of the application.
	
	
	Mr Day initially submitted that there was no evidence before the court of the assault that is the act that is said to constitute the contravention of the Apprehended Violence Order. He eventually resiled from the submission relating to the lack of evidence of the breach.
	
	
	Section 18 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 provides:
	


18  - Appeals against conviction to be by way of rehearing on the evidence

(1) An appeal against conviction is to be by way of rehearing on the basis of evidence given in the original Local Court proceedings, except as provided by section 19.

(2) Fresh evidence may be given, but only by leave of the District Court which may be granted only if the Court is satisfied that it is in the interests of justice that the fresh evidence be given.

(3) The parties to an appeal are each entitled to be provided with one free copy of the transcripts of evidence relevant to the appeal and, if fresh evidence is given, one free copy of the transcript of the fresh evidence.


	
	The extract from page two of the transcript before the Local Court is part of the evidence that is before me on the appeal. The then legal representative of the appellant conceded all matters save and except for the issue, “of knowledge about the existence an application of an AVO at the time…” Clearly, given the concession by Mr McKenzie before the Magistrate, there can be no reasonable argument that the issue of evidence that constituted the breach was something that was subject of an “oversight”. I am firmly of the opinion that the concession made before the learned Magistrate is part of the evidence before the District Court on the hearing of the appeal. The prosecution were entitled to rely on that concession in the Local Court and likewise, the prosecution are entitled to rely on that same concession on the hearing of the appeal.
	
	
	On this issue, I note that at par 8 of his “Outline of Written Submissions” Mr Day says:
	


“The learned Magistrate was further informed that a plea of not guilty would be entered to the breach AVO charge and that the sole issue for determination was knowledge about the existence of the AVO”


	
	There was initially some argument on this point. I make no apologies for being rather robust with Mr Day in the circumstances. As indicated above, Mr Day eventually resiled from the submission. However, the submission should not have been made in the first place, as there was no merit to or basis for the submission.
	


Service of the Provisional Order made on 27 February 2014


	
	Mr Day submits that the electronically generated Statement of Service is inadmissible to prove service of the order that was made on 27 February 2014. Mr Day goes on to submit in his Outline of Written Submissions (paragraph 31) that this essentially because the document was “hearsay pursuant to s 59 Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) and no exception to the hearsay rule applied”.
	
	
	The electronically generated statement of service is part of the material contained within the Crown Tender Bundle Exhibit A on the appeal. That document is headed Statement of Service – Provisional Orders, Interim Orders and Final Orders and contains the following:
	


“I have served on Brandon Rich at 15 Merilba Street, Narromine, NSW, 2821 a copy of this Apprehended Violence Order – Provisional Order

At the time of service I explained the nature and effect of the documents to the person served.

BARTLETT Michelle Anne/Sen Constable Dubbo”.


	
	The Local Court as presently constituted was created by the Local Court Act, No. 93 of 2007. That Act was given Royal Assent on 13 December 2007 and commenced on 6 July 2009. Sections 25 and 26 of that Act provide:
	


25 Local Court Rule Committee 

(cf LCA 1982, sections 30 and 31)

(1) There is to be a Local Court Rule Committee.

(2) The Rule Committee is to consist of the following members:

(a) the Chief Magistrate,

(b) at least one and not more than 6 Magistrates (in addition to the Chief Magistrate) appointed by the Chief Magistrate,

(c) a barrister appointed by the Bar Council,

(d) a solicitor appointed by the Law Society Council,

(e) an officer of the Court appointed by the Chief Magistrate,

(f) a person appointed by the Director-General of the Attorney General’s Department,

(g) if the Minister thinks that it is appropriate to appoint a person as a member—a person appointed by the Minister,

(h) the additional member or members appointed in accordance with subsection (3) or (4), as the case requires.

(3) The Rule Committee, when exercising its functions in respect of matters relating to the jurisdiction referred to in section 9 (a) and (b), is to have an additional member, being a person appointed by the Chief Magistrate to represent consumer groups.

(4) The Rule Committee, when exercising its functions in respect of matters relating to the jurisdiction referred to in section 9 (c), is to have 3 additional members as follows:

(a) a person appointed by the Chief Magistrate on the nomination of the Director of Public Prosecutions,

(b) a person appointed by the Chief Magistrate on the nomination of the Legal Aid Commission,

(c) a police prosecutor admitted to the legal profession under the Legal Profession Act 2004 appointed by the Chief Magistrate on the nomination of the Commissioner of Police.

(5) Schedule 3 has effect in respect of the Rule Committee.

26 Rules generally 

(cf LCA 1982, section 28A)

(1) The Rule Committee may make rules, not inconsistent with this Act, for or with respect to any matter that is required or permitted to be prescribed by rules, or that is necessary or convenient to be prescribed by rules, in relation to the practice or procedure of the Local Court.

(2) In particular, the rules may make provision for or with respect to the following matters:

(a) the practice or procedure to be followed in criminal proceedings,

(b) the functions of registrars and other officers of the Court,

(c) the review of orders or decisions of registrars,

(d) any matter incidental to, or relating to, any such practice or procedure.

(3) A rule may be made under this Act in relation to any matter for which a rule-making power is conferred on the Court by or under any other Act or law.

See also sections 42 (Rules in civil jurisdiction) and 71 (Rules in application proceedings).


	
	Proceedings in respect of Apprehended Violence Orders are civil proceedings. Section 42 of the Local Court Act provides:
	


42 Rules in civil jurisdiction 

(cf LCA 1982, section 79)

(1) The rules may make provision for or with respect to the following matters relating to the civil jurisdiction of the Court:

(a) the practice and procedure in the Court and in proceedings before a registrar,

(b) the transfer of proceedings between the Small Claims Division and the General Division,

(c) the referral of matters to Community Justice Centres for mediation under the Community Justice Centres Act 1983 ,

(d) the functions of registrars,

(e) the filing and serving of notices under this Act,

(f) the times for doing any matter or thing for the purposes of this Part,

(g) the excusal of non-compliance with the rules,

(h) costs in relation to proceedings in the Court’s Small Claims Division,

(i) the manner of doing any matter or thing for the purposes of this Part.

(2) This section does not give power to make rules with respect to any matter relating to costs that is regulated by Division 11 of Part 3.2 of the Legal Profession Act 2004 .

(3) This section does not give power to make rules in terms inconsistent with those of the uniform rules under the Civil Procedure Act 2005 unless the uniform rules expressly permit rules under this section to be made in those terms.

(4) The rules made under this section may authorise or require the use of an ECM system established under clause 2 of Schedule 1 to the Electronic Transactions Act 2000 in relation to any proceedings in the Court in respect of which the use of such a system is authorised by an order in force under clause 3 of Schedule 1 to that Act.


	
	At par 32 of the Outline of Written Submissions Mr Day says:
	


“During the hearing, the appellant’s solicitor suggested that Rule 5.12 Local Court Rules may create an exception to the hearsay rule”.


	
	However, at par 34 of those same submissions he says:
	


“The appellant submits no such concession should have been made in the Local Court.”


	
	I merely observe it does not assist the efficient conduct of the court if submissions or concessions are made by a party before the Local Court and then another practitioner of the same firm or organisation appear on an appeal to the District Court and make contrary submissions or attempt to resile from the concessions made. In particular, given what I have already extracted from the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act it is tolerably plain that the intention of the Parliament is that appeals from the Local Court to the District Court are to be determined on the material before the Local Court unless there is leave to call further evidence. An appeal from the Local Court to the District Court should not be an appeal against forensic decisions made by another practitioner, particularly in circumstances where the same firm or organisation appeared in the court below.
	
	
	Sections 25, 26 and 41 of the Local Court Act provide for the creation of a Rules Committee and the making of rules. The Local Court Rules are created in accordance with those sections and provide inter alia for rules relating to practice and procedure. The service of documents is quintessentially something that is within the bounds and purview of Practice and Procedure.
	
	
	As the Crown correctly submits, r 5.1 of the Local Court Rules provides that Part 5 of the Rules applies to committal proceedings, summary proceedings and application proceedings. Proceedings relating to apprehended violence order are application proceedings. Further, as the Crown correctly submits, r 5.2 includes an “Application Notice” as an originating document.
	
	
	Again, as the Crown correctly submits, section 29 of the Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act provides that a Provisional Order (i.e. the order made on 27 February 2014) is taken for the purposes of the Act to be an application for an order under Pt 10, and s 31 of the Act requires personal service.
	
	
	Rule 5.12 of the Local Court Rules provides:
	


5.12 – Proof of service

(1) A person who serves a document issues in proceedings must complete a statement as to service of the document served

(2) The statement must include the following matters:

(a) The date service was effected,

(b) The method of service,

(c) The name address and occupation of the person serving the document,

(d) If the document was served personally, the person to whom it was delivered,

(e) If the document was served by post:

(i) The information (and the source of such information) the person relied on in obtaining the address to which it was posted, and

(ii) The time and place of posting

(f) If the document was served by facsimile:

(i) The information (and the source of such information) the person relied on in obtaining the facsimile number to which it was sent, and

(ii) The date on which advice confirming successful transmission of the document was received,

(g) If the document was served by electronic communication (other than facsimile):

(i) The information (and the source of the information) the person relied on in obtaining the email address to which it was sent, and

(ii) The date on which the email was sent.

3. A copy of the document must be attached to the statement or the statement must clearly identify the document.

4. The statement must be signed by the person serving the document and a witness to the signature.

5. In the case of a document served by a police officer or a public officer, the statement is not required to be signed.

6.   …

7.   …   

8.   …


	
	The Statement of Service which I have extracted above is not signed. However, r 5.12.5 clearly provides that if a police officer serves the document no signature is required. Mr Day for the appellant maintains that in any event the Statement of Service does not comply with the rules as the officer has not indicated her address in that the word “Dubbo” appears in the section of the form for the address. Police officers in giving oral evidence are only ever required to give their name rank and station. It is blatantly obvious from the Statement of Service that Constable Michelle Bartlett is attached to the Dubbo Police Station. In these circumstances, I am of the opinion that address is adequately stated.
	
	
	Further, s 66 of the Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act may well be relevant in that it provides:
	


66 - Irregularity 

(1) If, in or in connection with application proceedings or the commencement of application proceedings, there is a failure to comply with any requirement of this Act or the rules, the failure is to be treated as an irregularity and does not nullify the proceedings or any step taken in the proceedings, or any judgment, document or order in the proceedings.

(2) Subsection (1) applies to a failure to comply with a requirement relating to time, place, manner, form or content or any other failure.

(3) In the case of an irregularity, the court may, on terms, set aside wholly or in part the proceedings or any step taken in the proceedings or any document, judgment or order in the proceedings or exercise its powers under the rules to allow judgments and to make orders dealing with the proceedings generally.

(4) The court must not take action under subsection (3) on the application of a party unless that application is made within a reasonable time and before the party has taken any fresh step after becoming aware of the irregularity.


	
	The very purpose of service of any document on any person is to bring to their attention the proceedings to which the originating process relates. The legislation that establishes the Local Court of New South Wales in its present guise specifically provides for the making of rules relating to practice and procedure. So far as I can determine the Statement of Service to which Mr Day takes objection in this matter complies with the Rules.
	
	
	Mr Day in his submissions refers to section 257 of the Road Transport Act 2013. Subsection (1) of the Act provides:
	


257 - Certificate evidence 

(cf Gen Act, s 230)

A statement in a certificate purporting to have been issued by an Australian Authority, an Australian authorised officer or an Australian police officer that, at a specified time or during a specified period, any of the matters referred to in the Table is or was, or is or was not, the case is admissible in any proceedings and is prima facie evidence of the matters stated.


	
	A Table then follows. That provision relates to the facilitation of proof of matters in relation to which records are held or kept by the Roads and Maritime Services in relation to matters such as driver licences. The facilitation of proof of these matters is entirely different to the proof of service of originating process.
	
	
	A similar submission is made in respect of section 48 of the Weapons Prohibition Act 1998, which relevantly provides:
	


48 Evidence 

A certificate signed by the Commissioner (or by a person holding an office prescribed by the regulations) certifying any one or more of the following:

(a) that a specified person was or was not, on a day or during a specified period, the holder of a permit,

(b) that any permit was or was not, on a day or during a specified period, subject to specified conditions,

(c) that a specified person was or was not, on a specified day or during a specified period, subject to a weapons prohibition order,

(d) that a specified thing was or was not, on a specified date, approved,

(e) that a specified address was, on a specified date, the last address known to the Commissioner of a specified person,

is admissible in any proceedings under this Act and is prima facie evidence of the matters so certified.


	
	Again, this provision relates to facilitation of proof of records, and again, is different to the proof of service of originating process.
	
	
	I agree with the submissions by the Crown that the title of r 5.12, “Proof of Service” indicates that r  5.12 exists to serve the purpose of facilitating proof of service of the process.
	
	
	For these reasons, I do not reject the Statement of Service because it offends section 59 of the Evidence Act, 1995. Even if I am wrong on this aspect in the particular circumstances of this appeal it significant that the appellant on 5 March 2014 was in court and represented by a solicitor of the Aboriginal Legal Service, ie the same organisation which employs Mr Day. A separate issue on the appeal relates to the magistrate informing himself from the Court record.
	
	
	A submission is advanced on behalf of the appellant that I should exclude that part of the Statement of Service that says, “At the time of service, I explained the nature and effect of the documents to the person served”. For more abundant caution I exclude that part of the Statement of Service. However, s 14(2) of the Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act requires only that the defendant be in court or that he was served. The section does not require that the document be read and explained to him.
	
	
	While doing some research on this matter between the various mentions I noticed that the bench sheet from which the learned Magistrate informed himself was not with the materials. Without objection from Mr Day that bench sheet was made available. Apart from that, it is also plain from the transcript of the proceedings in the Local Court that the appellant was present in court on 5 March 2014 when the interim order was made. There is a very significant body of common law to the effect that any defect in service is overcome by an appearance in Court – see the commentary to Ritchie’s Uniform Civil Procedure NSW at 10.19.5 at p. 5914. This was drawn to the attention of the parties.
	
	
	One of the several authorities to which the learned editors of Ritchie refer is the decision of Secombe v Bate, exparte Bate (1888) 9 LR (NSW) 161. Darley CJ, Windeyer & Owen JJ agreeing said at 163:
	


“In this case it is not denied that the summon was in fact served upon defendant; but it is said that there was no proof of this before the Judge, and that as defendant did not appear, the Judge had, in the absence of such proof no power to go on with the case. The defendant was duly served, and instructed his attorney to appear and raise the question of jurisdiction, and the attorney having appeared and raised the question this seems to me to be a sufficient appearance within 22 Vic No. 18 s. 64, that is, an appearance which gets rid of the necessity for any proof of service of the summons. But even if this were not an appearance within the section, still it was in itself ample proof that defendant had been served…”


	
	In Oulton v Radcliffe (1874) LR 9 CP 189 Keating J said:
	


“…In this case the writ was duly issued, and service outside the county is only an irregularity, which is waived by the appearance of the defendant”


	
	Brett J (agreeing with Keating J) in that same decision said:
	


“…You cannot force him into the jurisdiction, but if he comes in, or appears, he waives the irregularity of which he has knowledge…”


	
	Skerman J in Pioneer Concrete (North Coast) Pty Limited v Bennett [1972] Qd R 544 held that a defendant may, although not served with process, waive the necessity for service and enter an appearance.
	
	
	Buchanan J (Moore & Conti JJ agreeing with brief additional comments) in De Robillard v Carver (2007) 159 FCR 38 said at [86]:
	


In light of his appearance at, and participation in, the hearing before the primary judge there is no substance in the contention that the appellant was not properly served with the creditor’s petition…”


	
	Reference is then made to the Rules of Court.    However, the decision accords with the earlier nineteenth century decisions, which do not appear to have been the subject of any doubt whatsoever ever since.
	
	
	There is another aspect that may render the argument relating to the service of Provisional order redundant. The Provisional Order had immediate effect from the time of service on 27 February 2014. Upon the learned Magistrate making an Interim Order on 5 March 2014 in the presence of the appellant and his solicitor the Provisional Order had no further effect. The Interim Order made on 5 March 2014 was in effect on and from that date and was continued at subsequent appearances before the Local Court.
	
	
	By virtue of section 24(1)(a) of the Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act an Interim Order remains in force until it is revoked. Accordingly, the Interim Order was in force as at 1 April 2014 when the offence of common assault was committed against the person named as the person in need of protection in that Interim Order.
	
	
	The appellant was in court, with a solicitor, on 5 March 2014 when the Interim Order was made by the Local Court. That is sufficient to eliminate any defence under s 14(2) of the Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act.
	


Magistrate informing himself from the Court record


	
	During the course of the hearing before the learned Magistrate he informed himself of what had occurred by reference to the bench papers. Those papers, which are now also before me (by consent) as part of the material on the appeal indicate that on 5 March 2014 Sgt Gumley appeared for the applicant (a police officer), the appellant appeared in person and that Mr McKenzie appeared for the defendant. Having been on the Local Court bench for almost seven years, I am well aware that the notation “I/P"" is the standard abbreviation used in the Local Court to note that the person appeared in person. I also note that on one of the occasions the matter was mentioned before me Mr Day acknowledged that the appellant did in fact appear in person on 5 March 2014.
	
	
	Section 144 of the Evidence Act, 1995 provides:
	


144 - Matters of common knowledge 

(1) Proof is not required about knowledge that is not reasonably open to question and is:

(a) common knowledge in the locality in which the proceeding is being held or generally, or

(b) capable of verification by reference to a document the authority of which cannot reasonably be questioned.

(2) The judge may acquire knowledge of that kind in any way the judge thinks fit.

(3) The court (including, if there is a jury, the jury) is to take knowledge of that kind into account.

(4) The judge is to give a party such opportunity to make submissions, and to refer to relevant information, relating to the acquiring or taking into account of knowledge of that kind as is necessary to ensure that the party is not unfairly prejudiced.


	
	The Magistrate was entitled to acquire knowledge of the kind to which subsection (1) of section 144 of the Evidence Act refers. It was capable of being verified by reference to a document, namely the bench sheets, the authority of which could not be reasonably questioned.
	
	
	The following exchange occurred between the learned Magistrate and Mr McKenzie on 16 May 2014 at p. 3 lines 20 and continuing:
	


McKENZIE: Your Honour it notes that the defendant wasn’t present in court

HIS HONOUR: On 5 March he was.

McKENZIE: On the evidence before your Honour on the copy of the interim AVO that’s served in the brief of evidence that your Honour has it says that there is an interim order made, it’s not a provisional order, and interim order and it says that the defendant was not present in court. My submission—

HIS HONOUR: I’ve got the court papers here I’ll show then to you Mr McKenzie. Did he come to court on 5 March 2014, yes or no?

McKENZIE: My submission your Honour is that the evidence—

HIS HONOUR: Yes or no?

McKENZIE: I can’t answer that question your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Well you appeared. I understand it was his Honour Magistrate McPherson, if he was in court on 5 March “interim order continued 19 March”.    On 19 March he was excused, adjourned 26 March. On 26 March he didn’t appear. “Interim Order to Continue”.

McKENZIE: I can only—

HIS HONOUR: How can you advance an argument that there’s not an order in existence.

McKENZIE: I don’t.

(to p 4)

HIS HONOUR: He’s aware of when he was here and you appeared.

McKENZIE: Your Honour I don’t advance an argument that a court proceeding didn’t occur or an interim order was made and I can only make submissions to your Honour as Mr Rich’s representative on the evidence before the Court.

HIS HONOUR: Well I’ve got the court record here.

McKENZIE: That not in the brief of evidence before the Court in my respectful submission your Honour and your Honour if it was there is no evidence before your Honour…”


	
	Mr McKenzie made further submissions in the same vein at pages 5 and 6 of the proceedings before the learned Magistrate. At p 5 commencing line 26 the following appears:
	


HIS HONOUR: What I don’t understand Mr McKenzie - and please explain the court file, and I’ve got a copy of it here in front of me - I’ve been informed by the court staff, he turned up on 5 March 2014 – Gumley either Ms or Mr, Prosecutor Sergeant Gumley appeared, it’s marked “In person” by the Magistrate, his Honour Magistrate McPherson. The lawyer is Mr McKenzie. I presume that’s you and it says “adjourned to 19 March interim order 13 not enter” et cetera. So an interim order is made on the court file. How can you possibly argue that (t)here is not an interim order in existence when he comes to court and an interim order is made in court?

McKENZIE: It’s not in evidence your Honour, that’s the argument.


	
	Mr McKenzie went on to submit at p 5 line 45 and continuing that the only material on which the court could make a decision was the police brief of evidence that had been made available. Curiously, Mr McKenzie never did answer what appears to me to be a very appropriate question as to whether he was present or not on 5 March 2014. I am left pondering how, if the defendant was not properly served, noting that the Provisional Order required an attendance at court on 5 March 2014, it is that he is present in court, with legal assistance on that date.
	
	
	On one of the several occasions this matter was mentioned I drew the attention of the parties to the decision of the High Court of Australia in Mead v Mead [2007] HCA 25. Gleeson CJ (Hayne, Callinan, Heydon and Crennan JJ agreeing) said at paragraph [9] – 11]:
	


“The key paragraphs in the reasons of the Full Court are pars 68 to 87. It is unnecessary to set them out. It is sufficient for present purposes to say that the majority in the Full Court took the view that, because communications between the present respondent and her solicitors were the subject of legal professional privilege, it was not open to the primary judge to draw an inference that she knew the terms and meaning of Rose J's order in circumstances where the evidence did not show either that she was in court when the order was made or that she had been served with a sealed copy of the order. Since the most likely source of the respondent's knowledge of the order was her solicitor, the majority appeared to think that drawing an inference that she knew of the order would in some way be inconsistent with legal professional privilege. There is no such inconsistency.

No question of legal professional privilege arose in the proceedings before Cohen J. Neither the respondent nor her solicitor gave evidence, nor was there any attempt on the part of the appellant to adduce any evidence about communications between the respondent and her solicitor. The rule relating to legal professional privilege does not prevent the drawing, from events and circumstances, of inferences about the knowledge of a party, even if the probable source of such knowledge is a privileged communication. It is a rule that precludes the adducing of evidence in certain circumstances, but it is a rule that had no bearing on the present case.

If, as Cohen J and May J concluded, the facts and circumstances of the case supported, indeed compelled, an inference that the respondent knew of, and understood the meaning of, the order made by Rose J, then the consideration that neither she nor her solicitor could have been obliged to reveal communications that passed between the two of them did not stand in the way of acting on the basis of such an inference.”


	
	The Chief Justice went on to say at par 14:
	


“Because the majority in the Full Court of the Family Court erroneously considered that the law relating to legal professional privilege was an impediment to the drawing by Cohen J of the inference that he drew, and by implication concluded that the law similarly precluded the Full Court from drawing any such influence, the parties to the appeal to the Full Court have not had a proper consideration of the first of the grounds of appeal to the Full Court, which was that Cohen J erred in concluding as a fact that the respondent was aware of the terms of the orders made by Rose J on 7 September 1999 and that the order had been made.”


	
	These statements by the High Court make it tolerably plain that it is open to a judicial officer to have reference to the court file in determining whether a party was aware of a court order. There is also the issue of the party being represented. It would be expected that a competent legal practitioner, who was present at court when an order was made against their client would explain the fact of and effect of an order made against their client.
	
	
	Given that the appellant and Mr McKenzie were both present in Court on 5 March 2014 it is difficult to perceive how any unfair prejudice could be occasioned by the court informing itself from its own court papers. In any event, the Magistrate made it plain he was informing himself from the court papers and Mr McKenzie had the opportunity to make submissions.
	


Conclusion


	
	For these reasons I am firmly of the opinion that there is no substance to any of the arguments raised on behalf of the appellant. Indeed, given the body of common law to which I have referred to the effect that an appearance overcomes any defect in service, s 144 of the Evidence Act, 1995 and the effect of the decision of the High Court in Mead v Mead I am firmly of the opinion that the appeal should be dismissed. Indeed, I am reminded of what was said by RA Hulme J in Hudson v R [2015] NSWCCA 64 at [20], namely:
	


“It is most unfortunate that these applications have been brought to the Court. Valuable legal aid, prosecution and court resources have been consumed but they are both completely devoid of merit”.


	
	In the same vein, RA Hulme J said in Dunks v R [2014] NSWCCA 134 at [52]:
	


“This case truly fits the description of an ‘armchair’ appeal, a description often used in a deprecating fashion when points never raised at trial are sought to be raised on appeal. The term was explained by Johnson J in Darwiche v R; El-Zeyat v R; Aouad v R; Osman v R [2011] NSWCCA 62 at [170] :

‘... where counsel not involved in the trial has gone through the record of the trial in minute detail looking for error or possible arguments without reference to the manner in which the trial was conducted: R v Fuge [2001] NSWCCA 208; 123 A Crim R 310 at 319-330 [40]-[45]; Ilioski v R [2006] NSWCCA 164 at [155].’”


	
	Although the points relating to service and the court informing itself from its own record were raised, the extract above is apposite given the concessions made in the Local Court about matters which became the subject of significant argument on the appeal, this is particularly so in circumstances where Mr Day sought leave to withdraw the appeal, which leave was refused.
	


Formal Order


	
	The appeal against conviction is dismissed. I will now hear counsel on the issue of sentence.

2703423,R v P [2015] NSWDC 262,"sentence


	
	HIS HONOUR: All offences involving child pornography are serious but some are clearly more serious than others. I have before me today a very grave example of the horrors which are associated with those who gain sexual gratification out of viewing images and videos which all right-thinking people would properly categorise as abhorrent.
	
	
	In this case the offender, P, downloaded and possessed child pornography involving approximately 1,000 children. Some of those children were subject to indignities, sadistic behaviour, torture, bestiality and abuse of the vilest kind. It is beyond comprehension as to how anybody could regard viewing that material as an attractive proposition.
	
	
	Even reading the descriptions of what was contained in the material that the offender possessed is disturbing. That anyone could view that material and not be revolted is difficult to understand but to obtain sexual gratification from it is, as I have just said, beyond comprehension. However the harm that arises from offences of this kind is not to be determined by looking at how revolting certain behaviours are, it is to be determined by considering the harm that offences such as these create and that harm is incalculable. Many children were harmed in the production of the material that the offender possessed. He, amongst others, creates a market for such material which is satisfied by others. Necessarily satisfying the demand of people like P involves grave harm upon many children. The sentence that I will ultimately impose upon P reflects this harm.
	
	
	P’s criminality extends beyond simply viewing child pornography as I will shortly explain. Matters came to the attention of the police when Australian Federal Police received a referral from police in another country alerting them to an investigation which they were carrying out which had revealed that an internet address in Australia had been used to access child pornography. Enquiries began. This was in February 2013. In September 2013 two further referrals were made from the foreign police force, thus the offender was discovered as being the person who had on three occasions used a carriage service to access child pornography. He now faces two charges relating to that activity and asks that I take into account a third when I sentence him for one of them.
	
	
	More importantly than explaining how it was that P came to the attention of police is an examination of what followed thereafter. Police went to P’s home. They were armed with a search warrant. P told police there was pornography on his computer and a USB storage device. He told police that there was child pornography which he had obtained from a peer to peer network. Police then began the laborious task of examining the various storage devices. They discovered something in the order of 7,000 images and videos containing child abuse material which the offender had downloaded over a period of about 18 months. Some of the material was worse than others. I have given anxious consideration as to whether I should, as I have done in the past, give examples of what was found on the storage devices. I find it necessary to do so despite the obvious distress which is involved in performing such an activity and the obvious possibility that my very descriptions will provide sexual pleasures to someone else. I will be as brief as I can.
	
	
	Let us begin with some of the file names. There is no question but that these file names are on occasions designed to attract people such as P. Words as “pre-teen”, ”rape”, “pre-teen licked by her dog”, “fucked by dad”, “spermed inside by her dog” are enough to indicate the sort of material at its worst which P downloaded.
	
	
	Then we have descriptions of what happened to these poor unfortunate children. Various sexual things were done to them. At times the children were clearly in distress, crying and screaming. One picture showed a female toddler, and I emphasise the word toddler, who was tied, gagged and hanging upside down with her legs spread and an object inserted in her vagina. Another video this time depicted a young female between 13 and 15 years of age with her hands tied behind her back being forced to perform oral sex on an adult male. The video continues with the adult male taking the girl’s clothes off, having penile/vaginal intercourse with her while physically holding her down. He forces her to perform oral sex on him, then puts her on the floor with her hands still tied behind her back and gags her before leaving the room. I think I have said enough.
	
	
	Sometimes those who would promote sexual activity involving children suggest that children are capable of enjoying sexual activity. Of course such thoughts are wrong in the extreme but many of the videos and images which P possessed were such that no one could suggest that there was anything enjoyable going on. Instead many of the children were tortured and subject to brutal sexual depravity. Many were harmed in the production of this material.
	
	
	I mentioned before that the offender went beyond simply possessing child abuse material. One of the storage devices discovered by police depicted a particular sexual act performed by P on his niece. There were four video files found on the offender’s iPhone. They ranged in duration from 53 minutes to one minute and 42 seconds. What they depicted was the offender sexually assaulting his niece who was asleep. It turns out that he was babysitting her and took advantage of her presence in his home to do what I am about to describe. He pulled down the back of her shorts and underpants, used the index finger of his right hand to rub her external genitals and then inserted his finger into them moving his finger in an up and down motion. This continued for about one minute. His niece was nine years old at the time. He of course was given the care of his niece on the assumption that he would protect her. He failed to protect her and instead breached the position of trust that he was placed in in an awful way.
	
	
	It is some comfort I suppose to learn that the offender’s niece did not wake up. I gather that to this day she remains unaware of what occurred to her. There remains however the possibility that in the future through some mischance she may learn of what the offender did. In order to do what I can to reduce that possibility I will order that when these remarks are published on the internet, as they will be, the offender will not be referred to by name. This is not done I emphasise as any favour to him. It is done so that as far as I can I can protect the innocent victim of his awful crime from any further harm.
	
	
	The charges that the offender now faces are numerous. I have already mentioned those of using a carriage service to access child pornography. He faces a charge of producing child abuse material, that relating to his use of his iPhone to video his abuse of his niece. He faces a charge of aggravated sexual intercourse with a child under ten years of age, that of course relating to the offender’s sexual abuse of his niece and he faces four charges of possessing child abuse material, they relating to four separate storage devices. One of those storage devices had only a single image of what is in the grand scheme of things a relatively less serious form of child abuse material but another contained an enormous proportion of images and videos in the worst possible category. Fully 95% of the images and videos found on the storage device covered by sequence 12, a particular laptop computer, contained images and videos at level 5 of the child exploitation tracking scheme categories.
	
	
	The offender pleaded guilty to these offences at the earliest opportunity. There is thus the utilitarian benefit to his pleas and he has assisted the course of justice by pleading guilty. For both the State and Federal offences I will impose a sentence of 25% less than it would otherwise have been. One of the offences carries with it a standard non-parole period. The offence of aggravated sexual intercourse with a child under ten carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for life and a standard non-parole period of 15 years. I have taken into account the maximum penalties for all offences and the standard non-parole period where appropriate in determining the appropriate sentence to impose upon this offender. My reasons for not imposing a standard non-parole period for the aggravated sexual assault matter are to be found in these remarks on sentence.
	
	
	Let me just say a few words about the objective gravity of that offence. Serious though it was that offence has to be considered in determining the appropriate penalty in the light of all other offences covered by s 66A(2) of the Crimes Act. It may be difficult for the victim’s parents to accept but it remains the case that there are more serious examples of offending covered by that section and of course the maximum penalty is reserved for the worst type of offending. In this case the penetration was limited, the child did not wake and the offender did not use any force or threat to do what he wanted to, instead he took advantage of her being asleep. The sentence that I will ultimately impose for the aggravated sexual intercourse matter has to be looked at with those circumstances in mind.
	
	
	The offender is now 40 years of age. He grew up in Young. He has siblings with whom he has had little to do in the past and clearly after this offence he will have less to do in the future. He told a psychologist that his father was very abusive and violent when intoxicated. His parents separated when he was about 15. He was cared for by his mother after that and had nothing to do with his father which did not distress him because of his father’s earlier violent behaviour.
	
	
	As he reached adulthood he saw less and less of his family. He describes one brother as being a bully, one sister lived in New Zealand and the remaining sister was his main support. It is of note that he has repaid the fact that his sister supported him by abusing her daughter. He left school at year 11. He was not subject to any sexual abuse as a child nor misconducted himself sexually during his schooling. He was an apprentice chef for a while. He lost work sometimes when he relocated and he was supported by Centrelink but in his mid- twenties he gained employment in child care. He was employed in a baby room for a few years and then became a room leader and finally was a pre-school teacher for ten years. There is no suggestion in the material before me that he has abused any of the children with whom he worked.
	
	
	A psychologist goes through the offender’s psycho/sexual history. The offender said that he was bisexual for a time but realised that he was homosexual after a failed relationship with a woman in his early thirties. After that he came out to his mother and siblings who were accepting of his sexual orientation. Unfortunately sexual problems which he had experienced from time to time recurred, apparently because things were less exciting in his homosexual encounters now that everyone knew that he was a homosexual. He began looking at what he described to the psychologist as weird porn including things which involved sadism and masochism. He then viewed child abuse material for the first time at around 35 years of age. He said that he began to look at deviant child abuse material “maybe for the shock factor”. This lack of empathy is very disturbing. He spent a great deal of his day viewing pornography, both adult and child abuse material. His deviant attractions were reinforced because he found he was able to orgasm more often when viewing deviant pornography. He told the psychologist that he was able to distance himself from an acknowledgment of the harm that the victims were experiencing because “they were pictures on a screen”. He was thus able to rationalise his behaviour that way.
	
	
	The psychologist said that P does not seem to have experienced mental illness in his life, however he is a solitary and isolated individual who has little interest in personal relationships. As is common in such cases, the psychologist attempted to predict the risk of P’s future offending. Of course while such predictions may say something when populations of offenders are considered they have less to say about the likelihood that a particular individual will offend in the future. In this case I regard his prospects of rehabilitation as being guarded . His solicitor, in suggesting the unlikelihood of further offending, relied primarily on the consequences for him of having been detected as having offended in the way he has. His life has fallen apart said Ms Key and, he faces significant punishment for what he did which hopefully will act as a deterrent to him.
	
	
	The offender is entitled to have his otherwise good character taken into account. The Crown in her written submissions suggested that s 21A(5A) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 applied but withdrew that submission after considering a recent decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in which a judge who applied that section, admittedly in a dissimilar situation, was found to be in error.
	
	
	These are the offender’s first offences, I will take that into account in his favour.
	
	
	It is possible that the offender will serve at least some of his sentence on protection and it is possible that as part of that his conditions of custody will be more onerous than they would be in the general prison population. I have taken both of those possibilities into account as well.
	
	
	There has to be a substantial component of general deterrence built into the sentence that I will shortly announce. The internet has brought many wonderful advances, that it has allowed people like P to demand child abuse material be produced, which in turn has led to evil people creating such material. The statement of facts suggests that it is not terribly hard to gain access to such material, and to store it, to view it, and as in this case, on one particular occasion, to act upon it. That offences such as this are easy to commit and there are apparently a significant number of people willing to commit them, requires a sentence where general deterrence is given significant weight.
	
	
	There is a degree of overlap in some of the offences.. For example the three offences of using carriage service to access child pornography relate to material which was presumably then stored by the offender and is covered by the offences of possessing child abuse material. For that reason I will impose sentences upon the Commonwealth offences which are concurrent with sentences upon the State offence. The child abuse material which the offender produced of course relates to another offence committed by him that of aggravated sexual intercourse on his niece. I have taken into account that overlap in determining the overall sentence to impose upon the offender. I have also applied principles of totality.
	
	
	The sentence that I impose is as follows:
	
	
	For the Commonwealth offences of using a carriage service to access child pornography I impose concurrent sentences of one year fixed term of imprisonment to date from 8 April 2014. For the offence of possess child abuse material, sequence 18, I deal with the matter under s 10A of the Crime (Sentencing Procedure) Act, that is he is convicted with no further penalty. For the remaining offences I will impose an aggregate sentence. For the offence of possessing child abuse material, sequence 12, I would have imposed a sentence of imprisonment of five years. For the offence of aggravated sexual intercourse with a child, I would have imposed a sentence of imprisonment of three years with a non-parole period of two years. For the offence of producing child abuse material sequence 5 I would have imposed a sentence of one year and on each of sequences 11, 15 and 10 possessing child abuse material I would have imposed sentences of four years.
	
	
	I will impose an aggregate sentence of nine years with a non-parole period of six years nine months to date from 8 April 2014, thus the non-parole period expires on 7 January 2021. I have not made a finding of special circumstances in the offender’s favour for two reasons, I consider that the non-parole period is the minimum period which he should spend in custody, given his offending and the period of eligibility for parole will be sufficient in any case.

	HOEBEN CJ at CL: I agree with the careful analysis of the facts by Adams J in his judgment and I also agree with his Honour’s finding that the primary judge erred in the respects which Adams J has identified.
	
	
	Regrettably, I differ from Adams J in the result which he has come to. Because error has been identified, it is necessary for me to independently exercise my discretion pursuant to s6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) as to whether another and in this case a lesser sentence is warranted in law.
	
	
	The approach to be followed by this Court in such circumstances is set out in Kentwell v The Queen [2014] HCA 37 where the plurality (French CJ, Hayne, Bell and Keane JJ) said:
	


“42   … When a judge acts upon wrong principle, allows extraneous or irrelevant matters to guide or affect the determination, mistakes the facts or does not take into account some material consideration, the Court of Criminal Appeal does not assess whether and to what degree the error influenced the outcome. The discretion in such a case has miscarried and it is the duty of the Court of Criminal Appeal to exercise the discretion afresh taking into account the purposes of sentencing and the factors that the Sentencing Act, and any other Act or rule of law, require or permit. As sentencing is a discretionary judgment that does not yield a single correct result, it follows that a range of sentences in a given case may be said to be ""warranted in law"". A sentence that happens to be within the range but that has been imposed as the result of a legally flawed determination is not ""warranted in law"" unless, in the exercise of its independent discretion, the Court of Criminal Appeal determines that it is the appropriate sentence for the offender and the offence. …

43   After having identified specific error of the kind described in House, the Court of Criminal Appeal may conclude, taking into account all relevant matters, including evidence of events that have occurred since the sentence hearing, that a lesser sentence is the appropriate sentence for the offender and the offence. This is a conclusion that that lesser sentence is warranted in law. The result of the Court of Criminal Appeal's independent exercise of discretion may be the conclusion that the same sentence or a greater sentence is the appropriate sentence. In neither case is the Court required to re-sentence. …”


	
	On the facts of this case in the exercise of my discretion, I am not satisfied that a lesser sentence is warranted in law. Accordingly, the orders which I propose are that leave to appeal against sentence be granted but that the appeal be dismissed.
	
	
	ADAMS J:
	


Introduction


	
	On 13 December 2012 the applicant was sentenced on two counts of sexual intercourse without consent in circumstances of aggravation, namely that the victim was under the age of sixteen years, contrary to s 61J of the Crimes Act 1900, carrying a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment and the standard non-parole period of 10 years. After allowing a 25% discount for his early pleas of guilty, the applicant was sentenced, on each count, to concurrent terms of imprisonment of 6 years with non-parole periods of 3 years commencing 7 December 2012. It follows that the commencing point for these sentences was 8 years imprisonment. The applicant seeks leave to appeal against his sentences upon two grounds –
	


Ground 1: His Honour erred in the assessment of the objective seriousness of the offending.

Ground 2: His Honour erred in only extending limited leniency in consequence of the applicant’s absence of a criminal record and his prior good character.

Facts


	
	The following account is largely taken from a Statement of Agreed Facts which was adopted by the sentencing Judge and summarised in his reasons for sentence. On the evening of 27 December 2011 the victim, aged 15 years, and two female friends went by taxi to a camping and swimming area about 20km from Cowra. They met three teenage boys whom they knew. Also present was the applicant, then aged 26, who was the older brother of one of the boys. The victim did not know the applicant but recognised him from having previously seen him around town. Some of the males had taken casks of wine to the beach. The victim, who was drunk when she arrived, continued to drink. She did not see the applicant drinking alcohol at any stage. About an hour after they arrived, the victim’s two female companions were collected by family members and driven home. The victim and the four males sat around a camp fire on the beach near the water, at one stage the victim going for a swim. After some time, the victim and one of the teenage males began to hug and kiss but the victim began to feel sick and dizzy and moved to the tent to lie down. Her vision was blurry and she tripped over things. She lay on her stomach inside the tent. The applicant approached and said to her words to the effect, “If you pass out I’ll have to kiss you”. The victim said, “I’m not going to pass out”, got out of the tent and returned to the campfire. Still feeling sick, she crawled away and vomited into the sand. Sometime later the applicant said to the victim, “If you and [N] have sex we have to watch”. She replied, “Get lost” and made her way back to the tent and lay down, feeling very dizzy. The applicant again approached the tent and said, “I’m going to have to kiss you”. The victim said she missed her mum and wanted to go home. The applicant said he would take her home. He helped her from the tent to his vehicle, supporting her weight as he helped her enter, the victim having her arm around his neck. She fell in and out of sleep. She recalled arriving at a house which was not hers and believed was the applicant’s. The applicant stopped the vehicle and helped the victim to alight by taking her arm, putting it around his neck and supporting her weight as she walked. The victim did not understand what was happening and asked, “Am I going home?” She was highly intoxicated.
	
	
	The applicant placed the victim on a bed in a dark room and told her she needed to sober up or else her mother would get really angry. He removed all her wet clothing, including underpants and brassiere. The victim was very drowsy and did not say anything. The applicant left the room and placed the clothes in a dryer. The victim rolled herself up in a blanket, a short time later, beginning to feel sick and needing to vomit. The applicant took her to a bathroom and held her hair back as she vomited into the toilet. She then returned to the room and lay on the bed.
	


Count 1:


	
	The applicant returned to the bedroom and rolled the victim, who had passed out, onto her back. He tried to kiss her. The victim said that she wanted to sleep, the applicant said she could “in a second”. He then inserted his fingers into her vagina, pushing them in and out causing some pain. She told him to stop and said, “Get…away from me”. The applicant asked, “Do you like it?” She replied, “No”. The applicant nevertheless repeated his action, using his thumb very roughly and painfully.
	


Count 2:


	
	The applicant got on top of the victim, put his penis into her vagina and one hand on her left breast. The victim unsuccessfully tried to push him away. She said that this “hurt really bad” and yelled at the applicant to get off her. He asked, “Don’t you like this?” Again, she said, “No”. The applicant then pushed his penis into her vagina, causing more pain. The victim said he was really rough. She began to cry. The applicant said he knew he had a big penis. After some time he stopped and got off the victim, who was unsure whether he had ejaculated or not. He retrieved the victim’s clothes from the dryer.
	
	
	The victim dressed and the applicant walked her to his vehicle. She told him to drive her to the end of her street. She was crying and the applicant asked what was wrong. She did not reply. The applicant dropped her at the end of her street and said words to the effect, “Don’t tell anyone. It will be our secret”. The victim ran home and went straight to bed. A short time later, in the early hours of 28 December 2011, she was woken by a friend and her mother and told them briefly what had happened. Police were informed and she was taken to hospital and examined by a doctor. There were two fresh tears in the vagina measuring 1.5 and 3cm and very tender to touch. There was also tenderness to the muscles of the upper inner thighs.
	
	
	On 5 January 2012 the victim was interviewed by Police who, on 8 March 2012 attended the work address of the applicant and arrested him. He admitted meeting the victim at the beach and giving her a lift home, knowing that she was 15 years of age. He said she was very intoxicated and stumbling. He denied taking her anywhere but to her home, in particular that she came to his house. He denied sexual intercourse or any sexual connection with her. A buccal swab was collected and he was released without charge pending the results of the DNA testing. On 26 March 2012 Police were informed that DNA recovered from the high vaginal swab taken from the victim had the same profile as the applicant’s DNA. On the following day he was again arrested. He declined to be interviewed.
	
	
	So far as the objective circumstances are concerned, the sentencing judge said –
	


These crimes are unfortunately prevalent and very serious and youth must be protected from predatory persons and themselves, when they put themselves into dangerous situations. This protection must be to the maximum. The offender, by his conduct at the campsite, indicated in my view, predatory behaviour and embarked upon a journey knowing what his intentions were. On the objective side, I regard these offences as being above the middle of any scale constructed for such offences and must result in a prison sentence.

Subjective features


	
	The applicant had no criminal record. Ms Young, a specialist psychologist with the Community Offenders Service took a history, which was in a report tendered to the Court. Briefly, the applicant had grown up with his mother and four younger siblings, having had no contact with his father since he was sixteen. He said he is close to most of the family except his father. He completed High School, at the end of year 10, during which time he had been suspended three times. He had a number of jobs but was unemployed since March 2012. He was married but that relationship ceased. The applicant had a daughter from a brief relationship when he was 19. She was six years of age in 2012 but the applicant had no contact with her although he paid child support, the girl’s mother not wanting him to have contact. He had another relationship which ended in October 2011. The separation came as a major surprise and the applicant was suicidal for a period and very depressed. Ms Young confirmed this history in a telephone conversation with the clinical psychologist he had consulted. An Apprehended Domestic Violence Order was made in March 2012 in relation to his wife because of his continuing attempts to contact her. The applicant reported that he did not use drugs and, though he drank to excess while he was younger, now only has one or two drinks socially.
	
	
	It seems clear that the applicant had suffered quite a serious depressive illness following his separation and was placed on anti-depressant medication which he was taking at the time of the offence and, indeed, up to the time he was interviewed by Ms Young.
	
	
	So far as the Risk Assessment was concerned Ms Young said that he fell into “the moderate low risk category for sexual reoffending and, should he continue to manage his emotional state and not place himself into situations where he is around teenage girls in vulnerable situations, then this risk will be reduced”.
	
	
	The applicant gave evidence in the proceedings. He was employed at that time and still on medication for his depression. He said that he “totally feels disgusted for what I have done” and “totally feels sorry for [the victim] knowing she’s got to go through this trauma for the rest of her life possibly. If I could turn back time and take back things, if I could I would”. He denied he acted as “a predator … just watching this young girl drink herself to oblivion till she got to a certain stage where you could take advantage of her”.
	
	
	Amongst other things, the applicant’s mother confirmed the major emotional consequences for the applicant of the marriage break up, including his becoming suicidal. A friend of the applicant also gave evidence that the actions stated in the Agreed Facts of the applicant were not at all like him and that he had always been respectful to women so far as she had observed. The Captain of the Local Volunteer Rural Fire Service also gave evidence on the applicant’s behalf. The applicant was a member of his brigade. He had a high opinion of the applicant’s character. He also became very concerned about the applicant’s mental health in November and December of 2012 and believed that he was suicidal. Much the same evidence was given by the Deputy Captain of the fire brigade with which the applicant served. All these witnesses considered that the applicant’s conduct was contrary to his character as they knew it to be.
	
	
	Ms Anna Robilliard provided a report following a consultation with the applicant in early October 2012. Amongst other things, he told Ms Robilliard that he could not remember taking the victim to his home or having sexual intercourse with her although he accepted that DNA evidence proved that he did so and that he was responsible for the offences. Despite this lack of memory of the offences, he expressed disgust for his behaviour. Ms Robilliard warned against assuming that the applicant’s denial was deliberate and conscious since such behaviour –
	


“ … is often a defence mechanism that allows the person to reduce distance between their actions and their attitudes condemning such behaviour…[and in] some instances it may also be motivated by the fears of how their offending behaviour would be judged by both themselves and others”.


	
	As the sentencing judge noted, Ms Robilliard did not suggest any connection between the (accepted) emotional and psychological state from which the applicant was suffering at the time of the offence and the offending behaviour itself. His Honour said, as to this matter –
	


I can only come to the view that the breakdown of the marriage has caused the offender significant psychological reaction and this is either allowed previously controlled weakness to rise to the surface or is causative. Ms Robilliard, whose views I accept as I do Ms Young’s, does not espouse such breakdown was causative. However, it did no doubt play a significant role in the commission of the offences.


	
	As to the evidence of the applicant’s good character, his Honour said –
	


The offender has no criminal convictions and, hence, limited leniency may be extended, and I say limited leniency because frequently these types of offences are committed by persons with little or no convictions.

His Honour accepted, as I read his reasons, that this evidence together with that of remorse and contrition, justified the conclusion that the applicant had good prospects of rehabilitation with little likelihood of reoffending. These factors, together with the fact that this would be his first time in prison, his psychiatric condition and need for psychological assistance comprised special circumstances justifying a variation of the statutory ratio between the parole period and the overall sentence.

Submissions


	
	As to the first ground of appeal, Mr Barrow of counsel for the applicant submitted that the final sentence of the sentencing judge’s discussion of the objective seriousness of the offences (set out in the passage quoted above) is a clear reference to the measure of seriousness to which the standard non-parole period applies. Mr Barrow pointed out that the circumstance of aggravation particularised in the two charges was that the victim was under 16 years of age – in fact, she was just over 15 years and 6 months of age – at the time of the offences. It is important, he submitted, to take into account that this circumstance of aggravation would encompass a like offence committed against a child who had just turned 10 years of age, a manifestly far graver offence, all other things being equal. Mr Barrow pointed to the limited number of other aggravating circumstances. Thus although the victim was vulnerable by reason of her intoxication, it is clear that this was self-induced, the applicant not having made the alcohol available to her and not having encouraged her to drink. Whilst the offending was predatory, there was limited planning. There were no threats or violence except for that involved in the rough nature of the intercourse itself. There was no degrading or humiliating conduct aside from that inherent in the sexual acts themselves. On the other hand, Mr Barrow conceded that the applicant clearly breached the trust placed in him by the complainant in accompanying him from the campsite. Mr Barrow therefore submitted that it was not open to the sentencing judge to conclude that the offending conduct fell above the middle of the range of objective seriousness for this particular offence. Mr Barrow accepted the applicability to his submission of the following statement (frequently repeated) from the judgment of Spigelman CJ in Mulato v R [2006] NSWCCA 282 –
	


[37] Characterisation of the degree of objective seriousness of an offence is classically within the role of the sentencing judge in performing the task of finding facts and drawing inferences from those facts. This Court is very slow to determine such matters for itself or to set aside the judgment made by a first instance judge exercising a broadly based discretion. The question must be whether or not the particular characterisation which her Honour gave to the circumstances of the offence was open to her Honour. In my opinion it was open, although I have some hesitation in deciding so and find it to be at the lower end of the range which could reasonably be held to be so characterised.

It follows that, to succeed on this ground, it is not enough to persuade this Court that the offences in question might reasonably be regarded as less than the middle of the range of objective seriousness: it is necessary to establish that such a view was not reasonably open.


	
	For its part, the Crown submitted that the victim was vulnerable by the degree of her intoxication, the offences involve a breach of trust, the applicant did not desist despite the victim’s protests, the criminal activity was planned, even if only opportunistically and caused injuries to the victim. It was further submitted by the Crown that, given that the starting point for the sentence was 8 years which (absent special circumstances) would result in a non-parole period of 6 years or only 60% of the standard non-parole period of 10 years, the judge’s reference to the “scale constructed for such offences” may rather have been a reference to sexual assaults perpetrated on young intoxicated victims rather than to the standard non-parole period.
	
	
	In respect of Count 2, Mr Barrow relied on s 21A(3)(e) and (f) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 which provide that a lack of prior convictions and the fact that the offender was previously a person of good character are mitigating factors to be taken into account in determining the appropriate sentence. He pointed out that the sentencing judge accorded the offender’s clear criminal record only limited leniency because “frequently these types of offences are committed by persons with little or no convictions”. Although his Honour referred to the fact that the applicant had no criminal record as well as being a person of good character (the latter a fact his Honour appears to have accepted) his Honour did not refer to the latter factor as mitigatory. Mr Barrow took the Court to the following passage from Ryan v R (2001) 206 CLR 267; [2001] HCA 21, where McHugh J observed –
	


[23] It is necessary to distinguish between the two logically distinct stages concerning the use of character in the sentencing process. First, it is necessary to determine whether the offender is of otherwise good character. When considering this issue, the sentencing judge must not consider the offences for which the prisoner is being sentenced. Because that is so, many sentencing judges refer to the offender's ""previous"" or ""otherwise"" good character …

[25] Second, if the offender is of otherwise good character, it is necessary to determine the weight that must be given to that mitigating factor. If an offender is of otherwise good character, then the sentencing judge is bound to take that into account in the sentence that he or she imposes. The weight that must be given to the prisoner's otherwise good character will vary according to all of the circumstances.


	
	So far as the sentencing reasons for according the applicants clear record as justifying only “limited leniency” Mr Barrow cited Weininger v R [2003] HCA 14; 212 CLR 629 where Kirby J observed –
	


[58] The terms of par (m) also make it clear that ""character"" and ""antecedents"" are viewed by the Parliament, as by the common law, as separate considerations. Each of them is relevant to sentencing. ""Antecedents"" refers to any past criminal conviction, agreed or proved. Of course, past criminal convictions may also be relevant to a court's assessment of the ""character"" of the person being sentenced. However, for a very long time, the absence (or existence) of prior convictions and the fact that a person is a first offender have been regarded as separate and special considerations in sentencing. The absence of prior convictions (quite apart from issues of character) will usually attract more lenient punishment. In part, it recognises the fact that a first offender's lapse may be treated as exceptional, atypical and out of character. In part, it also reflects the experience of the criminal justice system that many of those who come before courts for sentencing are repeat offenders who, for that reason, must be treated more seriously because they have been repeatedly shown to be in breach of the law and have repeatedly obliged the mobilisation of the agencies established by society to defend it from crime.

[59] A first offender may, or may not, otherwise have a good character. He or she may simply have been lucky in not having been apprehended before. But this fact does not justify disregard for the separate consideration of a first offender's status as such, apart from any consideration of the character of that offender. The express differentiation between the two concepts in s 16A(2)(m) makes this point abundantly plain.


	
	In sum, Mr Barrow submitted that the applicant’s good character combined with his lack of prior convictions demonstrated that the offences were out of character and should be seen as an aberration by a person who is likely to be persuaded from further criminality by a relatively lenient sentence. It is submitted that the sentencing judge minimised the significance of these factors, although his Honour took the applicant’s character into account when dealing with the prospects of rehabilitation for the purpose of considering the question of special circumstances.
	
	
	The Crown’s submissions as to the second ground of appeal noted that the sentencing judge referred to the fact that the applicant had no previous convictions and evidentially accepted the evidence of his otherwise good character, submitting that what weight should be given to these considerations was a matter for discretionary evaluation with which this Court will not lightly interfere. The Crown submitted that there was nothing in the reasons given by his Honour which suggested that he did not give adequate consideration to these factors and accord them appropriate weight or, to put it more accurately, this Court would not find that his Honour erred when dealing with these aspects of the evidence.
	


Consideration


	
	If the sentencing judge’s reference to the “constructed” scale is to be taken as a reference to the standard non-parole period – which is the only meaning it is capable of bearing – I consider, with respect, that it was not reasonably open for his Honour to conclude that the offences were above the middle of the range of objective seriousness. The matters identified by his Honour for increasing the seriousness of the offence beyond the middle of the range were that these crimes are prevalent and very serious, the need to protect young persons from predators as well as from themselves when they put themselves into dangerous situations, that the applicant had acted in a predatory way and offered the victim a lift intending to sexually interfere with her. There is no doubt that the offences were serious but it is necessary to consider the range of conduct comprehended by s 61J of the Crimes Act. In my view there was nothing in the facts that took this case above the middle of the range of objective seriousness.
	
	
	It follows that his Honour erred in respect of this matter. Since the standard non-parole period is a significant marker to be applied to the setting of a sentence, this error cannot be regarded as merely technical and, unless this Court were satisfied that it did not in the result influence his Honour’s sentence, it must result in the quashing of the sentence if a lesser sentence is warranted in law. As pointed out above, the Crown submitted that the sentence and non-parole period actually imposed by the sentencing judge is so markedly at odds with finding that the objective seriousness of the offence exceeded the middle of the range that the Court should infer the error had not actually affected the outcome. I agree that there is a marked disparity between his Honour’s finding as to seriousness and the sentence itself. The difficulty with this analysis is that the ultimate sentence reflects also, of course, the relevant subjective features to which his Honour gave significant emphasis. In the result, I do not think it is appropriate to disregard his Honour’s conclusion about the level of objective seriousness and infer that he ignored it when setting the sentence. Accordingly, a patent material error has been demonstrated.
	
	
	So far as the extent of leniency appropriate to be extended because the applicant had no prior criminal record is concerned, I am also satisfied, with respect, his Honour erred. Of course the extent of leniency afforded a first time offender must depend upon the circumstances of the offence and the other relevant features of the case. In some cases the leniency which would otherwise be afforded might be limited by the fact that the lack of prior criminal history is a factor in the ability of the offender to commit the offence, as with drug couriers for example. Together with otherwise good character, it might provide an opportunity for a sexual predator to take advantage of his position (say, as a cleric or a teacher) to commit offences on children in their care although, even in these cases, it is not entirely irrelevant. The mere fact, as it seems to me, that particular offences may frequently be committed by persons with no prior convictions, cannot mean that the leniency otherwise to be afforded should be limited by that fact. All offenders are first offenders at one time. It does not appear whether his Honour’s view of this matter significantly affected the ultimate sentence but it is fair to infer, given his Honour’s language, that it had some effect. Given my conclusion in respect of the assessment of objective seriousness, it is not necessary to determine whether this error was sufficiently material to require the sentence to be quashed.
	
	
	The last matter requiring consideration is the treatment by the judge of the uncontested evidence of good character. It is not controversial that his Honour was bound to take this into account when fixing the sentence. Here as his Honour noted, there was abundant evidence that, aside from the particular offences for which he was being sentenced, the applicant was well thought of in the community and his good character went much further than the mere fact that he had no criminal convictions on his record. The evidence of Mr Waters and Mr Star, both of whom worked with the applicant in the Rural Fire Service, established that the applicant excelled in this very substantial commitment of serving the community. Furthermore, both these senior officers of the Fire Service and the other witnesses, who knew the applicant well, deposed to his character generally, in particular, that the offences were an aberration and completely inconsistent with the character of the applicant as they knew it. However, although recording that the applicant had no criminal associates, had a very good work record and was held in high regard, his Honour referred to his being of good character only in the context of his prospects for rehabilitation. In respect of possibly according the applicant leniency, his Honour referred only to his clear criminal record, and made no reference to his good character in this regard. On a careful reading of his Honour’s reasons, I am satisfied that his Honour confined the relevance of character to the issue of rehabilitation in the context of special circumstances and did not give the applicant full credit for this important element of his subjective case.
	


Conclusion


	
	It is necessary for this Court to reconsider the sentences under appeal in accordance with s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW). So far as the head sentence is concerned, having regard to all the circumstances (sufficiently set out in the body of this judgment) I propose that the starting point for the sentence on each offence should be 7 years. Deducting 25% for the appellant’s early plea yields a head sentence of 5 years and 3 months (rounded down slightly). In respect of the non-parole period, I would accept the findings of the sentencing judge as to special circumstances and thus vary the ratio stipulated by s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW). However, applying the same percentage as did his Honour would result in a non-parole period which, to my mind, would be “unreasonably disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of the offence” (vide s 23(3) of the Sentencing Procedure Act). Put otherwise, a lesser non-parole period than that which was imposed by the sentencing judge is not warranted. Accordingly I propose the following orders:
	



	
	Leave to appeal granted.
	
	
	Appeal upheld.
	
	
	On each count the applicant is sentenced to a term of imprisonment for 5 years and 2 months comprising a non-parole period of 3 years commencing on 7 December 2012 and expiring on 6 December 2015 with a balance of term of 2 years and 2 months expiring on 6 February 2018.
	



	
	McCALLUM J: I have had the benefit of reading the judgment of Adams J and the separate judgment of the Chief Judge at Common Law. With great respect to their Honours, I do not agree that the sentencing decision entailed error.
	
	
	Ground 1 asserts error in the assessment of the objective seriousness of the offending. The offences to which the applicant pleaded guilty were offences of sexual intercourse without consent in circumstances of aggravation, contrary to s 61J of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). The circumstance of aggravation was that the victim was under the age of 16 years: s 61J(2)(d). The Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) specifies a standard non-parole period of 10 years for an offence under s 61J, representing the non-parole period for “an offence [under that section] that, taking into account only the objective factors affecting the relative seriousness of that offence, is in the middle of the range of seriousness”: s 54A(2).
	
	
	The argument in support of ground 1 focuses on that provision and is based on the following remarks of the sentencing judge:
	


On the objective side, I regard these offences as being above the middle of any scale constructed for such offences and must result in a prison sentence.


	
	The applicant argued that, by those remarks, the judge was to be understood to be “attempting to comply with the requirement that there be an assessment of objective seriousness as part of the process of using the nominated standard non-parole period as a guidepost towards an appropriate sentence”. Justice Adams, with whom Hoeben CJ at CL agrees on this issue, has approached his consideration of this ground on that premise, concluding that the sentencing judge’s reference to a “constructed” scale is to be taken as a reference to the standard non-parole period.
	
	
	Before considering that issue, it is instructive to consider the legal context in which the sentencing judge’s remarks were made. Prior to the decision of the High Court in Muldrock v R [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120, the operative provision relating to standard non-parole periods (s 54B(2)) provided:
	


When determining the sentence for the offence, the court is to set the standard non-parole period as the non-parole period for the offence unless the court determines that there are reasons for setting a non-parole period that is longer or shorter than the standard non-parole period.


	
	That provision had been understood to state, in mandatory terms, a requirement which constrained the sentencing discretion in setting the non-parole period for an offence for which a standard non-parole period was prescribed. In order to comply with the perceived mandate, it was understood that the court had first to determine whether there any reasons for not imposing the standard non-parole period. To that end, the court was required to measure the objective seriousness of the offence against the construct of an abstract offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness (thus taking a two-stage approach, starting at the standard non-parole period and then determining how far and in which direction to move away from it in the particular case).
	
	
	On that understanding, this Court had held in a number of cases that, in the case of an offence carrying a standard non-parole period, the sentencing judge was required to make a specific finding as to where the offence fell in the range of offending covered by the section and that failure to do so amounted to error. The relevant authorities are summarised in the judgment of Simpson J in McEvoy v R [2010] NSWSC 110 at [69] to [85]; Grove J and R A Hulme J agreeing at [1] and [116] respectively. Her Honour did not express unqualified support for that line of jurisprudence, saying at [86]:
	


Although I perceive some practical difficulties in the application of these strictures, it is not for this Court as presently constituted to depart from considered principles stated and accepted by previous Benches. Counsel for the Crown was unable to specify just what application of these decisions would involve.


	
	The decision in McEvoy thus endorsed (at [86]) the requirement for a sentencing judge at least to indicate:
	


that a particular offence was significantly above or below mid-range, slightly above or below mid-range, or at the top or bottom of the range.


	
	Justice Simpson’s reservations were vindicated. In Muldrock, the High Court held that a standard non-parole period should not be treated as having determinative significance but operates rather as a legislative guidepost, standing as one of the many relevant factors to which the sentencing court must have regard. On that basis, the High Court held that, when sentencing for an offence that carries a standard non-parole period, the court is not required to make an assessment of whether the offence was within the midrange of objective seriousness (Muldrock at [25]); nor is it required to classify the objective seriousness of the offending (Muldrock at [29]). The sentencing court’s task is, rather, as described by McHugh J in Markarian v R [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at [51]:
	


The judge identifies all the factors that are relevant to the sentence, discusses their significance and then makes a value judgment as to what is the appropriate sentence given all the factors of the case.


	
	The decision in Muldrock roundly rejected the two-stage approach. It is clear from that decision that failure to make a specific finding as to where the offence falls in the range of offending covered by the section can no longer be regarded as amounting to error in itself. It remains, of course, a critical aspect of the sentencing task in every case, whether or not a standard non-parole period applies, for the court to make an assessment of the objective seriousness of the offending for which the offender stands to be punished. What emerges from Muldrock, however, is that it is not necessary to articulate such an assessment by reference to the hypothetical scale of offending covered by the offence, let alone to attempt to do so with the exacting precision required by the authorities considered in McEvoy.
	
	
	Section 54B(2) was amended after the decision in Muldrock to reflect the principles stated by the High Court in that case, now providing:
	


The standard non-parole period for an offence is a matter to be taken into account by a court in determining the appropriate sentence for an offender, without limiting the matters that are otherwise required or permitted to be taken into account in determining the appropriate sentence for an offender.


	
	It remains permissible (but unnecessary) to record a finding as to objective seriousness expressed by reference to the hypothetical scale of offending covered by the section. Such a finding reflects the sentencing judge’s evaluative judgment of one of the factors relevant to the sentence. Assuming adherence to the principles stated in Muldrock, this evaluative judgment cannot be understood to indicate a starting point in fixing the non-parole period.
	
	
	A ground of appeal asserting error in the expression of such an evaluative judgment faces a number of difficulties. The first is the narrow significance of the concept comprehended in such a finding. As explained in Muldrock at [27], meaningful content cannot be given to a finding as to where an offence falls in the range of offending covered by the relevant section by taking into account the circumstances of the offender. The High Court explained that the concept of an offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness is to be determined wholly by reference to the nature of the offending (a concept now reflected in the statute).
	
	
	Secondly, if error is to be discerned, there must be some clarity as to the range of offending under consideration by the sentencing judge. That is the principal difficulty in the present case. Section 61J of the Crimes Act specifies nine potential circumstances of aggravation. According to the principles approved (with some reservation) in McEvoy, had the sentencing judge intended to make a finding as to objective seriousness by reference to the whole range of offending covered by that section, he ought to have done so having regard to all of the various circumstances of aggravation contemplated. In that event, different considerations would arise. The range of possible conduct within each kind of aggravation and among their many possible combinations is considerable. But it must be recalled that, in accordance with Muldrock, there was no obligation to make such a finding.
	
	
	In any event, I do not think that is what his Honour meant. Rather, I apprehend his Honour meant no more than to record his view that the offences were above whatever might be hypothesised as the middle of the range of sexual assaults on victims under the age of 16.
	
	
	That emerges from the passage in the remarks on sentence in which his Honour introduced his assessment of objective seriousness, as follows (at 7.2):
	


The objective case is a very strong crown case, indicating a serious predatory attitude by the offender. I have regard to the ingredients of the offence, being the age of the victim, only fifteen, her obvious signs of intoxication, her placing of trust in the offender, in that he indicated he would drive her home, and the age and sobriety of the offender.


	
	The impression that the judge was considering only s 61J(2)(d) at that point is reinforced by his generic reference to offences of the kind he described as “prevalent” and the need to protect young people who put themselves into dangerous situations (set out in the judgment of Adams J).
	
	
	On the premise that his Honour was expressing a view as to the relative seriousness of these offences only by reference to other offences under s 61J(2)(d) (sexual intercourse without consent where the circumstance of aggravation is the fact that the victim was under 16), his Honour’s finding may readily be understood. I would note, in that context, that I read the decision in Muldrock as discouragement to precisely this kind of technical analysis or excessive refinement of the task of sentencing judges.
	
	
	Finally, there can be no single, correct finding as to where an offence falls in the range of offending covered by the relevant section. Where a sentencing judge chooses to express a finding on that issue, it may only be impugned if it was not reasonably open, having regard only to the objective nature of the offending (not the circumstances of the offender).
	
	
	Assuming his Honour meant no more than to say that each offence was above midrange for an offence contrary to s 61J(2)(d), I am not persuaded that the finding was not open. Leaving aside the circumstance of aggravation, the applicant engaged in the predatory behaviour of waiting and watching while a girl at a beach at night, whose friends had gone home, became so intoxicated as to be completely vulnerable. In my respectful opinion, the fact that her state of intoxication was self-induced is wholly irrelevant. Having observed her to become increasingly vulnerable, the applicant preyed on her vulnerability by offering her the safety of a lift home, as she clearly wanted. Instead, he betrayed her trust by taking her to his home and, while she was in a state in which she was unable to fend off his assault, he committed two acts of sexual intercourse without consent which were painful and caused injury.
	
	
	The circumstance of aggravation was that the victim was under the age of 16 years. I accept that the fact that she was 15 rather than, say, 5 or 10 is significant and reduces the seriousness of the aggravating factor to a degree, but that is not the only element of the offences and it does not derogate from the otherwise serious nature of the offending.
	
	
	While reasonable minds might differ as to the assessment of objective seriousness in those circumstances, I am not persuaded that the conclusion reached by the sentencing judge was not open.
	
	
	It is clear from the sentences imposed that his Honour gave considerable weight to the applicant’s subjective circumstances. Accordingly, ground 2 must also fail, in my view.
	
	
	For those reasons, I agree with the orders proposed by Hoeben CJ at CL, albeit not for the reasons his Honour has stated.

		12 May 2015",2015-05-11 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2703456,Workcover Authority of New South Wales v JML Tree Services Pty Ltd [2015] NSWDC 253,"Judgment


	
	JML Tree Services Pty Limited (the offender) has pleaded guilty to an offence that as a person conducting a business or undertaking who had a health and safety duty under section 19(1) Work Health and Safety Act 2011 (the Act), failed to comply with that duty and thereby exposed Nathan Bard, an employee of the offender, to a risk of death or serious injury contrary to section 32 of the Act.
	
	
	The maximum penalty for the offence is a fine of $1.5 million.
	
	
	On the sentence hearing, Mr Scott appeared for the prosecutor and Mr Nagle appeared for the offender.
	


Facts


	
	The parties presented an Agreed Statement of Facts, which can be summarised as follows.
	
	
	The offender conducted a business as an arborist and offered services including tree pruning and removal from residential sites.
	
	
	On 12 June 2013 the offender was engaged by the owners of residential property at 6605 Illawarra Highway Moss Vale (the premises) to remove 2 eucalyptus trees.
	
	
	Three employees of the offender attended the premises to complete the work, being Jeremy Long, Mr Bard and Simon McEwan. Mr Long was the sole director of the offender and was responsible for the supervision of the work on the day of the incident. Mr Bard had been employed by the offender as a Senior Groundsman since 1 May 2013. Mr McEwan was new to the industry and was working with Mr Bard for the first time on 12 June 2013.
	
	
	One of the eucalyptus trees to be removed was approximately 15 m high. The men removed all of the branches of the tree until only the trunk was left. At that time the tree was approximately 10 m high.
	
	
	The branches of the tree that had been removed were being fed into a Bandit Wood Chipper model 1590 XPD (the wood chipper). The wood chipper had been towed to the premises on a trailer by an Isuzu truck and it was set up so that the woodchips would feed into utility tray of the truck.
	
	
	The wood chipper had an in-feed chute, the base of which was a feed table. Branches were placed on the feed table and feed wheels inside the in-feed chute pulled them into the wood chipper. The wood chipper was designed so that the ends of longer pieces were placed onto the feed table. The feed wheels would draw the rest of the branch into the chute to be chipped. If there were shorter pieces or twigs, these were placed on top of the longer pieces so that they could be dragged into the machine. The feed wheels had a minimum gap of 15 mm between them. The feed wheels travelled at approximately 200 km/h when engaged.
	
	
	In order to remove the trunk of the eucalypt, Mr Long tied a 15mm diameter guide rope around the trunk to be used to pull it away from a nearby building when the trunk was cut. Mr Bard was holding the guide rope and standing about 1 to 2m from the wood chipper with his back to it, in amongst branches waiting to be fed into the wood chipper.
	
	
	Mr Long cut a scarf in the tree using a chainsaw. He saw where Mr Bard was standing as he was taking up the slack of the rope. Mr Long did not instruct Mr Bard to move from where he was standing.
	
	
	Mr Bard threw the slack of the rope behind him. The rope became entangled in the branches and was pulled into the wood chipper. This caused the rope to become instantly taut. The rope struck Mr Bard in the neck and he was flung in the air for about 1 m and then fell the ground. Mr Bard suffered a deep laceration to the neck and died at the scene.
	
	
	The wood chipper’s Operating and Parts Manual contained the following relevant warnings:
	



	
	that an operator should always stand to the side of the in-feed chute and remain within easy reach of the control devices;
	
	
	that an operator should take care to avoid becoming entangled in the vines or branches being fed into the wood chipper;
	
	
	that vegetation such as vines should be cut into 4 to 5 foot lengths away from the wood chipper and that the feeder system should not be used when feeding cut vines into the wood chipper; and
	
	
	care should be taken to prevent loose clothing, long hair, short sleeves or shirt tails from coming into contact with the feeder system.
	



	
	Mr Long informed WorkCover that as part of the wood chipper induction and work practices Mr Bard had been warned to ensure that the rope did not become entangled in the feeder system of the wood chipper. Mr Long did not provide general safety instructions to employees each day as to how to undertake their regular duties.
	
	
	On 12 June 2013:
	



	
	Mr Bard was not warned that he should ensure the rope did not become entangled in the chipper and was not told how to place the rope to avoid that occurring;
	
	
	Mr Long did not require the wood chipper to be moved into a position so that the rope could not become entangled;
	
	
	Mr Long saw the location in which Mr Bard was standing and did not instruct him:
	



	
	to move; or
	
	
	to move the wood chipper; or
	
	
	to deactivate the wood chipper while they were felling the tree;
	



	
	the offender had no written safe work method statement (SWMS) for the task being undertaken.
	



	
	After the incident the offender reviewed its SWMS and other documented systems as well as imposing an exclusion zone around the in-feed chute of the wood chipper when it was operating and implementing a new risk assessment procedure.
	


The offender’s evidence


	
	The offender relied on an Affidavit of Jeremy Long sworn 1 May 2015 and an Affidavit of Graham Meredith sworn 1 May 2015.
	
	
	Mr Long is the sole director of the offender, which he established on 20 January 2010. Prior to that Mr Long worked for Active Tree Services for a period of about 11 years. Mr Long annexed various certificates of competency and qualifications that he holds relating to his work.
	
	
	The offender is a small family-owned company in which Mr Long and his wife work. Mr Meredith is Mr Long’s uncle and he undertakes the bookkeeping and accounting tasks related to the business.
	
	
	Prior to the incident the offender employed up to 15 employees on a daily basis, including some subcontractors. At the date of the sentence hearing the offender had 5 full-time employees, including Mr Long and his wife, 1 part-time employee and 3 casual employees.
	
	
	Mr Long deposed that he had deliberately reduced the undertaking of the business after the incident from 5 crews to 2 crews working on any day, to allow him to better supervise the work. The second crew does not undertake tree felling work but is subcontracted to Active Tree Services to assist with cleaning up sites after felling occurs.
	
	
	Prior to the incident the offender had in place a number of safety systems and Mr Long recognised that safety was “the paramount concern on all sites”. The offender had engaged QAS Systems in March 2013 to review the offender’s safety systems and to make any changes deemed necessary.
	
	
	After the incident Mr Long spoke to a number of people from other similar businesses to inform them of how the incident involving Mr Bard had occurred and advising them to update their SWMS to provide for an exclusion zone around the wood chipper whilst they were engaged in tree felling. Mr Long obviously had approximately 16 years of experience in the work undertaken and it is pertinent that he had not been instructed as an employee, nor foreseen as an employer, the need for the exclusion zone around the wood chipper.
	
	
	The offender also achieved ISO 9001 certification on 19 August 2014.
	
	
	Mr Long worked with Mr Bard at Active Tree Services from about early 2006. They had undergone training and completed a number of courses together. Mr Long considered Mr Bard to be a friend. Mr Long annexed documentation relating to Mr Bard’s training and the qualifications that he had attained.
	
	
	After the incident Mr Long personally paid Mr Bard’s widow the sum of $500 per week for approximately 20 weeks until she received payments in respect of Mr Bard’s life insurance and worker’s compensation death benefit.
	
	
	Mr Long expressed sorrow and remorse in relation to Mr Bard’s death. He acknowledged the cause of the accident and accepted responsibility for it. He deposed that the incident has reinforced his commitment “to be vigilant and proactive in all aspects of safety in the workplace”.
	
	
	Mr Long accepted that he failed to properly supervise Mr Bard in that he failed to instruct him to move away from the wood chipper when he was holding the guide rope. Mr Long deposed that at the relevant time he was in part concentrating on the use of a chainsaw to make the necessary cuts to fell the tree.
	
	
	When Mr Long saw that Mr Bard had been injured he tried to assist him by holding the wound on his neck together until the ambulance arrived, during which time Mr Bard was bleeding profusely.
	
	
	After the incident Mr Long has suffered considerable mental distress. Mr Long has had recurring nightmares that centre on the images of the blood that he observed on the day of the incident. Mr Long has been prescribed antidepressant medication by his general practitioner. He has consulted a counsellor, Emma Taylor. Mr Long annexed a report of Ms Taylor dated 5 February 2015. The incident has caused Mr Long difficulty in attending to the needs of the business. He has been unable to close the business down as a result of his financial commitments and loyalty to his employees.
	
	
	Mr Long provided an inclusive list of pro bono work undertaken and charitable donations made by the offender at his direction. Mr Long deposed that the offender has incurred legal costs in relation to these proceedings in the sum of $25,000.
	
	
	Mr Meredith is a qualified Chartered Accountant. He annexed the offender’s profit and loss statement for the period 1 July 2012 to 31 March 2015. The offender has not made a profit since the incident.
	
	
	Mr Long draws a wage of $1,200 per week and Mrs Long draws a wage of $500 per week. Mr Meredith estimated that the annualised sales for the current financial year would be reduced by approximately $138,000 as a result of Mr Long’s intention to reduce the size of the business undertaking and his mental stress and anguish following the death of Mr Bard.
	
	
	Mr Meredith pointed out the significant increase in the offender’s workers compensation premiums following the incident. Mr Meredith deposed that the offender has paid QAS Systems a sum of $23,584 since the incident to upgrade its safety systems.
	
	
	Mr Meredith deposed that the offender has a current tax liability to the Australian Taxation Office of approximately $50,000.
	
	
	Mr Long and Mr Meredith were not required for cross-examination. I would pause to note at this point that I observed the demeanour of both men in Court during the sentence hearing. At times Mr Long was visibly upset and was comforted by Mr Meredith. Mrs Long was also present in Court to support her husband at a difficult time.
	


Consideration


	
	Both the prosecution and the offender reminded me of the general principles to be applied in the sentencing process and I have had regard to those matters, which were helpfully set out in the written submissions of the parties.
	


Objective seriousness of the offence


	
	The proportionality principle requires that a sentence should neither exceed nor be less than the gravity of the crime having regard to the objective circumstances: Veen v R (No 2) (1988) 164 CLR 465 at 472, 485-6, 490-1 and 496. At common law, the term “objective circumstances” was used to describe the circumstances of the crime. The gravity of the offence was assessed by reference to its objective seriousness: R v McNaughton (2006) 66 NSWLR 566 at [15].
	
	
	The task requires the court to consider where in the range of conduct covered by the offence the conduct of the offender falls: Baumer v R (1988) 166 CLR 51 at 57. This assessment will generally indicate the appropriate range of sentences available which will reflect the objective seriousness of the offence committed, and set the limits within which a sentence proportional to the criminality of the offender will lie: BW v R [2011] NSWCCA 176 at [70].
	
	
	The sentencing judge should take into account not only the conduct which actually constitutes the crime, but also such of the surrounding circumstances as are directly related to that crime and are properly regarded as circumstances of aggravation or mitigation: R v Wilkinson (No 5) [2009] NSWSC 432 at [61].
	
	
	The existence of a reasonably foreseeable risk to safety that is likely to result in serious injury or death is a factor relevant to the gravity of the offence: Capral Aluminium Limted v Workcover Authority of New South Wales (2000) 49 NSWLR 610 at [89]. The question of forseeability of the risk is to be determined objectively.
	
	
	The risk particularised in the Amended Summons was as follows:
	


There was a risk that a rope being used as part of a tree felling process may become caught or entangled in the feed-in mechanisms of a wood chipper during such tree felling causing such rope to snap taut at high velocity and strike a worker, resulting in serious injury or death.


	
	That risk was remote. The precise mechanism of the injury that led to Mr Bard’s death was not reasonably foreseeable. Whilst such foresight is not required to attract criminal liability, it is a circumstance of mitigation in this case.
	
	
	There were very simple measures available to eliminate the risk including, the enforcement of an exclusion zone around the wood chipper, the deactivation of the wood chipper whilst the tree felling involving the use of the guide rope was in progress and the proper supervision of Mr Bard by requiring him to move away from the branches being fed into the wood chipper.
	
	
	The death of Mr Bard is a matter relevant to the gravity of the offence.
	
	
	At the time of the incident, Mr Long was operating a chainsaw and was required to exercise some care for his own safety. In my view this is also a circumstance of mitigation as it provides some explanation of his failure to properly supervise Mr Bard at the critical moment.
	
	
	This is a case involving a freak but preventable accident that resulted in the tragic death of a valued employee.
	


Deterrence


	
	There is a requirement for the penalty imposed in relation to this offence to provide for general deterrence. The penalty should draw attention to persons operating similar businesses which are inherently dangerous to employees that it is necessary to ensure that they operate without avoidable risk to the health and safety of their employees.
	
	
	The requirement for the penalty imposed to provide for specific deterrence is significantly reduced for the following reasons.
	
	
	First, the offender has taken steps to significantly upgrade its safety systems.
	
	
	Second, the offender by its prior conduct, in the engagement of QAS Systems and other measures had demonstrated a significant commitment to workplace safety.
	
	
	Third, the offender has through Mr Long has accepted responsibility for its failings that led to the incident and expressed an apology, remorse and contrition.
	
	
	Fourth, Mr Long the sole director of the offender, has provided financial support in the sum of approximately $10,000 to Mr Bard’s widow prior to the payment of benefits to which she became entitled following Mr Bard’s death.
	
	
	Finally, Mr Long has suffered significant mental distress and anguish as a result of Mr Bard’s death. This is to be taken into account as both a form of extra curial punishment of the sole director of the offender and as affecting the financial viability of the offender arising from his impairment.
	
	
	Aggravating factors
	
	
	The injury, emotional harm, loss or damage caused by the offence was substantial: section 21A(2)(g) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. The purposes of sentencing often overlap and the court must have regard to the death of Mr Bard as an aggravating feature of the offence, notwithstanding that it has also been taken into account in assessing the objective seriousness of the offence.
	


Mitigating factors.


	
	The offender does not have any prior convictions: section 21A(3)(e) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. This factor should be assessed by reference to the fact that the offender has operated the business since January 2010 and has employed a varying number of employees and contractors in that period.
	
	
	The offender has demonstrated remorse: section 21A(3)(i) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. Mr Long has expressed sincere regret and remorse over the death of Mr Bard and the failings of the offender that led to the incident. Mr Long has accepted responsibility on behalf of the offender for the acts and/or omissions that were the cause of the incident. Mr Long considered Mr Bard to be a friend and I am satisfied that his evidence reflects genuine remorse and contrition. My conclusion in this regard coincides with my observations of him, Mrs Long and Mr Meredith when they were before the Court.
	
	
	The offender was a person of good character: section 21A(3)(f) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. The evidence demonstrates that the offender was aware of the need to be conscious of workplace safety and to implement systems to achieve it. The offender undertakes pro bono work in the course of its business and makes charitable donations.
	
	
	The offender entered a plea of guilty to the Amended Summons at the earliest possible opportunity: sections 21A(3)(k) and 22 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. The offender is entitled to a discount on penalty that reflects the utilitarian value of that plea. The extent of the discount should generally be assessed in the range of 10-25%, but that is only a guide. The primary consideration in determining where in the range a particular case should fall, is the timing of the plea so that the earlier the plea the greater the discount: R v Thomson & Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 and R v Borkowski (2009) 195 A Crim R 1 at [32]. The plea also indicates remorse: Borkowski at [32]. The prosecutor accepted that the offender’s plea was an early one. The discount can also result in a different type of sentence: R v Lo [2003] NSWCCA 313. It is appropriate to allow the maximum discount available for the plea of guilty in this case.
	
	
	The offender co-operated with the investigation: section 21A(3)(m) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.
	


Capacity to pay a fine


	
	Section 6 Fines Act 1996 provides:
	
	
	In the exercise by a court of a discretion to fix the amount of any fine, the court is required to consider:
	


(a)   such information regarding the means of the accused as is reasonably and practicably available to the court for consideration, and

(b)   such other matters as, in the opinion of the court, are relevant to the fixing of that amount.


	
	The Court is required to have regard to this provision. Where an offender seeks to have a fine reduced on the basis of a limited capacity to pay, it bears the evidentiary onus of convincing the Court that it should exercise its discretion to limit the amount of the fine.
	
	
	The offender’s evidence reflected a limited capacity to pay a fine. The offender has not returned a profit since the incident occurred in June 2013. The offender is a small family company. The earning capacity of Mr Long and his wife is exercised through the corporate vehicle. They draw a combined range of $1,700 per week from which they support themselves and a young daughter. The revenue of the business has decreased. The offender has a liability to the ATO in the sum of $50,000.
	
	
	Mr Long’s ability to operate the business and to maximise its financial return has been adversely affected by the mental anguish and distress that he suffered as a result of the death of Mr Bard.
	
	
	I have also taken into account that Mr Long has paid $10,000 of his own money to Mr Bard’s widow to financially support her. I am cognisant of the fact that any monetary penalty imposed on the offender will have a direct impact on the financial position of Mr Long and his family.
	


Penalty


	
	Taking all of those matters into account and giving full effect to the discount for the plea of guilty, the appropriate order is that the offender is convicted without imposing any other penalty pursuant to section 10A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.
	


Costs


	
	To give effect to the agreement of the parties, I order that the offender pay the prosecutor’s costs in the sum of $14,000.

2703486,Elmowy v R [2015] NSWCCA 85,"Judgment


	
	MACFARLAN JA: In 2014 the applicant, Alexander Elmowy, was convicted after trial of two offences alleged in the Indictment in the following terms:
	


“1. Between the 15th day of April 2013 and the 30th day of April 2013, at Bondi in the state of New South Wales, [Alexander Elmowy] did have sexual intercourse with [the complainant] without her consent and knowing that [she] had not consented to the sexual intercourse.

2. On 10 June 2013 at Bondi in the state of New South Wales [Alexander Elmowy] did attempt to have sexual intercourse with [the complainant] without her consent and knowing that [she] had not consented to the sexual intercourse.”


	
	The applicant seeks leave to appeal under s 5(1)(b) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) on the ground that the jury’s verdicts are unreasonable (see s 6(1) of the Act). In determining such a ground of appeal, this Court must make “an independent assessment of the evidence, both as to its sufficiency and its quality” and determine “whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty” (SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; 243 CLR 400 at [11] and [14]). The “central question” to be answered in making such an independent assessment is whether the court is satisfied that the applicant was guilty of the offences (ibid at [20]).
	
	
	Having made such an assessment, I am, for the reasons stated below, of the view that the Crown proved its case beyond reasonable doubt and that it was therefore open to the jury to convict the applicant.
	


THE EVIDENCE AT THE TRIAL

The complainant’s evidence


	
	In about August 2010 the complainant who was then aged about 20 formed a relationship with the applicant who was aged about 22. She moved into the home in which he lived with his parents and younger brother. In March 2011 she moved with the family to another home but in about October 2011 she moved out of the home at the request of the applicant and his family. She said in cross-examination that she was deeply in love with the applicant at that time. After a short period living with her mother, the complainant moved in January 2012 into an apartment in Bondi. The applicant helped her to find the apartment and assisted her in moving. They continued their relationship but it was deteriorating and ended in mid-August 2012. After that, they continued to speak to each other about once a week and had sexual contact about once a month. This continued until April 2013.
	
	
	In the first half of April 2013 the complainant and the applicant had a consensual sexual encounter but the complainant became aware after it that the applicant had had sex with another woman on the previous day. The complainant told him that she did not want to see him again, nor have any contact with him. However two weeks later she sent him a text message with a property sale result that she thought would interest him and told him that she wanted to maintain a friendship. At the end of April the applicant came, by arrangement, to the complainant’s apartment to collect a box of his belongings that remained there.
	
	
	The complainant gave evidence as follows of what became count 1 in the Indictment against the applicant.
	
	
	After arriving at the apartment, the applicant sat on the bed because he had hurt his leg at sports training. The complainant told him about her new job. In cross-examination she agreed that she told him that she felt more independent and confident but denied suggesting that they resume their relationship and telling him that she missed him and that he was looking good (transcript p 78-9).
	
	
	After about 15 minutes she offered to give him a hand to pull him off the bed. He grabbed her hand and instead of pulling himself up off the bed, pulled the complainant down to him on the bed. She said “what are you doing I didn’t invite you here to have sex with me. Please, I don’t want this”. He pulled his pants down with one of his hands and put his penis inside her vagina for two to three minutes, until he ejaculated. One hand was pinning her down as he slid his pants down with the other. He did not take his pants off completely. While this was happening the complainant was trying to squirm away from him. She struggled but did not scream.
	
	
	The applicant then got up went to the bathroom and left the apartment. After he left, the complainant was in shock, upset and confused, and started to cry.
	
	
	She said that she did not go to the police after this incident because she was confused and “didn’t know whether or not, like he – he was allowed to do what he just done, and I just wanted to forget about it and like pretend that it’d never happened and just sort of move on with my life and just forget it” (transcript p 20).
	
	
	When asked in evidence whether she told anyone about the incident, the complainant said that she told Sam Williamson in early May 2013 that “the last time [the applicant] had sex with me he pinned me down and forced himself on me” (transcript p 20, pp 83-4).
	
	
	The complainant gave the following evidence concerning what became the subject of count 2 in the Indictment.
	
	
	In early June 2013 the applicant contacted the complainant and requested that she return a dress that he had given to her. She told him that she would deliver it to the apartment of a mutual friend who lived in the same building as her. On 10 June 2013 the applicant sent a text message to the complainant saying that he was at that apartment. The complainant told him that she would drop down to the apartment but “just to hold on because I’d just jumped out of the shower, just to give me five minutes and I would take the dress down …” (transcript p 21).
	
	
	However a few minutes later the applicant arrived at the complainant’s door. She was wearing pyjama shorts and a bra as she had just had a shower. She let the applicant into the apartment and, as she turned around to get the dress from the wardrobe, he grabbed her around the waist and pushed her onto the bed. He got onto the bed on top of her and put her legs on his shoulders and put one hand on her chest and neck area. She tried to resist him. He pulled down his pants and pulled his penis out but she moved her legs around the bed saying “please don’t do this to me” and “I don’t want to do this”. He held her down while she moved around on the bed to prevent him inserting his penis (transcript p 22). After two to three minutes of trying to force his penis inside her, he said “if you’re not going to let me fuck you then at least let me pull myself and cum on you”. He then masturbated for about 10 seconds and ejaculated on her stomach. He then released his hold (transcript p 22).
	
	
	The complainant immediately jumped up and went to the shower. When she came out the applicant was gone.
	
	
	The complainant said that within a day or so of 10 June 2013 she told her boss at work, Ms Helen Saunders, “pretty much … everything that happened” on 10 June 2013.
	
	
	On 12 and 13 June 2013 the complainant and her friend Jessica Fletcher who lived in Hong Kong exchanged a number of text messages. A transcript of these was tendered and became exhibit 1 at the trial (see [28] below).
	
	
	The complainant gave evidence that on 12 June 2013 she changed her telephone number so that the applicant could not contact her anymore. However she received more messages from the applicant about two weeks later as he had obtained the complainant’s new number from a mutual friend. Messages passing between them on 29 June 2013 were exhibit 3 in the proceedings (see [29] below). They related to a loan that the applicant had made to the complainant and that the complainant was repaying by instalments.
	
	
	In cross-examination, the complainant said in relation to the principal text message of 29 June 2013:
	


“At the time I read it I was upset that he had obtained my number, because I changed my number so that he couldn’t contact me and I didn’t understand why he was contacting me when the money was already being automatically debited every week from my account, so when this texting was going on, I was really upset, I was upset that he was contacting me. I didn’t want anything to do with him, I didn’t, after what he had done to me like I didn’t want him to be talking to me, so any of this, just straight over my head, I wasn’t, yeah, I was upset that he had my number, that’s the main thing that I was worried about, that he was contacting me when I didn’t [want] him to be” (transcript p 88).


	
	On 30 June 2013 the complainant went with her mother to Waverley police station where she told a police officer “that I was scared of Xander and that I wanted protection because of what he had done to me” (transcript p 37). She then gave a formal statement. She said that she did not go to the police immediately after the 10 June 2013 incident as “I was embarrassed, I wanted to forget about it. I thought that changing my number would be enough for him to not contact me anymore” (transcript p 40).
	


Mr Samuel Williamson


	
	Mr Williamson gave evidence that the complainant was a longstanding friend of his whom he regarded as a sister. He said that in early May 2013 she told him of an incident that occurred between herself and the applicant. He said: “I don’t remember the exact conversation but as the statement [not in evidence] says she basically said along the lines of something physical that she didn’t want to do” (transcript p 115). He said that she was clearly upset by the incident and that “[s]he was just withdrawn, head down, it was as if she’d let it slip out, she didn’t want to talk about it, she didn’t want to tell me but she had”. He said that he had never seen her like that before.
	


Ms Jessica Fletcher


	
	Ms Fletcher gave evidence of the accuracy of the transcript of text messages which was exhibit 1 at the trial. The messages were communicated using the messaging system known as “Whats-App”.
	


Ms Helen Saunders


	
	Ms Saunders who was the complainant’s boss at work said that she had spoken as follows to the complainant on the telephone in mid-June 2013 when the complainant did not come in to work:
	


“I called her and she was very quiet, she wasn’t her usual bubbly and she told me she – she’s having some personal problems and that her sick leave was not due to work commitment, as in stress through work, she was off sick with personal problems and she’s clearly upset by her voice and her tone and the way she was communicating which was very sad” (transcript p 131).


	
	Ms Saunders said that soon after this conversation she spoke to the complainant in a private meeting room at work and that the complainant told her that “she had been sexually assaulted by her ex-boyfriend” in her apartment. Ms Saunders stated:
	


“She actually kind of described what happened, so she told me that her ex-boyfriend had been in contact with her and via text message asking to give a – him a dress back that he had bought her during the relationship, I think it was worth – it was quite expensive. So she had told him that she would leave this dress with a mutual friend who lived downstairs in the apartment block, I think, so I believe she dropped the dress off, maybe a couple of days before, that’s a bit unclear, I can’t remember when she said she dropped it off but I know she said she dropped the dress off. But instead of him picking the dress up from the mutual friend downstairs, he came to her apartment he knocked on the door and she told me that she called out and asked who it was because she’d just come out of the shower and didn’t immediately go and open the door because she was – I think she may have been just in a towel. So she – when she realised it was her ex-boyfriend, she then opened the door to let him in and he then came into the apartment and on a couple of occasions asked if they could have sexual intercourse. She repeatedly said no to him. He – she told me he then forced her onto a nearby bed and proceeded to masturbate. She was constantly calling out, she didn’t want anything to happen, she didn’t want to have sex with him and he masturbated and ejaculated over her. She was really upset. She told him then that he was never ever to do that again and he smirked at her and said ‘Do what?’. He then left the apartment. So in terms of the question, her description of the incident was to me, in my mind, was sexual assault and that’s how she described that, what had happened” (transcript p 132).


	
	Ms Saunders said that a week or so later the complainant told her that her ex-boyfriend had obtained her new mobile phone number and had started to contact her again via text message. The complainant told her that: “She was going to report – because he’d got her number again, she felt again threatened, that she was going to report the incident” and “she was going to report another incident, that’s what she said, she was going to report another incident that happened previously. She didn’t tell me anything about that incident, there’s no details, she just said she was going to report that sexual assault that she told me about and another incident” (transcript p 133).
	
	
	In cross-examination Ms Saunders agreed with the proposition that she had the impression from the description given to her by the complainant that “the boyfriend came into the apartment and sort of as it were hassled her for sex and she refused” (transcript p 134).
	


Senior Constable Elizabeth Cook


	
	A statement of Senior Constable Cook was read to the jury. She said that on 30 June 2013 the complainant attended at Waverley Police Station with her mother “and told me that she wanted to report a sexual assault”. The complainant then gave a description of the two incidents the subject of the Indictment. Senior Constable Cook observed that the complainant “was embarrassed about talking about [the subject of the complaints] and when questioned further she started getting teary and upset”. The complainant was recorded to have said that “she had told some friends and work colleagues what happened and they told me to report it” (transcript p 156). She said that she had seen a doctor because she could not sleep and was depressed.

Exhibit 3: text messages between the applicant and the complainant (denoted as “C”)


	
	The text messages were as follows:
	


“29 June 2013

10.38 am

AE: I have been more than fair. We agreed upon $100/week sometime ago. $4K from Thailand and $2.5K I have you to clear your CC debt. $20/week with a pay rise and a new job is unacceptable. I will call you to discuss because I know you won’t be calling me. $20/week is ridiculous and $5 is an insult!

C: First and last chance you get to hear from me so listen up. I do NOT owe you 4k    from Thailand. Yes for C.C it is 2.5k I paid you 500 from my tax last year and 500 when we broke up. An insult? Be grateful you’re getting automatic weekly payments. You have absolutely no idea of my financial situation so don’t you dare assume anything, ever. I changed my number for a reason – leave me alone Alexander. You have no reason to contact me at all the payments are scheduled payments. So please leave me alone and do not contact me again, ever.

11.05 am

AE: I don’t want you in my life either but the only item you are dragging this out. Constantly made promises and fooled me to get your way. Now you are dragging it out. Your true colours have shown! What do you owe me for Thailand if its not $4K?

11.21 am

AE: I am happy to get a letter drawn up from the solicitor or pursue a statement of claim. I really have no issues to make all correspondence through them so we don’t talk for the outstanding monies.”

The applicant’s evidence


	
	The applicant gave evidence that when the complainant was asked to move out of his family home in about November 2011, she became hysterical, screaming “no”. He said that when she moved into her Bondi apartment he spent two nights a week there but the relationship was disintegrating. In about August or September 2012 they broke up but continued to have sex once or twice a month on average. He said that the sexual encounter the subject of count 1 in the Indictment was consensual and in fact initiated by the complainant (transcript p 184). He also said that on the occasion in June when he collected the dress from the complainant that they did not have any physical or sexual contact.
	
	
	In cross-examination, the applicant gave evidence of an occasion in early April 2013 when he and the complainant had sexual intercourse. He said that the complainant’s observation of a mark on his neck obtained during recent sexual intercourse with another woman led to the complainant saying that she did not want to have sexual intercourse with him anymore. His evidence of the timing of this conversation (early April 2013) indicated that it occurred some weeks before the occasion the subject of count 1 which the applicant accepted occurred “[t]owards the end of April, 2013” (transcript p 163).
	
	
	The applicant accepted in cross-examination that he knew that when the complainant changed her mobile phone number (on 12 June 2013) that she did not want him to contact her but that he obtained her new number from a mutual friend and sent her a text message on 29 June 2013 (exhibit 3).
	


Character evidence


	
	Three persons gave character evidence on behalf of the applicant.
	


RESOLUTION OF THE APPEAL


	
	In support of his submission that the jury verdicts were unreasonable and his convictions should be set aside, the applicant relied upon the following passage from the judgment of the plurality in M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; 181 CLR 487 at 494:
	


“If the evidence, upon the record itself, contains discrepancies, displays inadequacies, is tainted or otherwise lacks probative force in such a way as to lead the court of criminal appeal to conclude that, even making full allowance for the advantages enjoyed by the jury, there is a significant possibility that an innocent person has been convicted, then the court is bound to act and to set aside a verdict based upon that evidence”.


	
	The applicant submitted that, to aid its independent assessment of the evidence, the Court should view the audio visual recording made of the complainant’s evidence. As pointed out in SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; 243 CLR 400 at [31], reference by an appellate court to the transcript of evidence is sufficient in the absence of particular circumstances requiring a different approach. There is nothing of that character in this case as there is no basis for thinking that the written transcript does not adequately reflect the complainant’s evidence. Moreover, as is also apparent from SKA v The Queen (at [29] and [30]), the viewing of a video of the evidence of one witness only (no video being available in this case of the evidence of other witnesses) might well result in an undue focus upon the evidence of that witness, to the possible detriment of the accused person. For these reasons, I have not viewed the recording.
	
	
	The applicant relied upon some 13 matters to support his contention that the jury verdicts were unreasonable. I deal with these as follows.
	
	
	First, the applicant relied upon inconsistencies between the complainant’s and Senior Constable Cook’s evidence of what the complainant said to the latter on 30 June 2013. However, such inconsistencies as there are are minor, and the substance of the complainant’s evidence concerning Counts 1 and 2 is reflected in Senior Constable Cook’s evidence of what the complainant said. As a result Senior Constable Cook’s evidence provides evidence of complaint, supportive of the prosecution’s case.
	
	
	Secondly, the applicant relied upon two changes made by the complainant to a statement she signed on 1 July 2013. However in my view the changes were minor and not of present significance.
	
	
	Thirdly, the applicant submitted in relation to the late April incident that it “is difficult to appreciate how penetration could have been effected if the [applicant] did not take his pants completely off”. However the jury was well able to form a view about the practicality of what the complainant described. I do not consider that any impracticability has been demonstrated by the applicant.
	
	
	Fourthly, the applicant relied upon a difference between the evidence of the complainant and that of Mr Williamson to the extent that Mr Williamson did not recall being given any particulars of the April incident. This is consistent with a simple difference in recollection and is of no present significance. What is of more importance is that Mr Williamson confirmed that the complainant had told him that she had been sexually assaulted by the applicant.
	
	
	Fifthly, the applicant submitted that the fact that the complainant let the applicant into her apartment prior to the 10 June incident suggested that the late April incident had been consensual. However, this does not follow. On the complainant’s evidence, the applicant suddenly and unexpectedly arrived at her door. To give him the dress that he wanted returned, rather than sending him away, was a not obviously unnatural reaction to his arrival. In allowing the applicant to enter the apartment, the complainant was not admitting a stranger but someone with whom she had cohabited for a substantial period of time. Whilst he had sexually assaulted her on an earlier occasion, she was “embarrassed, ashamed and … confused” by the event and had not decided to report it to the police (transcript p 20). She admitted the complainant to her apartment merely to enable her to return to him the dress that he had given her.
	
	
	Sixthly, the applicant relied upon differences between, on the one hand, the complainant’s evidence of the 10 June incident and her description of what she told Ms Saunders and, on the one hand, Ms Saunders’ evidence of what the complainant told her. Ms Saunders accepted the proposition when it was put to her in cross-examination that the complainant told her that the applicant had in effect “hassled” her for sex when he arrived at the apartment whereas this did not form part of the complainant’s evidence. Indeed, the complainant denied that this occurred. Nevertheless, Ms Saunders’ evidence provided significant support to the prosecution’s case as it was evidence of a contemporaneous complaint by the complainant of a recent sexual assault of her by the applicant in her apartment (as well as of the earlier sexual assault). Most of the details were consistent although there was the discrepancy just referred to. That could well have come about as a result of a misunderstanding or misrecollection by Ms Saunders of a description by the complainant of her resistance to the applicant’s repeated attempts to have sex with her by inserting his penis into her vagina. In any event, the discrepancy is not of such significance as to cast doubt on the complainant’s credibility or reliability.
	
	
	Seventhly, the applicant relied upon the complainant’s evidence that she had also told another work colleague, Ms Hayley Osbourne, of the 10 June incident and the fact that the prosecution did not call Ms Osbourne as a witness nor explain her absence. It may be that Ms Osbourne could not recall the conversation or that the complainant was simply mistaken about speaking to her. The point is of limited significance but the trial judge in any event brought the point to the jury’s attention by giving it a Jones v Dunkel direction concerning Ms Osbourne.
	
	
	Eighthly, the applicant submitted that it was “astonishing” that in light of the complainant’s description of how the applicant held her down during the 10 June incident that there was no evidence of bruising or injury occasioned to her. However there was no evidence that any of the witnesses at the trial, other than the police, would have been in a position to observe any such injury and, so far as the police were concerned, they did not first see the complainant until some three weeks after the incident. Moreover, it is by no means clear that bruising would have resulted from the incident, particularly in light of the complainant’s description of what she meant by the applicant having his hand on her throat or neck. She said that his hand moved from her throat to her shoulders. The trial judge and counsel described her demonstration in the witness box as indicating places on her upper chest at the base of her throat and between her throat and her sternum (transcript pp 99-100).
	
	
	Ninthly, the applicant relied upon the complainant’s answer of “I didn’t know what would happen” to a question put in cross-examination to the effect that when she said in her police statement that she was willing to attend court if the matter should proceed that far “did you think that this matter would not end up in court?” (transcript p 105). Why this answer was said to be of significance was not explained. In my view it was not significant.
	
	
	Tenthly, the applicant pointed out that the trial judge gave to the jury a Jones v Dunkel direction in relation to a doctor that the complainant said that she consulted prior to her attendance on the police. However the only evidence of the consultation was that Senior Constable Cook had recorded in her notebook that the complainant had said she had seen a doctor because she could not sleep and was depressed, and that the doctor had referred her to a psychologist. There was no basis for inferring that the doctor would have been able to provide relevant evidence concerning the sexual assaults or evidence of complaint. Neither party suggested at the trial that the doctor might have been able to do this.
	
	
	Eleventhly, the applicant referred to the complainant’s comment to Ms Fletcher recorded in exhibit 1, that the applicant was “the scum of the earth” and Ms Fletcher’s comment in the same exhibit that the applicant should be reported “so it’s on his records”. Assuming the truth of the complainant’s allegations of sexual assault, these were hardly surprising comments to be made in the course of the communications with Ms Fletcher. They do not therefore conflict with the complainant’s evidence.
	
	
	Twelfthly, the applicant submitted that he “was not in any way embarrassed or contradicted by cross-examination”. This is a factor to be taken into account although it is difficult to reconcile his evidence, on the one hand, that the complainant was upset in early April 2013 when she found out that the applicant had recently had sex with another woman and that the complainant told him that she did not want to have any further sexual intercourse or “physical closeness” with, on the other hand, his evidence (denied by the complainant) that later in the same month she initiated and consented to the sexual intercourse the subject of count 1 in the Indictment. Moreover, in assessing the significance of this factor, account must be taken of the advantage which the jury had, but this Court did not have, of seeing and hearing the witnesses, including the applicant, give their evidence.
	
	
	Finally, the applicant referred to the complainant having on five occasions requested a break during evidence. It is clear from the transcript that the complainant was upset whilst giving evidence and found the experience stressful. Her requests for breaks did not reflect adversely on her credit or her reliability. They were understandable reactions to her upset and stress.
	


Conclusion


	
	Having conducted an independent assessment of the evidence at the trial, my view is that the prosecution proved its case beyond reasonable doubt and that the applicant’s convictions are not unsafe, unsound or unreasonable. For the reasons that I have given above, none of the points made by the applicant on appeal, either in isolation or in combination with the other points, raise any doubt about the soundness of the verdicts of the jury which had the advantage of seeing and hearing the evidence of the witnesses whose credibility and reliability was in issue. There was no suggestion on appeal that the jury was not properly instructed as to onus of proof and all other relevant matters.
	
	
	The following matters are strongly supportive of the verdicts:
	



	
	The complainant’s evidence of events was, on my reading of the transcript, sensible, logical and credible. Her cross-examination by the applicant’s counsel did not raise doubts as to the credibility or reliability of her evidence. In particular, the complainant adequately explained such delays as there were in complaining of the sexual assaults.
	
	
	The record in exhibit 1 of the text messages passing between the complainant and Ms Fletcher was compelling contemporaneous documentary evidence of a complaint by the complainant that strongly supported the prosecution case. The messages were expressed in understandably colloquial terms, having a ring of credibility to the information and sentiments conveyed. Exhibit 1 was admissible not only to support the credibility of the complainant but to prove the truth of the facts which she asserted in the text messages and repeated in her evidence (s 66 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW)).
	
	
	The prosecution case was likewise supported by the complaint evidence given by Mr Williamson and Ms Saunders. Differences between their evidence of the complaints and that given by the complainant were not of a marked or unusual character. They did not detract from the clear evidence of those persons that the complainant complained to them of her sexual assault by the applicant.
	



	
	For these reasons, whilst I would grant leave to appeal, I would dismiss the appeal.
	
	
	SIMPSON J: I agree with Macfarlan JA. Having considered the whole of the evidence, I am satisfied that the applicant was rightly convicted of both offences.
	
	
	SCHMIDT J: I agree with Macfarlan JA.
	
	
	At trial the jury did not accept the applicant’s case that the complaints against him had been made in the aftermath of the breakdown of his former relationship with the complainant, who had used sexual allegations as a weapon against him; that their relationship had broken down after the complainant had learned of his infidelity, even though she had later contacted him again; that after she had changed her phone number, he had obtained the new number from a mutual friend, in order to contact her about the debt she owed him; that there were various problems with the complainant’s evidence, including discrepancies between her evidence and that of other witnesses; and that that he was a truthful witness, who had given believable evidence which the jury would accept, that the intercourse the subject of count 1 had been consensual and that the events the subject of count 2 had never occurred.
	
	
	The applicant also submitted that it was relevant that while the complainant had needed various breaks, while giving her evidence, she had needed none when being cross-examined about photographs of her home. This was submitted to have revealed that her demeanour and evidence were not convincing or reliable, with the result that he was entitled to the benefit of the doubts which arose from the complainant's evidence.
	
	
	The jury, nevertheless, preferred the complainant’s evidence over that of the applicant.
	
	
	In those circumstances, for the reasons given by Macfarlan JA, I, too, take the view that the video of the complainant’s evidence should not be viewed on appeal, notwithstanding that the complainant required five breaks while giving her evidence.
	
	
	Having considered the evidence, I also agree with the conclusion which his Honour has reached on the conviction appeal, that the verdicts were not unreasonable, for the reasons given. The question is whether the jury must, as distinct from might, have entertained a doubt about the applicant’s guilt (see Libke v The Queen [2007] HCA 30; (2007) 230 CLR 559 at [113]). The evidence did not require the jury to have necessarily entertained a doubt about the applicant’s guilt.

2703489,Miller v R [2015] NSWCCA 86,"Judgment


	
	MEAGHER JA: I agree with the orders proposed by Schmidt J. My reasons for doing so are sufficiently expressed in the judgment of Simpson J.
	
	
	SIMPSON J: I have read in draft the judgment of Schmidt J. I agree with the orders her Honour proposes. My reasons follow.
	


The facts


	
	Both offences were committed on the same evening, 31 August 2013, in company with the same two co-offenders (Matthew Ford and Brett Mallon). The first offence was at the home of a person the applicant knew or believed to be a drug dealer, and was for the purpose of obtaining drugs. The drug dealer was not at home but his female partner, with five children, was. When the woman responded to their knock, she was holding a five week old baby. Upon the woman opening the door, the applicant or one of his co-offenders pointed a large hunting knife at her and demanded drugs. They searched drawers and cupboards in the kitchen and bathroom. One of the offenders behaved aggressively. This prompted the applicant to tell him that the purpose of their invasion was not to hurt the woman or the children.
	
	
	The offenders left when they found the drugs they had come in search of.
	
	
	This event gave rise to the count under s 112(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), of aggravated break, enter and commit an indictable offence. The circumstance of aggravation was that the applicant was in company with two co-offenders. An offence against s 112(2) carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 20 years. Pursuant to Pt 4 Div 1A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) (“the Sentencing Procedure Act”) a standard non-parole period of 5 years is applicable.
	
	
	The second offence was committed at the home of another person the offenders knew or believed to be a drug dealer. That person and his girlfriend were at home. One or more of the offenders kicked the front door, demanded that it be opened, and plunged a knife through a glass bedroom window pane, shattering it. The offenders entered through the shattered window; one of them forced the male occupant backwards, holding a knife against his throat. They told him to get on his “fucking knees” and threatened to kill him. The male was kicked in the face.
	
	
	The applicant demanded drugs. The male indicated where the drugs could be found. The offender holding the knife dragged it from the male’s left shoulder towards his left hip, splitting the skin. A second cut was made from his left rib cage to his right hip. Photographs in evidence demonstrate that the extent of the wounding was significant.
	
	
	The applicant took the male’s laptop and wallet (containing $1100), PlayStation, mobile telephone and jewellery. The offenders took an esky containing drugs (almost certainly marijuana). They left the house; on exiting, they smashed the window of a car that belonged to the female occupant by stabbing at it with a knife.
	
	
	This event gave rise to the second count, under s 112(3) of the Crimes Act, of specially aggravated break, enter and commit indictable offence. The circumstance of special aggravation was the wounding of the male occupant. Such an offence carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 25 years, and a standard non-parole period of 7 years.
	
	
	The sentencing judge used the provisions of s 53A of the Sentencing Procedure Act and imposed an aggregate sentence of imprisonment for 8 years and 4 months, with a non-parole period of 6 years and 3 months. In doing so, in compliance with s 53A(2)(b) he recorded the individual (“indicative”) sentences that he would have imposed had he sentenced for the offences separately. For the first offence, he nominated an indicative sentence of imprisonment for 6 years with a non-parole period of 4 years and 6 months; for the second offence, he nominated an indicative sentence of imprisonment for 7 years and 3 months, with a non-parole period of 5 years and 5 months.
	
	
	The resultant aggregate sentence obviously had a degree of concurrency built into it.
	
	
	His Honour also specified that he allowed a reduction of 25 per cent on the sentence he otherwise would have imposed. A simple calculation shows that the starting point was therefore just over 11 years.
	
	
	The judge declined to find that special circumstances justified departure from the ratio between the head sentence and the non-parole period provided by s 44(2) of the Sentencing Procedure Act. The non-parole period imposed is, in accordance with those proportions, 75 per cent of the head sentence.
	


The applicant’s personal circumstances


	
	The applicant did not give evidence in the sentencing proceedings. Evidence as to his personal history and circumstances was provided in the form of a Pre-Sentence Report, and a psychiatric report prepared by a consultant forensic psychiatrist engaged in the Justice Health network. From those reports, the following was disclosed.
	
	
	The applicant was born in Broken Hill in March 1994, and was 19 years of age at the time of the offences. He has a record of offences in South Australia, which includes possession of drugs, two separate offences of assault, two of carrying offensive weapons, possession of a firearm without a licence, and a variety of others. Although, in respect of the firearms offence, he was sentenced to imprisonment for 3 years and 8 months with a non-parole period of 2 years, that sentence was suspended, subject to conditions. That sentence was imposed on 26 March 2013 and both it and the bond that accompanied it were current at the time of these offences. The applicant has never previously served a sentence of imprisonment.
	
	
	The psychiatric report noted that the applicant is recorded in Justice Health documents as Aboriginal, but that he denies this. The psychiatrist took a history from the applicant of significant childhood deprivation. His father was Italian, but left the family when the applicant was born. The applicant has had no contact with him. When he was 8 years of age his mother was incarcerated for fraud, and he lived for a time with his grandmother. This was not a happy placement, because his grandmother imposed strict rules and discipline. The applicant considered her to be a “control freak”. The applicant told the psychiatrist that he has, from an early age, experienced problems with anger management.
	
	
	It seems that on his mother’s release from custody, he returned to live with her; she was in a relationship with another man who physically and sexually abused the applicant, by, for example, beating him with a belt, kicking him with steel toed boots, locking him in his room for periods of time, and, on one occasion, in a chicken coop.
	
	
	From the age of 12 the applicant lived with his mother in Adelaide. She was a drug user, and he remained with her only for 6 months. The applicant said that he began using cannabis at around the age of 12 years, and alcohol at about 13 years. He denied use of other drugs.
	
	
	The psychiatrist reported that the applicant said that he had been in protection whilst in custody, because he was advised that he was at risk from members of a bikie gang who were associated with the victims of the offences. (There was no other evidence to support this, or to give any detail of the circumstances of his custodial arrangements.)
	
	
	The psychiatrist found no evidence of thought disorder, but noted that the applicant had had problems with anger, paranoia and anxiety from early to mid-adolescence. He noted anxiety symptoms that reflected a mild obsessive compulsive personality or disorder.
	


The Remarks on Sentence


	
	In the opening paragraph of the Remarks on Sentence, the sentencing judge said:
	


“I note that the standard non-parole periods attaching to each charge have been taken into account on the sentence.”


	
	Having then recounted, in some detail, the facts of the offences, his Honour said:
	


“It is plain from the facts that the offenders were on the hunt for drugs. They were prepared to enter private homes to carry out that hunt. They did that without concern for the persons who were living in those homes.”

He went on to say, with respect to the first offence:

“… the house appears to be no more than a family home with a woman and her children. Despite this, the woman was threatened in the presence of her children. It is clear from the facts that the offenders were aware that this victim was present in the house before entering it. It was submitted that the offenders were merely breaking into a house that had been used for the sale of drugs and consequently cannot be viewed as a home for the purpose of assessing whether it is an aggravating fact on sentence. [His Honour was here referring to s 21A(2)(eb) of the Sentencing Procedure Act.] However, there is no evidence that at the time of the break-in, the house was being used for the sale of drugs. The offenders have given no sworn evidence and any assertions made in the various medical and probation reports, tendered in the proceedings about this offence, must be viewed with some circumspection. I regard it as a serious aggravating factor that the offenders were prepared to attack this woman in her own home in the presence of her children.”


	
	However, in respect of the second offence, his Honour said:
	


“In this case, it does appear from the evidence, that the house was being used for the sale of drugs. I accept that in those circumstances, the victims cannot expect to receive the same protection of the law as if the house was merely a home. It can [be] viewed as in effect, a business address where illegal products were being sold. As such, the occupants can expect that criminals will be attracted to the house and that is of course what happened. On the other hand there was a woman who does not appear to have been involved in the offence - any offences with respect to the house - and the facts make it plain that she was terrified by the actions of the offenders.”

[I pause to note that the second sentence of this passage probably reflects an unguarded moment, or loose language in the delivery of extempore remarks. It cannot, however, receive the endorsement of this Court.]


	
	His Honour then went on to consider the objective seriousness of the offences, and said:
	


“Ultimately, each of the offences was serious but in my view, they are not ones that attract the standard non-parole periods.”


	
	He turned to the personal circumstances of the applicant, and referred to the Pre-Sentence and psychiatric reports. He said:
	


“The offender is now 20 years of age. The offender reported a difficult upbringing in a house where violence was common. He was expelled from school for violent behaviour. He started using drugs and alcohol from around the age of 14. His juvenile criminal record bespeaks of [sic] his history. He was a disruptive and violent child who has now emerged as a violent drug addicted adult. Based on his history to date, there are no reasonable prospects of rehabilitation.”


	
	He declined to make a finding of special circumstances pursuant to s 44(2) of the Sentencing Procedure Act. Such a finding, if made, would have permitted departure from the ratio there specified between the non-parole period and the head sentence. He proceeded to impose the sentence set out above at [10].
	


The proposed grounds of appeal


	
	The proposed grounds of appeal are pleaded as follows:
	


“1.  His Honour erred in giving primary or determinative significance to the applicable standard non-parole periods.

2.  His Honour erred in failing to have proper regard to the applicant’s deprived background.

3.  His Honour erred in failing to take into account the fact that the applicant was serving his sentence in protective custody.

4.  The sentence imposed was otherwise manifestly excessive.”

Ground 1: the applicability of the standard non-parole periods


	
	This ground is based upon the decision of the High Court in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120.
	
	
	There are only two references in the Remarks on Sentence to the standard non-parole periods. In the first, his Honour said that they had been taken into account - a course which Muldrock expressly approves and requires (now enacted in s 54B(2) of the Sentencing Procedure Act). In the second, his Honour merely said that the offences did not call for the imposition of the standard non-parole periods. This was plainly a finding that the objective seriousness of the offences was not of mid-range on a scale of objective seriousness applicable to offences of the kind.
	
	
	This ground is, as Schmidt J has found, without foundation. There is nothing in the Remarks on Sentence that lends the slightest support to the complaint. To the contrary, the Remarks show that correct principles were applied. The ground should be rejected.
	


Ground 3: protective custody


	
	The only basis for a finding that the applicant is to serve his sentence in protective custody is the note in the psychiatric report, recording part of the history given by the applicant. There is nothing in the evidence that supports any contention that, assuming that the applicant is currently serving his sentence in protective custody, he will continue to do so; nor is there any evidence of the circumstances of that custody. The time has long since passed when it can be assumed that serving a sentence in protective custody is more onerous than other forms of custody: R v Durocher-Yvon [2003] NSWCCA 299; 58 NSWLR 581; Clinton v R [2009] NSWCCA 276; R v Ah-See [2004] NSWCCA 202; Majid v R [2010] NSWCCA 121.
	
	
	I agree with Schmidt J, for the reasons that she gives, that this ground should be rejected.
	


Ground 2: deprived background


	
	In Bugmy v The Queen [2013] HCA 37; 249 CLR 571 the High Court (specifically in reference to an Aboriginal offender) said:
	


“37  An Aboriginal offender’s deprived background may mitigate the sentence that would otherwise be appropriate for the offence in the same way that the deprived background of a non-Aboriginal offender may mitigate that offender’s sentence …”

The High Court went on to accept a submission (by the Director of Public Prosecutions) that:

“42  … the effects of profound deprivation do not diminish over time and … are to be given full weight in the determination of the appropriate sentence in every case.

43  … The experience of growing up in an environment surrounded by alcohol abuse and violence may leave its mark on a person throughout life. Among other things, a background of that kind may compromise the person’s capacity to mature and to learn from experience. It is a feature of the person’s make-up and remains relevant to the determination of the appropriate sentence, notwithstanding that the person has a long history of offending.

44  Because the effects of profound childhood deprivation do not diminish with the passage of time and repeated offending, it is right to speak of giving ‘full weight’ to an offender’s deprived background in every sentencing decision …”

The High Court, however, went on to note that evidence of an offender’s deprived background does not necessarily have the same mitigatory relevance for all of the purposes of punishment.


	
	As the Court in Bugmy makes plain ([24]), the weight to be accorded to any sentencing consideration, including childhood deprivation, is a matter for the sentencing judge. However, where a relevant factual circumstance has been overlooked, it may be seen that the sentencing discretion has miscarried: House v The King [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499.
	
	
	In this case, the sentencing judge did make brief reference to the applicant’s personal history. But when the features that he mentioned are contrasted with the history taken by the psychiatrist, it seems to me that a material consideration was overlooked. That is because the full extent of the applicant’s personal history and circumstances was not taken into account. That went far beyond the somewhat cursory reference in the Remarks that I have extracted above.
	
	
	I agree with Schmidt J that this ground has been made out.
	


Ground 4: manifest excess


	
	As Muldrock also makes plain, the standard non-parole period remains a relevant guidepost in sentencing for offences to which Div 1A is applicable. It also remains the case that the standard non-parole period is intended to apply to sentencing after trial (R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; 60 NSWLR 168), and allowance must be made for pleas of guilty. In accordance with s 54B(4) of the Sentencing Procedure Act, the sentencing judge specified the non-parole periods he would have imposed had he sentenced separately for the two offences. In this case, he found that the objective seriousness of the offences did not call for the imposition of the standard non-parole period. But the indicative sentence nominated in respect of the first offence included a non-parole period of 4 years and 6 months, against a standard non-parole period of 5 years. It is plain that that failed to take into account either the plea of guilty, or the finding of objective gravity as less than mid-range. It cannot have accommodated both.
	
	
	Section 54B(5) also requires a sentencing court to make a record of the reasons for setting a non-parole period that is longer or shorter than the standard non-parole period, and to identify each factor taken into account. In this case, the sentencing judge overlooked this requirement. That does not invalidate the sentence: s 54B(7). However, a record of the reasons would have shown that the departure from the standard non-parole period was insufficient to reflect the finding that the offences were of less than mid-range gravity, and the plea of guilty.
	
	
	Similarly, in respect of the second offence, against a standard non-parole period of 7 years, an indicative sentence that included a non-parole period of 5 years and 5 months was nominated. After reduction by 25 per cent (in recognition of the plea of guilty), that is greater than the standard non-parole period and again does not reflect the finding of less than mid-range gravity.
	
	
	In my opinion, error has thus been demonstrated in the sentencing process. This Court must proceed to exercise its own independent sentencing discretion: Kentwell v The Queen [2014] HCA 37; 313 ALR 451.
	
	
	In contemplation of such a result, the Court received affidavit evidence as to the applicant’s conduct while in custody. In an affidavit, affirmed on 26 February 2015, the applicant said that he had been in a number of different prisons, but has, since December 2014, been working as a sweeper at Junee Prison, and undertaking an education course working towards a Year 10 Certificate, and is about to start a building, construction and welding course. He has put his name down for an anger management course, but this had not yet started. He has been attending weekly Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. This suggests that there is more optimism for the applicant’s rehabilitation than the sentencing judge was able to find at the time of sentencing.
	
	
	An affidavit filed on behalf of the Crown annexed a letter from the Junee Correctional Centre which confirmed that the applicant is currently a “Special Management Area Placement (SMAP) inmate”. He was admitted to this placement at his own request, possibly precipitated by an assault upon him. According to the letter, the majority of the population at the Junee Correctional Centre are of the same classification and have the same access to services and programs as other SMAP and normal discipline inmates within the centre. He has unhindered access to education, programs and medical services. This does not suggest undue hardship resulting from his serving his sentence in protective custody. He has no disciplinary infringements since being transferred to Junee.
	
	
	Notwithstanding the applicant’s more favourable circumstances, and the disadvantage of his early life, the seriousness of the offences cannot be underestimated. In my opinion, due regard is paid to both of those important considerations by the sentences proposed by Schmidt J.
	
	
	I agree with the orders proposed by her Honour.
	
	
	SCHMIDT J:  The applicant, Mr Cody Aaron Miller, seeks leave to appeal sentences imposed upon him by Blackmore DCJ on 20 March 2014, after he pleaded guilty to two offences of break, enter and steal under s 112 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), committed at Broken Hill in August 2013, for which he received a discount of 25% on sentencing.
	
	
	Mr Miller and his two co-offenders, Mr Mathew Josh Ford and Mr Brett David Mallon, were each sentenced to an aggregate sentence of 8 years and 4 months imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 6 years and 3 months, commencing in Mr Miller’s case on 2 September 2013. His Honour began the sentencing exercise at a total sentence of 11 years. The individual sentences imposed were made partially concurrent:
	


Count 1 – Offence of break, enter and commit serious indictable offence (larceny) in circumstances of aggravation under s 112(2) of the Crimes Act with a maximum term of 20 years imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of 5 years: Imprisonment for 6 years with a non-parole period of 4 years and 6 months.

Count 2 – Offence of break, enter and commit serious indictable offence (larceny) in circumstances of special aggravation under s 112(3) of the Crimes Act with a maximum term of 25 years imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of 7 years: Imprisonment for 7 years and 3 months with a non-parole period of 5 years and 5 months.


	
	Mr Miller presses the following grounds of appeal:
	


“1.    His Honour erred in giving primary or determinative significance to the applicable standard non-parole periods.

2.    His Honour erred in failing to have proper regard to the applicant’s deprived background.

3.    His Honour erred in failing to take into account the fact that the applicant was serving his sentence in protective custody.

4.    The sentence imposed was otherwise manifestly excessive.”

Ground 1 - the standard non-parole periods


	
	This ground was pressed on the basis of his Honour’s observation that “I note that the standard non-parole periods attaching to each charge have been taken into account on the sentence”. His Honour concluded, after considering the agreed facts, that each of Mr Miller’s offences was serious, but “not ones that attract the standard non-parole period”. This was submitted to have revealed error of the kind identified in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CLR 120, that is, erroneously giving the standard non-parole period primary or determinative significance in the sentencing exercise.
	
	
	This submission cannot be accepted. To the contrary, his Honour did precisely what s 54B(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) required of him, namely, to take account of an applicable standard non-parole period, as one of the many matters necessary to be taken into account when undertaking the instinctive synthesis on sentencing discussed in Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; (2005) 228 CLR 357 at [37[ - [39].
	
	
	As discussed in Muldrock at [27], such a standard non-parole period, together with the maximum penalty fixed for the offence, are two statutory guideposts which must be taken into account in a sentencing exercise such as this. It may not be overlooked that s 54B provides, amongst other things:
	


(2)    The standard non-parole period for an offence is a matter to be taken into account by a court in determining the appropriate sentence for an offender, without limiting the matters that are otherwise required or permitted to be taken into account in determining the appropriate sentence for an offender.

(3)    The court must make a record of its reasons for setting a non-parole period that is longer or shorter than the standard non-parole period and must identify in the record of its reasons each factor that it took into account.


	
	I consider that leave to appeal on this ground should be refused. It is baseless.
	


Ground 3 – protective custody


	
	This ground relied on a comment in a psychiatric report, that Mr Miller was serving his custodial sentence in protection, to which no reference was made in the sentencing remarks or at the sentencing hearing. The bare written submission was that this constituted an error of law.
	
	
	Leave to appeal on this ground should also be refused.
	
	
	The submissions advanced on sentence did not place any reliance on the fact that Mr Miller was then serving his sentence in protection. Those submissions related to the two premises invaded having been used for drug supply, which meant, it was argued, that the aggravating factor that the offence had occurred in someone’s home, was not available. It was also argued that the evidence did not leave open a finding that it was Mr Miller who wounded Mr Whitfield. Submissions were also advanced as to Mr Miller’s youth, criminal record and background, to support the argument that his criminal conduct was somewhat explained by that background, which would provide a basis for a finding of special circumstance.
	
	
	That aspect of the psychiatrist’s report was relied on for the first time on appeal. It did not provide a sound basis for any finding as to the circumstances in which Mr Miller was serving his sentence, or the conclusion that it was more onerous than usual, even if any submission about this matter had been advanced on sentencing (see RWB v R [2010] NSWCCA 147; (2010) 202 A Crim R 209 at [192] - [195]).
	
	
	As discussed in Zreika v R [2012] NSWCCA 44; (2012) 223 A Crim R 460 at [81]:
	


“The Victorian Court of Appeal has emphasised recently, that in sentencing appeals, the Court is reviewing the exercise of a discretionary judgment and not rehearing a plea of mitigation. It is not the occasion for the revision and reformulation of the case presented below. The Court will not lightly entertain arguments that could have been put, but were not advanced on the plea, and will have an even greater reluctance to entertain arguments that seek to resile from concessions made below or are a contradiction of submissions previously made. The Court spoke of the need for exceptional circumstances before this can be done, where it can be shown that there was most compelling material available on the plea that was not used or understood, and which demonstrates that there has been a miscarriage of justice arising from the plea and sentence: Romero v R [2011] VSCA 45 at [11]; Keane v R [2011] VSCA 156 at [13],[18]; Bayram v R [2012] VSCA 6 at [28]-[29].”

Ground 2 - Mr Miller’s background and Ground 4 - manifest excess


	
	It is convenient to deal with these grounds together.
	
	
	To establish manifest excess Mr Miller must establish that the sentence imposed upon him was “unreasonable or plainly unjust” (see Dinsdale v The Queen [2000] HCA 54; (2000) 202 CLR 321 at [6]).
	
	
	As the Crown submitted, there is no single correct sentence (see Bugmy v The Queen [2013] HCA 37; (2013) 249 CLR 571 at [24]). Sentencing judges have considerable flexibility in their approach to sentencing, consistent with binding principle and the statutory sentencing regime (see Markarian at [27]). This Court may not simply substitute its opinion for that of a sentencing judge, because it would have exercised the sentencing discretion differently (see Lowndes v The Queen [1999] HCA 29; (1999) 195 CLR 665 at [15]).
	
	
	Nevertheless, I am satisfied that relevant error has here been established, with the result that leave to appeal on these grounds should be given and the appeal upheld.
	
	
	In the guideline judgment in Re Attorney General's Application (No 1) under s 26 of the Criminal Procedure Act; R v Ponfield; R v Scott; R v Ryan; R v Johnson [1999] NSWCCA 435; (1999) 48 NSWLR 327, how the seriousness of offences under s 112(1) is to be assessed was considered. As the Crown submitted, those considerations also apply to the sentencing of offences to which Mr Miller and his co-offenders entered pleas under s 112(2) and (3). They are there to be used as a “check” or “sounding board” or “guide” (see R v Whyte [2002] NSWCCA 343; (2002) 55 NSWLR 252 at [113]). The factors identified in the guideline judgment, which had to be considered separately in relation to each offender, were identified at [48] to be:
	


“   A court should regard the seriousness of offence contrary to s112(1) of the Crimes Act as enhanced and reflect that enhanced seriousness in the quantum of sentence if any of the following factors are present. Necessarily, if more than one such factor is present there is accumulative effect upon seriousness and the need for appropriate reflection.

(i)    The offence is committed whilst the offender is at conditional liberty on bail or on parole.

(ii)    The offence is the result of professional planning, organization and execution.

(iii)    The offender has a prior record particularly for like offences.

(iv)    The offence is committed at premises of the elderly, the sick or the disabled.

(v)    The offence is accompanied by vandalism and by any other significant damage to property.

(vi)    The multiplicity of offence (reflected either in the charges or matters taken into account on a Form 1 pursuant to s21 of the CP Act). In sentencing on multiple counts regard must be had to the criminality involved in each: Pearce v The Queen 1998 72 ALJR 1416.

(vii)    The offence is committed in a series of repeat incursions into the same premises.

(viii) The value of the stolen property to the victim, whether that value is measured in terms of money or in terms of sentimental value.

(ix)    The offence was committed at a time when, absent specific knowledge on the part of the offender (a defined circumstance of aggravation - Crimes Act s105A(1)(f) ), it was likely that the premises would be occupied, particularly at night.

(x)    That actual trauma was suffered by the victim (other than as a result of corporal violence, infliction of actual bodily harm or deprivation of liberty - defined circumstances of aggravation: Crimes Act s105A(1)(c),(d) and (e) ).

(xi)    That force was used or threatened (other than by means of an offensive weapon, or instrument - a defined circumstance of aggravation Crimes Act s105A(1)(a) ).”


	
	Deterrence is also an important consideration in such cases (see R v Maher [2004] NSWCCA 177 at [44]).
	
	
	Mr Miller’s offences and those of his co-offenders were objectively serious, which had to be reflected in the sentence imposed upon each of them. As was also observed in the guideline judgment, however, at [49], in the case of each offender, Blackmore DCJ was also obliged to “give appropriate weight to matters in mitigation as manifest in the particular case”.
	
	
	It is in undertaking this exercise in Mr Miller’s case, that his Honour fell into error.
	


The offences


	
	The facts were not in issue.
	
	
	Mr Miller and his two co-offenders went in a car with Ms Mallon, at about 9.15 pm, to the home of Ms Lehman, where she resided with her five children, who were aged between 12 years and 5 weeks. One of them knocked on the door and asked for “her bloke”. She told him that he no longer lived there. Soon afterwards the three offenders entered Ms Lehman’s home, one of them pointing a large hunting knife at her. She knew one of the offenders, Mr Mallon, who asked her where “the meth” was. She told him there was none there. Mr Miller remained with her, while the others then searched the house.
	
	
	Ms Lehman asked Mr Miller if she could put her kids together in one room. When she looked, two of them were not in their beds. He did not believe that she had other children. She started screaming out for them and he told her that she was lying about the children.
	
	
	When searching the kitchen Mr Ford began screaming at Ms Lehman. Mr Miller said to him “we’re not here to hurt her or the kids”. She was then holding her baby and directed them to the bathroom. While in the bathroom, one of them said ""I've got it. Let’s go."" The offenders then left, taking her phone and other phones with them.
	
	
	Ms Lehman was frightened and attempted to drive her car to look for her other children. It would not start. Police then arrived with the children, who had earlier jumped out of a window and had run to neighbours, who had called police.
	
	
	At 9.40 pm the same night, the offenders went to the home of a Mr Whitfield, where they knocked and kicked at his front door. From the window Mr Whitfield saw Mr Mallon, who he knew. He heard yells of “[o]pen the door” and then a knife came towards the glass and put a hole through it. Mr Whitfield then saw Mr Mallon and Mr Miller at the door and Mr Mallon stab at the glass window with the knife, causing it to smash. He then saw a tomahawk being used to strike the glass.
	
	
	Mr Whitfield got dressed. Mr Mallon and Mr Miller then jumped through the window and pushed him back by the throat. His girlfriend hid in the corner of the room, fearing that she would be harmed by the knife, or physically assaulted.
	
	
	Mr Whitfield did not see who then assaulted him with a knife held to his throat. He was held by a hand placed to the back of his neck, causing it to lift to the ceiling, while being told “on your fucking knees or we’ll fucking kill you”. He was then kicked in the face and the two offenders ran into the lounge room.
	
	
	Outside, Mr Whitfield heard Mr Ford yelling “stab him stab him get rid of him lets go let’s get out of here”. Mr Miller returned and repeatedly asked Mr Whitfield “where’s all your shit, where’s your fucking gear?”. He was still on his knees and pointed to his wallet on the tallboy. He then felt a blade touch his shoulder, split the skin, the knife dragging slowing down his back and then along towards his left hip. He was then cut again, from the left hand side of his rib cage, to his right hip. He then saw Mr Miller take his laptop and his wallet, containing some $1,100 cash. A PlayStation 3, watch, a mobile p[hone and jewellery were also taken.
	
	
	Mr Whitfield was then asked where his “blue esky” and “fucking green” were. He handed them over to Mr Ford, who was still outside. Mr Miller and Mr Mallon then left through the window. Mr Whitfield saw them smash the window of his girlfriend’s car and run away. He saw one of them get into a car.
	
	
	Police and ambulance attended on Mr Whitfield’s home shortly afterwards. He and his girlfriend were treated at hospital.
	
	
	The incident had been captured on CCTV. Mr Whitfield identified Mr Mallon. Mr Ford was identified from the footage, holding the tomahawk and handling the esky. It also depicted the three offenders running away and Mr Mallon damaging the car window.
	
	
	Mr Ford was arrested at 10:20 am on 1 September at his home. Ms Mallon was present. The tomahawk was found in his car and the esky at his home. Ms Mallon made admissions in relation to the two offences. On 2 September, Mr Miller was arrested at his home, where knives and property stolen from Mr Whitfield were found. He admitted his involvement in the offence at Ms Lehman’s home, where he was armed with a knife. He also admitted his involvement in the offences at Mr Whitfield’s home, where he said that weed had been stolen, but he denied knowing that he had injured Mr Whitfield. He explained he had been armed with a weapon, because he believed that 10 people might be present there, and a big dog. He disclosed that his knife was under his pillow at that address.
	


The sentencing remarks


	
	The three offenders were sentenced together. None of the three offenders gave evidence. The one who actually wounded Mr Whitfield was not identified.
	
	
	After considering the evidence as to the nature and seriousness of these offences, Blackmore DCJ turned to Mr Miller’s subjective circumstances and relevant aggravating and mitigating matters.
	
	
	These were objectively both very serious offences. As his Honour found, the offenders were on the hunt for drugs that night, prepared to enter private homes, without concern for those living there, armed and prepared to threaten and injure those who they found there.
	
	
	While Blackmore DCJ took the view that Mr Whitfield’s wounding involved gratuitous cruelty, as it plainly did, he did not find the offences aggravated as a result of that fact, because the person who wielded the knife could not be identified. His Honour also concluded that Mr Whitfield’s house was in effect a business address where illegal products were being sold and so the occupants had to expect that criminals would be attracted to the house and that they could not expect to receive the same protection of the law, than if the house had only been a home.
	
	
	As to the seriousness of the offences, his Honour concluded:
	


“When one comes to consider the seriousness of the offences on a range of seriousness, it should be observed that stealing is not the most serious indictable offence that could be contemplated under the section. Of itself, that must reduce the seriousness of the offences on an objective analysis of them. Each of the offences was in effect a home invasion and as such is something that the law treats very seriously. Clearly the second offence involves the injury inflicted but that is part of the statutory aggravation. The wounds whilst serious, were not life threatening although they are likely to leave lifelong scars. Ultimately, each of the offences was serious but in my view, they are not ones that attract the standard non-parole periods.”


	
	His Honour then turned to subjective matters. He observed that Mr Miller was much younger than his co-offenders, Mr Mallon, who was in his early 30s and Mr Ford, who was 41. Mr Miller was 20 when he committed these offences.
	
	
	His Honour found that Mr Miller’s substantial criminal record did not, however, permit a lenient approach in his sentencing exercise. That conclusion reflected that Mr Miller had a lengthy and serious juvenile record and was on conditional liberty for prior offending, when he committed these offences. He was also on a s 9 bond. This was properly considered to be an aggravating matter under s 21A(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.
	
	
	His Honour also observed that Mr Miller’s offending had continued into adulthood, despite warnings he no doubt received, as to the penalties which would apply, if his offending continued. In the result Blackmore DCJ concluded that Mr Miller had to be sentenced as an adult and that while an offender of his age would usually attract a discount for youth, to encourage rehabilitation, in the face of Mr Miller’s record, “the prospect of rehabilitation must necessarily take on a lesser role”.
	
	
	His Honour also took the view that considerations of specific deterrence, retribution and protection of the community, had to be emphasised by the sentences imposed upon Mr Miller.
	
	
	His Honour then turned to the Probation and Parole report and a psychologist's report in evidence. He observed:
	


“The offender reported a difficult upbringing in a house where violence was common. He was expelled from school for violent behaviour. He started using drugs and alcohol from around the age of 14. His juvenile criminal record bespeaks of his history. He was a disruptive and violent child who has now emerged as a violent drug addicted adult. Based on his history to date, there are no reasonable prospects of rehabilitation.”


	
	Mr Miller’s case on appeal was that his Honour had failed to have proper regard to the detailed information led as to his deprived background and extreme deprivation, considerably more serious than the mere description, ‘difficult upbringing’, encompassed.
	
	
	The result of his Honour’s approach was submitted to be that Mr Miller did not have the benefit of a finding of good prospects of rehabilitation, which should have been made had proper account been taken of this evidence. It was also submitted that the fact that the same aggregate sentences were imposed on all three offenders, despite Mr Miller’s very different circumstances, revealed error of the kind identified in Bugmy. There it was observed at [44] - [45]:
	


“44.   Because the effects of profound childhood deprivation do not diminish with the passage of time and repeated offending, it is right to speak of giving ""full weight"" to an offender's deprived background in every sentencing decision. However, this is not to suggest, as the appellant's submissions were apt to do, that an offender's deprived background has the same (mitigatory) relevance for all of the purposes of punishment. Giving weight to the conflicting purposes of punishment is what makes the exercise of the discretion so difficult [Veen v The Queen [No 2] (1988) 164 CLR 465 at 476 per Mason CJ, Brennan, Dawson and Toohey JJ; [1988] HCA 14.]. An offender's childhood exposure to extreme violence and alcohol abuse may explain the offender's recourse to violence when frustrated such that the offender's moral culpability for the inability to control that impulse may be substantially reduced. However, the inability to control the violent response to frustration may increase the importance of protecting the community from the offender.

45.   The point was made by Gleeson CJ in R v Engert in the context of explaining the significance of an offender's mental condition in sentencing [(1995) 84 A Crim R 67 at 68.]:

""A moment's consideration will show that the interplay of the considerations relevant to sentencing may be complex and on occasion even intricate. In a given case, facts which point in one direction in relation to one of the considerations to be taken into account may point in a different direction in relation to some other consideration. For example, in the case of a particular offender, an aspect of the case which might mean that deterrence of others is of lesser importance, might, at the same time, mean that the protection of society is of greater importance. That was the particular problem being examined by the court in the case of Veen [No 2]. Again, in a particular case, a feature which lessens what might otherwise be the importance of general deterrence, might, at the same time increase the importance of deterrence of the offender.""


	
	The Crown did not concede these alleged errors, submitting that Blackmore DCJ had made appropriate reference to the relevant evidence, on which it was open to his Honour to conclude that there was an increased need to consider deterrence and protection of the community, in Mr Miller’s case.
	
	
	There was plainly no error in his Honour’s conclusions as to the nature and seriousness of this offending and there is force in the Crown’s case in relation to deterrence. However, given that Mr Miller was a young offender with a significant criminal record on conditional liberty at the time of his offending, as he was, it is my view that his Honour fell into error of the kind discussed in Bugmy. The result is that what is required to be achieved in every sentencing exercise, individualised justice, was not achieved in Mr Miller’s case.
	
	
	As the Crown submitted, both deterrence and protection of the community had to be considered in Mr Miller’s case, in determining the sentence to be imposed upon him, given the nature and seriousness of his offences. Nevertheless in his case, proper account also had to be taken of the evidence as to the effect of his youth, his deprived background and his very difficult upbringing and its ongoing consequences. Despite that evidence, his Honour, came to the same conclusion in relation to all three offenders, their moral culpability for their respective offending, their prospects of rehabilitation and the role which deterrence had to play in the sentence imposed on each of them.
	
	
	These conclusions revealed the error into which his Honour fell.
	
	
	While all three offenders had considerable records, it was relevant that Mr Miller’s juvenile record in South Australia was for offences including theft and possession of firearms, assault, damage property, dishonestly taking property, trespass, drug offences, graffiti, interfering with motor vehicles, driving offences and drug offences, as well as breaches of bail. He had not, however, yet served any custodial sentence.
	
	
	Given Mr Miller was aged only 20 years at the time of his offence, his age was one important distinguishing factor in this sentencing exercise, given the age of his considerably older and more mature co-offenders, as was the evidence of his background and its effects on his functioning.
	
	
	Proper attention was not given to this evidence, even though the capacity for young people to reform and mould their character to conform to society’s norms, by comparison to older offenders, has repeatedly been recognised. In the result, considerable emphasis has been placed on the need to provide them with the opportunity for rehabilitation (see R v GDP (1991) 53 A Crim R 112 at 115-116 (NSWCCA), R v E (a child) (1993) 66 A Crim R 14 at 28 (WACCA) and R v Adamson [2002] NSWCCA 349; (2002) 132 A Crim R 511 at [30].) Thus, in the case of offenders under 21 years of age, the Court may direct that the whole or any part of the term of sentence imposed for an indictable offence, be served as a juvenile offender: s 19(1) of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 (NSW).
	
	
	It is also well settled that the law recognises the potential for the cognitive, emotional and/or psychological immaturity of a young person, to contribute to their breach of the law (see KT v The Queen [2008] NSWCCCA 51; (2008) 182 A Crim R 571 at [23]). Further, an offender‘s mental health problems need not amount to a serious psychiatric illness, before they will be relevant on sentencing. The circumstances may also indicate that a mental disorder of modest severity, may moderate the need for general or specific deterrence (see Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194; (2010) 79 NSWLR 1 at [178]).
	
	
	The greater the objective gravity of an offence, the less likely it is that retribution and general deterrence will cede to the interests of rehabilitation (see IE v The Queen [2008] NSWCCA 70; (2008) 183 A Crim R 150 at [16]; MJ v R [2010] NSWCCA 52 at [37] - [39]; and JT v R [2011] NSWCCA 128 at [34] - [35].)
	
	
	Even so, in assessing moral culpability for particular offending and considering whether special circumstances should be found, real consideration must be given to evidence of a disadvantaged background, such as that which it was not disputed that Mr Miller had suffered.
	
	
	As discussed in Bugmy at [42] - [43] where an offender relies on a background of deprivation in mitigation of sentence, it is necessary to consider the material tending to establish that background, accepting that the “the effects of profound deprivation do not diminish over time” and that they must be “given full weight in the determination of the appropriate sentence in every case”.”
	
	
	If such evidence is not to be accepted as having any relevant impact on the sentence to be imposed on a young offender such as Mr Miller, compared to considerably older and more experienced co-offenders, a proper explanation for the conclusion reached should be given.
	
	
	In Mr Miller’s case, the Justice Health report given by Dr Clark noted that he had lived in Broken Hill, where he had been born, for only 6 weeks before he committed these offences, having moved there from Adelaide, he said, in order to get away from drug associates and the trouble he was getting into there.
	
	
	Mr Miller had never known his father, who was Italian. His mother was Australian. He lived with his grandmother when aged 8, when his mother was gaoled for fraud. He had long term problems with anger management, drug abuse and offending.
	
	
	Mr Miller had been physically and sexually abused by his stepfather, between the ages of 10 and 12 years. He lived with his mother in Adelaide from age 12. She was a drug user and there was often no food. After 12 months he left her to live with friends and in hostels. He had been placed in classes for slow learners. He left school in Year 8, after having fights and conflicts there.
	
	
	Mr Miller had no history of medical psychiatric treatment, except when in custody. He described himself as a “clean freak”, who had some past physical problems with a shoulder injury and hernia. Mr Miller also denied past treatment for schizophrenia, but a nursing record noted that he was on medication for that condition.
	
	
	Mr Miller had been a heavy cannabis user and had experienced suspicious and paranoid thoughts about others, from age 15 or 16. They had lessened over time and ceased when he stopped using cannabis, he said, about a year before these offences. Mr Miller reported that his cannabis use had commenced at age 12 and he had begun drinking alcohol at age 13. Before stopping using cannabis, he was smoking daily. His alcohol abuse had contributed to his stealing behaviour, but he denied other drug use.
	
	
	While living in hostels he said that he had spent the day engaged in shoplifting and other criminal behaviour, in order to support himself and his drinking habit. There was little evidence of gainful employment. Mr Miller claimed to have been pressured into committing these offences, having been drinking heavily that night.
	
	
	No mental illness was identified in this report, but counselling and psychotherapy were recommended for his alcohol and anger problems, anxiety and mild paranoia, physical and sexual abuse, as well as vocational assistance. He was considered to be potentially vulnerable and subject to exploitation by others.
	
	
	The pre-sentence report noted a similar history given as to Mr Miller’s background, apart from references to his having stayed in youth refuges and with foster carers, under the supervision of the Child Protection Service, from age 13. Violent tendencies in community settings, school and home were, however, also identified. It was also noted that sound levels of literacy skills had been reported after his attendance at TAFE classes in literacy and numeracy.
	
	
	It was also noted that Mr Miller had demonstrated remorse for his offences and towards his victims. Vocational training and assessment for mental health, physical health, drug and alcohol intervention, anger management and job seek assistance were recommended.
	
	
	On sentencing it was argued that these reports provided some basis for cautious optimism in Mr Miller’s case, reflecting as they did on his part, a desire to pursue rehabilitation, not present in the past. It was submitted to be relevant that he was substantially younger than the other offenders, being only just an adult, although with a significant juvenile record in South Australia. He had not, however, served a custodial sentence. That he was on conditional liberty at the time of these offences was conceded also to be relevant, but in the result, a finding of special circumstances was sought in his case, with only limited accumulation on the two offences.
	
	
	That was not accepted by the Crown, given the serious nature of Mr Miller’s offending, which, it was submitted, involved home invasions and gratuitous cruelty in the wounding of Mr Whitfield. Mr Miller was then inside, armed with a knife, although it was not apparent that it was he who used the knife to cut Mr Whitfield. In the result, some accumulation was urged.
	
	
	His Honour accepted the case which the Crown advanced, imposing identical sentences on all three offenders, taking the view, however, that while serious, they did not attract the standard non-parole period.
	
	
	While in Mr Miller’s case, he had a record as a juvenile, with no prior custodial sentence, nevertheless, his Honour concluded that rehabilitation also had to take a lesser role in his sentence. He also considered that specific deterrence, retribution and protection of the community, also had to be emphasised in his case in the same way as in the case of the two co-offenders.
	
	
	These conclusions were reached in circumstances where, in Mr Mallon’s case his Honour noted an abusive childhood, time spent in care as a child, leaving school in Year 7, but later lengthy periods of employment. He had a lengthy history of drug abuse, having had a heroin addiction for the past 3 years, although the reports indicated some scepticism about that claim. He was reported to be entrenched in drug society, with a long term history of drug use and a misconception of appropriate behaviour, given his claims that they were only breaking into dealers’ houses.
	
	
	Despite this record, his Honour concluded that Mr Mallon had guarded prospects of rehabilitation, given his record of past employment, family responsibilities, which might give him motivation to change and give up drug use.
	
	
	In Mr Ford’s case, his Honour noted that reports in evidence revealed a long history of drug abuse and failed attempts in the past at drug rehabilitation. His Honour rejected a submission that he had reached an age and stage in life when he had decided he must change.
	
	
	Psychiatric reports noted that Mr Ford had schizotypal personality traits, whether the result of long term drug use, or an underlying mental condition. He had a personality disorder with antisocial and borderline traits. He was unwilling to undertake serious drug rehabilitation involving long term abstinence and there was no evidence of any treatment while in custody. His Honour found that he had limited prospects of rehabilitation.
	
	
	It is apparent from his Honour’s remarks that the result of the approach adopted was not the individualised justice discussed in Bugmy. The same sentence as that imposed on the co-offenders was not warranted in Mr Miller’s case, given his age, differing circumstances and prospects of rehabilitation, which could not on the evidence be concluded to be as limited as those of his co-offenders, given their respective ages, backgrounds and adult offending.
	
	
	The ongoing effects of Mr Miller’s more recent, deprived background had to be given proper weight. It had certainly not had time to diminish, given his age, even were that possible, given the nature of that deprivation. Given that background and Mr Miller’s youth, rehabilitation had to play a greater role in the sentence imposed upon him, than was available in the cases of his co-offenders, even though all three offenders were involved in the same serious offending.
	
	
	In the result, I consider that this appeal must be upheld and Mr Miller resentenced. In that exercise, deterrence, both general and specific still have a role to play, as does punishment for Mr Miller’s serious offences.
	
	
	Mr Miller must, however, have a finding of special circumstances, requiring as he does a longer period of supervision, once released on parole, than the usual ratio would provide, given his desire to remain drug and alcohol free and to gain control over his anger management problems, with which he requires ongoing assistance.
	


Resentence


	
	In the result I would resentence Mr Miller to an aggregate sentence of 7 years imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 4 years 9 months, commencing on 2 September 2013, that reflecting, after discount, partially accumulated indicative individual sentences of imprisonment of 5 years, with a non-parole period of 3 years for count 1 and imprisonment for 6 years, with a non-parole period of 3 years and 10 months for count 2.
	


Orders


	
	The orders I would propose are:
	



	
	Leave to appeal is refused in relation to grounds 1 and 3.
	
	
	Leave to appeal is granted in relation to grounds 2 and 4.
	
	
	The appeal is upheld.
	
	
	The sentences are set aside.
	
	
	Mr Miller is resentenced to an aggregate sentence of 7 years imprisonment, commencing on 2 September 2013, and expiring on 1 September 2020, with a non-parole period of 4 years 9 months, expiring on 1 June 2018.

	MEAGHER JA: I agree with Schmidt J that the objective circumstances of the offending of each of the applicants and their respective subjective cases, as found by the same sentencing judge, were sufficiently different from those of Bing-Jie Wang to justify the disparity in the sentences each received. For the reasons her Honour gives, leave to appeal should be granted and their appeals dismissed.
	
	
	SCHMIDT J: Mr Chun Lok Lam and his younger brother, Mr Chun Kit Lam, each seek leave to appeal sentences imposed on them by McClintock DCJ in April 2014, for an offence under s 25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW) of supplying a large commercial quantity of a prohibited drug (namely, 2206.7 grams of methylamphetamine). That offence carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment and/or a fine of $550,000 with a standard non-parole period of 15 years for a mid-range offence.
	
	
	There is only one ground of appeal advanced in each case, namely, that each applicant has a justifiable sense of grievance by virtue of the disparity between the sentence imposed on him and that imposed upon the co-offender, Mr Bing-Jie Wang.
	
	
	Both applicants had pleaded guilty and were sentenced by McClintock DCJ, after a 15 % discount as follows:
	



	
	Chun Lok Lam - a total term of imprisonment of 6 years and 9 months to commence on 25 September 2013 and to expire on 24 June 2020, with a non-parole period of 4 years and 6 months.
	
	
	Chun Kit Lam - a total term of imprisonment of 5 years to commence on 9 December 2013 and to expire on 8 December 2018, with a non-parole period of 3 years.
	



	
	The methylamphetamine the subject of the offences to which the three co-offenders entered their pleas was found by Australian Federal Police on 8 May 2012 at Wolli Creek, at Mr Bing-Jie Wang’s residence. In April 2013, he pleaded guilty to two offences:
	



	
	Possession of a substance reasonably suspected of being unlawfully imported, namely, a marketable quantity of heroin (495.8 grams pure and net weight of 694.5 grams) under s 307.9 of the Criminal Code (Cth). This offence carries a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment or 5000 penalty units or both.
	
	
	Supply of a large commercial quantity of a prohibited drug, namely, 2,227.9 grams of methylamphetamine under s 25(2) and s 29 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act. (This related to the same drugs in respect of which the two applicants entered their plea, although the quantity recorded was slightly different.) This offence carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment or 5000 penalty units or both.
	



	
	Bing-Jie Wang also asked that on sentencing, two additional offences be taken into account under s 16BA of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth):
	



	
	Possession of a marketable quantity of a border controlled drug (32.6 grams of cocaine) under s 307.9 of the Criminal Code.
	
	
	Recklessly dealing with the proceeds of crime ($36,000) under s 400.6(2) of the Criminal Code.
	



	
	Bing-Jie Wang was sentenced on 4 April 2013 by McClintock DCJ to a total term of imprisonment of 5 years with a non-parole period of 2 years and 6 months for his offences, the two sentences being made wholly concurrent. This sentence, it was argued on appeal, was not commensurate with the additional serious charge for which Bing-Jie Wang was sentenced. Further, it was argued that given the serious nature of the form 1 offences, there had to be a substantial increase in the sentence imposed on him (see R v Grube [2005] NSWCCA 140 at [20]).
	
	
	In Mr Chun Kit Lam’s case it was also submitted that an additional offence under s 93TA of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) of deriving a material benefit from a criminal group, the maximum penalty for which was 5 years imprisonment, was taken into account on sentencing him on a Form 1. That was disputed by the Crown.
	
	
	On 7 February 2013, Mr Corr appearing for the Crown, said that there would be no further proceedings on that charge. The Crown’s case was that the charge was not later referred to on sentencing. It was remitted to the Local Court and later withdrawn.
	
	
	If that offence had been dealt with on a Form 1, the result would have been that a heavier sentence had to be imposed on Mr Chun Kit Lam for his offence (see Attorney General’s Application under s 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 No 1 of 2002 [2002] NSWCCA 518; (2002) 56 NSWLR 146 at [42]; Abbas, Bodiotis, Taleb and Amoun v R [2013] NSWCCA 115 at [23]).
	


Disparity in Sentencing


	
	In order to determine whether there is unjustifiable disparity, and a justifiable sense of grievance, or the appearance that justice has not been done, what must be considered is what was discussed in Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; (2011) 244 CLR 462 at [32]:
	


“A court of criminal appeal deciding an appeal against the severity of a sentence on the ground of unjustified disparity will have regard to the qualitative and discretionary judgments required of the primary judge in drawing distinctions between co-offenders. Where there is a marked disparity between sentences giving rise to the appearance of injustice, it is not a necessary condition of a court of criminal appeal's discretion to intervene that the sentence under appeal is otherwise excessive. Disparity can be an indicator of appealable error [Lowe v The Queen (1984) 154 CLR 606 at 617-618 per Brennan J; Postiglione v The Queen (1997) 189 CLR 295 at 301 per Dawson and Gaudron JJ.]. It is also correct, as Mason J said in Lowe, that logic and reality combine to favour the proposition that discrepancy is a ground for intervention in itself [(1984) 154 CLR 606 at 613.]. Unjustifiable disparity is an infringement of the equal justice norm. It is appealable error, although it may not always lead to an appeal being allowed. If an appeal is allowed on the ground of disparity, a court of criminal appeal in re-sentencing is not required to achieve identity of punishment. It must have regard to the sentence imposed on the co-offender and give it appropriate weight [R v Kucharski unreported, Supreme Court of Victoria Court of Appeal, 23 June 1997 at 10 per Hayne JA, Brooking JA and Ashley AJA agreeing at 11.]. In such a case, an appeal to this Court on the question whether a disparity identified in a court of criminal appeal was unjustifiable and called for intervention by that court would also involve review of a qualitative and discretionary judgment [Lowe v The Queen (1984) 154 CLR 606 at 610 per Gibbs CJ, Wilson J agreeing at 616.]”


	
	As discussed in Tatana v Regina [2006] NSWCCA 398 at [28], an offender faces considerable obstacles, when a sentencing judge is fully aware of sentences imposed upon co-offenders, the reasons for those sentences, and explains why the sentences imposed upon them, are departed from. Here the differences in the sentences imposed on the three offenders were the result of legitimate fact finding by the one sentencing judge and the exercise of discretions in relation to the utilitarian discount and the finding of special circumstances in each case. As discussed in R v Do [2005] NSWCCA 209 at [17] – [19], different findings in relation to such discounts cannot readily give rise to a conclusion that disparity has resulted.
	
	
	For reasons which follow, in my view, disparity not been established in either case, with the result that while I consider leave to appeal must be allowed, the appeals must both be dismissed.
	


The offences

Chun Kit Lam


	
	There had been an AFP investigation into this drug operation during which the three offenders, were implicated in drug supply, as the result of telephone intercepts, physical surveillance and fingerprints.
	
	
	There were agreed facts tendered in each case, but not a great deal was revealed about the operation of the drug syndicate in which the three offenders were involved. None of the three offenders gave evidence on sentencing. The applicants’ mother gave evidence at their sentencing hearing.
	
	
	Chun Kit Lam was aged 19 years at the time of his offence. He was 6 months older than Bing-Jie Wang and 20 months younger than his brother. The brothers were Chinese nationals, resident in Hong Kong, and had been in Australia for some time, on student visas. They were both arrested on 19 May 2012. Chun Kit Lam was released on bail on 26 July 2012 and Chun Lok Lam on 17 September.
	
	
	The methylamphetamine was found at Bing-Jie Wang’s apartment, where he lived with his girlfriend. The second bedroom had been set up for drug supply. A cutting agent, table, electrical scales, resealable plastic bags, bowls, disposable gloves and other drugs not related to the charge to which the applicants entered their pleas, were found there.
	
	
	After search of their residence at Denistone, Chun Kit Lam was found to have leased the premises at Wolli Creek. He was not living there, but knew they were being used for drug use and supply. Phone intercepts revealed that he took direction from his older brother and others and may have been involved in delivery of certain items, the contents of which were not known to police. He also passed messages between his brother and Bing-Jie Wang and others higher in the syndicate. He attended the Wolli Creek premises with his brother on 10 days between 16 April and May 2012 and was observed carrying boxes and bags out of the premises.
	
	
	Chun Kit Lam’s fingerprints were found on only one of the bags of methylamphetamine found on execution of the search warrant at Wolli Creek. The extent of his knowledge of the quantity of the drugs found there was unknown, but his plea amounted to an admission that he knew the amount involved was substantial, his Honour concluded. It amounted to a supply of some 2.2 kilos of methylamphetamine.
	
	
	In his sentencing remarks McClintock DCJ accepted the Crown’s position that Chun Kit Lam was less culpable than his brother. He acted as his brother’s assistant in performing relatively menial tasks associated with the supply. His name on the lease exposed him to easy detection. Neither he nor his brother were principals but his plea indicated his knowledge and participation in a substantial commercial operation.
	


Chun Lok Lam


	
	The facts agreed in Chun Lok Lam’s case were different. The common elements related to the Wolli Creek premises, where he was also a frequent visitor; what was found on execution of the search warrant; and his detection during the course of the AFP investigation.
	
	
	He was arrested with his brother on search of their premises at Denistone.
	
	
	Fingerprint evidence at the Wolli Creek premises also showed that he had handled one bag of the methylamphetamine and his fingerprints were also found on a box of snap lock bags and a bench there.
	
	
	McClintock DCJ also concluded that Chun Lok Lam’s plea involved an admission that he knew that the amount of drugs involved was substantial. His Honour found that he was not the principal in the operation, but he was above Chun Kit Lam and Bing-Jie Wang. He was an intermediary, passing on messages to others in the group and directing Chun Kit Lam and Bing-Jie Wang.
	


Chun Kit Lam – no disparity


	
	A complaint of disparity proceeds on the basis of an acceptance that the sentence is otherwise appropriate, as was acknowledged on appeal (see England v R; Phanith v R [2009] NSWCCA 274 at [22]).
	
	
	In order to make out his appeal, Chun Kit Lam must establish that the sentence imposed upon him was not justified by any differences in the objective circumstances of his offending, compared to that of Bing-Jie Wang, or in their respective subjective cases. As discussed in Lowe v The Queen [1984] HCA 46; (1984) 154 CLR 606 at 623:
	


“There is no rule of law which requires co-offenders to be given the same sentence for the same offence even if no distinction can be drawn between them. Obviously where the circumstances of each offender or his involvement in the offence are different then different sentences may be called for but justice should be even-handed and it has come to be recognised both here and in England that any difference between the sentences imposed upon co-offenders for the same offence ought not to be such as to give rise to a justifiable sense of a grievance on the part of the offender with the heavier sentence or to give the appearance that justice has not been done.”


	
	An appeal such as this is not concerned with an offender’s feelings, but with objective criteria and the consistent application of the applicable sentencing principles (see Green v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; 244 CLR 462 at [31] and Hili v R; Jones v R [2010] HCA 45; (2010) 242 CLR 520 at [77] - [78]). Disparity in sentencing is not simply the imposition of different sentences for the same offence, but a question of disproportion between them. Parity must be determined by having regard to the circumstances of the co-offenders and their respective degrees of culpability for their offending (see Postiglione v The Queen [1997] HCA 26; (1997) 189 CLR 295 at 878).
	
	
	Here Chun Kit Lam’s case on appeal was that the factual material led on his sentencing had revealed little as to the actual role which he and his brother had played in the drug operation in which they were involved with Bing-Jie Wang. That, of course, was information which lay in their hands, but was not dealt with in the agreed facts. On sentencing, the Crown did not contradict the submission which Chun Kit Lam then advanced that there was no evidence that he was operating at a higher level than Bing-Jie Wang. McClintock DCJ accepted that submission, concluding that objectively, his role and that of Bing-Jie Wang were similar.
	
	
	Chun Kit Lam’s complaint on appeal was that despite the more serious charges for which Bing-Jie Wang was sentenced, he received a lighter sentence. His case was that this was not explained by their respective roles in this drug operation; or by the fact that Bing-Jie Wang had received a 25% discount for his earlier plea, while Chun Kit Lam had received only a 15% discount; or by their respective subjective circumstances.
	
	
	Chun Kit Lam argued that principles of parity, equal justice and proportionality had required that McClintock DCJ take proper account of the more serious offence sentenced along with the matters in the Form 1 for which Bing-Jie Wang had been sentenced, with the result that the starting point for his sentence had to be lower than that of Bing-Jie Wang, “unless there’s something quite extraordinary which distinguishes their cases”. It was also submitted that there was nothing in Bing-Jie Wang’s subjective case, which so distinguished him and that McClintock DCJ had erred, when he observed in his sentencing remarks that :
	


“There is little in the objective circumstances that is different. I accept that Mr Wang was charged with more serious offences. It was not put to me that I should give less to Kit but rather that there should be a parity in the overall sentence. It was not put to me that the sentence should be less than that of Wang.”


	
	That observation, it must be accepted, was incorrect.
	
	
	Each of the three offenders who McClintock DCJ sentenced was young and had no prior criminal record. Each was charged with offences in respect of the methylamphetamine found at the apartment which Chun Kit Lam leased and where Bing-Jie Wang lived with his girlfriend. Chun Kit Lam and Bing-Jie Wang were both involved in this drug syndicate, at a similar level. Chun Lok Lam was higher in the drug hierarchy. In arriving at the respective sentences, his Honour had to consider not only the nature and seriousness of their respective offending, he had to have regard to each offender’s subjective circumstances, as well as other relevant considerations.
	
	
	Chun Kit Lam’s case was that his sentence should have been less than that of Bing Jai Wang given, amongst other things, the other offences for which he was being sentenced. The result was, it was argued, that Chun Kit Lam had been left with a justifiable sense of grievance at the heavier sentence imposed upon him.
	
	
	The Crown did not concede that McClintock DCJ had erred in the sentence imposed on Chun Kit Lam, despite the erroneous reference to the case that had been advanced for him on sentencing; or that a basis for that claimed sense of grievance had been established.
	
	
	Its case was that the sentencing exercise for Bing-Jie Wang has in fact commenced with a higher total sentence than that imposed on Chun Kit Lam, as he has submitted ought to have occurred. Chun Kit Lam’s real complaint, it was argued, in those circumstances was that concurrent sentences had been imposed on Bing-Jie Wang. For reasons explained by McClintock DCJ, there has been no error in that conclusion.
	
	
	The Crown’s submissions must be accepted.
	
	
	As discussed in Tan v R [2014] NSWCCA 96 at [38] - [41], where one sentencing judge has sentenced co-offenders, an appeal court must be cautious before concluding that differing sentencing outcomes have resulted in a justifiable sense of grievance. Gross, marked or glaring disparity must be shown in order for this ground of appeal to be established (see England v R; Phanith v R at [61] - [67]). No such disparity here exists.
	
	
	The maximum penalty for Chun Kit Lam’s offence was life imprisonment and for a mid-range offence, a 15 year standard non-parole period applied. These were both statutory guideposts which also had to be taken into account in this sentencing exercise (see Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CLR 120 at [27]).
	
	
	Chun Kit Lam’s sentence commenced with a considerably lower sentence than that imposed on Bing-Jie Wang. While not referred to in the sentencing remarks, McClintock DCJ began that sentencing exercise with a sentence of 5 years and 11 months (not the 5 years and 7 months calculated by the Crown by reference to a 10% discount), with a non-parole period of 3 years and 6 months. After a 15% discount, he was sentenced to a total term of 5 years, with a non-parole period of 3 years.
	
	
	By comparison, the starting point for Bing-Jie Wang’s sentence was considerably higher , namely a higher sentence of 6 years and 8 months, with a non-parole period of 3 years and 4 months. After a 25% discount, the sentence imposed upon him was 5 years, with a non-parole period of 2 years and 6 months.
	
	
	The sentence imposed in Bing-Jie Wang’s case had been partly the result of the application of the principal of totality, and partly the result of the findings as to of special circumstances and discount partly the result of the conclusion that the sentences imposed upon him should be made completely concurrent.
	
	
	Those conclusions were not challenged on appeal by the Crown. They were, however, challenged by Chun Kit Lam, on this appeal.
	
	
	As to totality, his Honour took the view that the sentences he imposed on Bing-Jie Wang should be served concurrently, the offences for which he was being sentenced being all part of the same criminality, notwithstanding that different drugs were involved and a different sentencing regime applied to the offences. He considered that the two offences were effectively on the same side of the coin in supplying drugs as a commercial venture.
	
	
	The question of whether sentences should be served concurrently involves discretionary considerations, which must be resolved by a sentencing judge by reference to the principles discussed, for example, in R v XX [2009] NSWCCA 115; (2009) 195 A Crim R 38 at [52]; Cahyadi v The Queen [2007] NSWCCA 1; (2007) 168 A Crim R 41 and Nguyen v R [2007] NSWCCA 14.
	
	
	The case here advanced for Chun Kit Lam did not establish that McClintock DCJ erred in the conclusions which he reached as to those considerations, or that the result did not properly reflect the totality of the criminality for which he was being sentenced (see R v Wilson [2005] NSWCCA 219 at [38]).
	
	
	Overall, the supply offences to which Bing-Jie Wang entered pleas were more serious and warranted a greater overall sentence than that imposed on Chun Kit Lam, particularly given that two other offences had to be taken into account on a Form 1 in Bing-Jie Wang’s case. That was why McClintock DCJ’s overall starting point for Bing-Jie Wang’s offence was higher, that is, 6 years and 8 months, rather than 5 years and 11 months.
	
	
	By comparison, the conclusions reached by McClintock DCJ in Chun Kit Lam’s case were not only the result of a consideration of his offending and subjective circumstances, but also partly the result of the application of the principle of parity and the different findings reached as to special circumstances and discount.
	
	
	His Honour’s parity considerations resulted in a considerably lower starting point for Chun Kit Lam, than that adopted for either Bing-Jie Wang or his brother.
	
	
	His Honour had regard to certain similarities between Bing-Jie Wang and Chun Kit Lam, including their age and that they were both addicted to methylamphetamine. There was evidence that they were both under some financial duress, although McClintock DCJ had doubts about that in Bing-Jie Wang’s case, given what was found at his apartment, which included a BMW provided for his use. Addiction to drugs is generally not, however, of itself, a matter of mitigation at sentence (see R v Henry [1999] NSWCCA 111; (1999) 46 NSWLR 346 at [178]). They were also both found to be remorseful, at low risk of re-offending and with good prospects of rehabilitation, Bing-Jie Wang being found to have a “very low risk” of re-offending.
	
	
	It was also necessary for his Honour to consider the significant differences in other aspects of the offenders’ backgrounds.
	
	
	Bing-Jie Wang had a very disadvantaged background, having been forced from home when aged 15 years. On his mother’s evidence Chun Kit Lam had a comfortable, relatively privileged upbringing. Bing-Jie Wang was found to be suffering a major depressive disorder and Chun Kit Lam to be suffering some psychotic symptoms. In the result, special circumstances were found in each case.
	
	
	Bing-Jie Wang was sentenced first. McClintock DCJ thus had to consider the question of parity, when sentencing Chun Kit Lam. His Honour explained that he considered that in all of the circumstances, Chun Kit Lam would have a justifiable sense of grievance, if there were a significant disparity between his sentence and that imposed on Bing-Jie Wang. His Honour also observed, however, that Chun Kit Lam’s subjective case was not as compelling as that of Bing-Jie Wang, because he did not suffer the deprivation that Bing-Jie Wang had suffered.
	
	
	There was no error in those views being taken. They accorded with the evidence.
	
	
	The finding of special circumstances in Bing-Jie Wang’s case resulted in a non-parole period fixed at 50% of the total sentence. In Chun Kit Lam’s case that finding resulted in a non-parole period fixed at 60% of the total sentence. As discussed in R v Cramp [2004] NSWCCA 264 at [31], the size of an adjustment for special circumstances raises so many matters of a discretionary character, that this Court “should be very slow to intervene” on an appeal such as this.
	
	
	The finding as to special circumstances for Bing-Jie Wang rested on evidence that a large number of factors had affected his maturation, including his lack of early parental affection, assistance, guidance, what would otherwise be regarded as warm family life. He was not wanted by his relatives in China, was sent to Australia, where he was also not wanted and, his Honour found, became a kind of refugee from family life. He had no guidance and a reduced ability to comprehend issues of criminality and a reduced capacity to resist criminal temptation and the temptation of the quick and easy reward which accommodation and transport provided him. In the result, his Honour concluded that there was a significant need for rehabilitation and longer than usual supervision after release in his case, with the support of the Probation and Parole Service, as well as ongoing psychological guidance, if he was not to relapse into further offending. This evidence was also relevant to an assessment of Bing-Jie Wang’s moral culpability for his offending.
	
	
	Chun Kit Lam did not challenge his Honour’s conclusions as to his own circumstances, which were also found to warrant a finding of special circumstances and were relevant to an assessment of his moral culpability for his offending.
	
	
	These findings reflected the conclusions his Honour reached about the offenders’ respective subjective circumstances and need for supervision, once released on parole. There was no suggestion that his Honour erred in reaching these conclusions, other than in the overall result, which left Chun Kit Lam in the position where he must serve a longer non-parole period of some 3 years, rather than the 2 years and 6 months which Bing-Jie Wang must serve, before becoming eligible for parole.
	
	
	Chun Kit Lam’s circumstances were markedly different to those of Bing-Jie Wang. He did not have a deprived background. McClintock DCJ found, however, that Chun Kit Lam was significantly immature, his mother’s evidence demonstrating that he was ill equipped to come to Australia alone, at such an early age. His Honour adopted a similar approach to his youth and the question of general deterrence as he had in Bing-Jie Wang’s case, although to a lesser degree, given that Chun Kit Lam was 6 months older than Bing-Jie Wang. He accepted, however, that Chun Kit Lam was also vulnerable and not capable of mature consideration.
	
	
	In evidence in Chun Kit Lam’s case, was a psychologist’s report, which noted that he had a significant drug addiction and had been arrested, after having completed two years of business studies in Australia, despite having a relatively poor command of English. Chun Kit Lam reported that he had not lived with his brother when he came to Australia and had experienced difficulty with separation from his family and adjusting to life here. He had drifted into a pattern of alcohol abuse, to the point of blackout and then drug abuse, to the point of profound impact on his judgment. He was found to have symptoms of major depression and anxiety, consistent with his circumstances, which required treatment.
	
	
	While his Honour considered that, in combination, Bing-Jie Wang’s offending was more serious than and arose from a similar role and status to that, of Chun Kit Lam, he also considered that Chun Kit Lam’s background did not exhibit the same level of deprivation. He found there was no explanation for how he had become involved in this offending, apart from his addiction and his relationship with his brother.
	
	
	The result of all of these conclusions was a sentence imposed on Chun Kit Lam which began at a considerable lower starting point than that adopted in Bing-Jie Wang’s case, for his supply offence. Because of the higher utilitarian discount Bing-Jie received, as well as the conclusions reached in relation to the findings of special circumstances, the result was that the sentence imposed on Chun Kit Lam was longer. He must serve 6 months longer than Bing-Jie Wang, before he becomes eligible for parole.
	
	
	There was no error in that result, given the relevant differences between the two offenders. It reflects relevant differences which form the basis of qualitative and discretionary judgments made in each case (see Green at [31]-[32]).
	
	
	Even if it were to be concluded that the overall sentence imposed upon Bing-Jie Wang was too low, of itself, that would not necessarily be a sufficient basis on which to uphold this appeal.
	
	
	The discretion to reduce a sentence to a less than an adequate level, if it exists, does not require Chun Kim Lam’s sentence to be reduced on appeal to a level which would be “an affront to the proper administration of justice”, given the offence for which he was sentenced (see Green at [33]).
	
	
	The non-parole period imposed on Chun Kit Lam is the minimum period of actual incarceration that he must spend in full-time custody, having regard to all the elements of punishment, including rehabilitation, the objective seriousness of his crime and his subjective circumstances (see Power v The Queen [1974] HCA 26; (1974) 131 CLR 62 at 628–629). That period must adequately reflect his moral culpability for his offending (see GN v R [2012] NSWCCA 96 at [12]; McLaren v R [2012] NSWCCA 284 at [28] - [29]).
	
	
	The result of the exercise of the sentencing discretion in Chun Kit Lam’s case was plainly not a heavy sentence, given the seriousness of his offence and his moral culpability for that offending, involving as it did, his part in the operation of this significant drug syndicate, which included his admitted involvement in the supply of a large commercial quantity, over 2.2 kilos, of methylamphetamine. The quantity of the drugs involved was one consideration in this sentencing exercise, as was the role which Chun Kit Lam played. That not much was known about his role did not oblige McClintock DCJ to find facts favourable to Chun Kim Lam, although his Honour plainly did take a view which favoured him (see R v Olbrich [1999] HCA 54; (1999) 199 CLR 270 at [27] - [28]).
	
	
	Further, his Honour had to bear in mind, as discussed in R v Shi [2004] NSWCCA 135, Wood CJ at CL, at [34] the importance of giving consideration to:
	


“… the well-recognised principle that the culpability of those who engage, at any level, in drug supply networks is significant, and that deterrent sentences are necessary, since absent the involvement of couriers, warehousemen and so on, these networks, whether established for the purposes of importation or subsequent distribution, would simply collapse: R v Le Cerf (1975) 13 SASR 237 and R v Laurentiu and Becheru (1962) 63 A Crim R 402”.


	
	As the result of the 15% discount which Chun Kit Lam received for his plea and the finding in relation to special circumstances, which also permitted an adjustment downwards of the non-parole period in his case, he must serve a minimum term of only 3 years imprisonment, before he becomes eligible for release on parole for this serious offence. The total term which he must serve, if not then released, is 5 years.
	
	
	Had Chun Kit Lam entered his plea at the earliest opportunity, as Bing-Jie Wang did, he would have received the same 25% discount Bing-Jie Wang received. He would then have been eligible to be released on parole after 2 years and 8 months, with a total term of 4 years and 5 months.  That comparison further demonstrates that, in reality, the sentence imposed on Chun Kit Lam did not result in a marked disparity to that imposed on Bing-Jie Wang for his offence, which can have left him with a justifiable sense of grievance, because justice has not been done in his case.
	
	
	The sentence imposed on Chun Kit Lam was not a heavy one. Where a parity appeal depends on a sentence imposed on a co-offender, which is submitted to be inadequate, a claimed sense of grievance may not be regarded as being legitimate (see Green at [106]). In such a case this Court is not bound to intervene, if the result would be to produce a sentence disproportionate to the objective and subjective criminality involved in the appellant’s offence (see Youkhana v R [2011] NSWCCA 37 at [49]).
	
	
	In my view, in this case, even if error had been established, further reducing Chun Kit Lam’s sentence would result in an entirely inadequate sentence, disproportionate to the objective and subjective criminality involved.
	
	
	In the result I consider that leave to appeal should be granted, but this appeal should be dismissed.
	


Chun Lok Lam - no disparity


	
	The same conclusion must follow in relation to Chun Lok Lam’s application for leave to appeal.
	
	
	His case was also that the sentence imposed upon him was so severe, when compared to that imposed on Bing-Jie Wang, that he had been left with a justifiable sense of grievance. The disparity in the two sentences was also argued not to have been justified by differences in their age, background, criminal history, general character, or the part which he played in this criminal enterprise or his criminal conduct.
	
	
	It was also submitted to be relevant that there were no Form 1 offences taken into account in Chun Lok Lam’s case. It was, however, accepted that his offence was more serious than that committed by his brother or Bing-Jie Wang, given his more senior role in this drug supply operation. Still, it was argued, the sentence imposed upon him was too high, with the result that it appeared that justice had not been done in his case.
	
	
	The justifiable sense of grievance on which Chun Lok Lam’s case depended was explained by reference to the statement of facts tendered at his hearing, which recorded the prosecution’s view that he was in a position above his brother and Bing Jie Wang. On appeal, it was submitted that the prosecution had not established an evidentiary basis for that view.
	
	
	These submissions should also not be accepted.
	
	
	It is well settled that an offender’s role and the level of criminality involved in a particular drug offence is more important in determining a sentence, than the quantity of drugs involved, which is not the sole or even principal determinant of a sentence, but an important one (see Melikian v R [2008] NSWCCA 156 at [42] and R v MacDonnell [2002] NSWCCA 34; (2002) 128 A Crim R 44 at [33]). The sentence imposed on an offender must reflect what he did. Where an offender’s role is not entirely known, however, the Court is not obliged to find facts favourable to the offender, or to accept his or her version of events (see Olbrich at [27] - [28]).
	
	
	Here McClintock DCJ was certainly entitled to proceed on the basis of what was in the agreed facts, as well as the answer to the question he asked, as to Chun Lock Lam’s role. When asked what Chun Lock Lam submitted as to his role, the answer was that he was “somewhere above Wang and Kit, how far above well, there’s just no evidence as to that”.
	
	
	It was also argued that Paxton v R [2011] NSWCCA 242; (2011) 219 A Crim R 104 obliged McClintock DCJ to assess the criminality of Chun Lok Lam by reference to his involvement in the steps taken to effect the drug supply, not by labels attached to him. Contrary to this approach, in submissions, McClintock DCJ put to the Crown:
	


“CORR: There’s certainly the degree of exploitation and they’re not - as I said they are not the generals or the colonels or whatever, but they’re--

HIS HONOUR: No. No, you’ve got a minder, a gofer and an NCO.

CORR: Yes but without those people it all falls down, your Honour.”


	
	This was submitted to be inconsistent with what his Honour had earlier observed in his sentencing remarks in Bing-Jie Wang’s case:
	


“Having said that, as I say, the state of the law does not require me to make a definitive determination. His role was significant and his role was clearly pivotal in the potential distribution of large amounts of illegal substances. I do not accept that he was a mere minder which was the submission faintly advanced during the sentence hearing.”


	
	In Chun Lok Lam’s case the agreed facts included that he was not residing at the Wolli Creek premises, but that he was a regular visitor there. He was observed carrying bags out of the premises on some occasions and fingerprints were found on a bag of drugs and other items associated with drug supply found in the premises. It was also agreed that:
	


“14.   The extent of Lok’s knowledge of the quantity of the drugs involved is unclear although, by his plea of guilty, there is an admission that he knew the amount involved was substantial.

15.   In terms of hierarchy, it is the prosecution’s position that Lok’s role was not that of the principal. It is the prosecution’s view that Lok was in a position above Kit and Wang. Lok’s role was as an intermediary included passing on messages from others in the group, and directing Kit and Wang.”


	
	It was also conceded for Chun Lok Lam on sentencing that his role was somewhat above that of his brother and Bing-Jie Wang, but that there was no evidence as to how far above them he was. The Crown accepted this, submitting that Chun Lok Lam was not “Big”, nor was he at the lowest level of this hierarchy.
	
	
	His Honour referred to these matters and observed that:
	


“The general principles in respect of sentencing for offences such as these are well known. I note the general purposes of punishment. There’s a very significant need for general deterrence in the usual case. The distribution of drugs such a(sic) methamphetamine reeks an untold(sic) damage on the hapless users of the substance. The very fact of the effect on the offender amply demonstrates its corrosive dangerousness.

The principle is that an offender is to be sentenced on the material available (see Olbrich v the Queen [1999] HCA 54, 199 CLR 270). There is little detail as to the precise role of the offender and even less regarding his actual state of knowledge. However it is clear that he played an active and continuous role in the operation to supply, albeit that it was of less significance than the principals.”


	
	There were no errors in his Honour’s conclusions as to these matters, notwithstanding the exchanges he earlier had with counsel during submissions about Bing-Jie Wang and his role.
	
	
	His Honour accepted that in terms of parity, Chun Lok Lam should have been dealt with more leniently than Bing-Jie Wang, given the single offence which he faced. However, his Honour considered that this was counterbalanced by Chun Lok Lam’s role, which required that he should be dealt with more severely.
	
	
	In all of the circumstances, there was no error in these conclusions. Chun Lok Lam’s offence was objectively a very serious drug offence, involving as it did, the supply of over 2.2 kilos of methylamphetamine, by a drug syndicate in which he was admittedly involved at a more senior level than either his brother or Bing-Jie Wang, as was agreed in the tendered facts and conceded in submissions.
	
	
	Those conclusions were reflected in the starting points for the two sentencing exercises: 7 years and 11 months in Chun Lok Lam’s case (not 7 years and 6 months which the Crown wrongly calculated by reference to a 10% discount) and 6 years and 8 months in Bing-Jie Wang’s case.
	
	
	Those starting points reflected the differences in the nature and seriousness of the respective offences; the offenders’ respective moral culpability for their offending; and their different subjective circumstances. They also reflected the application of the totality principle in Bing-Jie Wang’s case and the parity principle in Chun Lok Lam’s case. The results reflected the different discounts for the pleas entered, as well as his Honour’s different findings as special circumstances.
	
	
	As I have discussed in relation to Chun Kit Lam, the conclusions which his Honour reached as to the concurrent sentences imposed on Bing-Jie Wang, as the result of the application of the totality principle, have not been shown to have involved error and are, of themselves, not a proper basis on which a justifiable sense of grievance can rest, in Chun Lok Lam’s case.
	
	
	After a 15% discount, Chun Lok Lam’s sentence was reduced to 6 years and 9 months, with a non-parole period of 4 years and 6 months. Had he received a 25% discount, if his plea had been entered earlier, as Bing-Jie Wang’s was, his sentence would, however, have been 5 years and 11 months with a non-parole period of only 4 years.
	
	
	By comparison, Bing-Jie Wang’s sentence after a 25% discount, was a total term of 5 years, with a non-parole period of 2 years and 6 months.
	
	
	In Chun Lok Lam’s case, the sentence imposed also reflected a finding of special circumstances which resulted in a non-parole period which represented 67% of the total sentence. In Bing-Jie Wang’s case the ratio was 50%. It was not suggested that these conclusions involved error, or as to the ultimate outcome, a sentence which was argued to be too high in Chun Lok Lam’s case.
	
	
	McClintock DCJ did not find Chun Lok Lam’s subjective circumstances to be as compelling as those of either his brother, or those of Bing-Jie Wang, given that he was older than they and more mature. He also had not suffered the deprivations which Bing-Jie Wang had.
	
	
	Chun Lok Lam was considerably older than his two co-offenders. His Honour found that he had excelled at school and came to Australia, where he pursued business studies for 3 years. He came from a stable background, had been close to his grandparents and significantly affected by the death of one of them. Like his brother, he did not have a scaffolding of support here and gradually lost contact with his family, apart from his brother.
	
	
	A psychologist’s report was also tendered in his case. It outlined how he had come to use ice, when aged 20, becoming addicted to the point where his judgment had been affected. He claimed that he had accrued a substantial debt as a result, was subjected to threats and developed anxiety and depression. The report noted that he had a stronger command of English than his brother and that he had ceased drug abuse while in custody. He had also been diagnosed with a major depressive illness, which was at least partly reactive to his circumstances in Australia, the death of his grandparent and his involvement with and addiction to drugs.
	
	
	None of this evidence revealed any error in his Honour’s conclusions as to the nature and seriousness of Chun Lok Lam’s offending, his moral culpability for his offence, or the impact of his subjective circumstances. The higher sentence imposed upon him, than that imposed on the other two offenders, reflected the relevant differences between them and their offending, the conclusions which his Honour reached in relation to parity, discount and the finding of special circumstances in Bing-Jie Wang’s case. It was plainly open to his Honour to conclude that a higher sentence had to be imposed on Chun Lok Lam, than his two co-offenders, having regard to all of those matters.
	
	
	There were no errors shown in any of his Honour’s conclusions as to these matters. In the result, it must be concluded that no basis has been established for the justifiable sense of grievance on which this appeal depended.
	
	
	Further, like in his brother’s case, even if it was concluded that the sentence imposed on Bing-Jie Wang were inadequate, it could not be concluded that Chun Lok Lam had a legitimate sense of grievance.
	
	
	For his very serious offending, the sentence imposed upon Chun Kit Lam, requires him to serve a non-parole period of 4 years and 6 months, before he becomes eligible for release on parole. Given all the elements of punishment earlier discussed, the objective seriousness of his offence and his moral culpability, the sentence imposed for that offending could not be further reduced, without producing a sentence disproportionate to the objective and subjective criminality involved in his offence.
	
	
	In the result, while to leave to appeal should also be allowed in this case, I consider that the appeal must be dismissed.
	


Orders


	
	For these reasons, I would order in each case that leave to appeal be granted, but the appeal be dismissed.
	
	
	BELLEW J: I agree with Schmidt J.

		06 May 2015",2015-05-05 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2703497,R v Karnib [2015] NSWDC 84,"Judgment


	
	The offender, Ahmed Karnib, was arrested on 13 March 2012 and subsequently charged with the following two offences, to which he entered pleas of guilty in the Local Court on 28 February 2014, and for which he was on that date committed for sentence to this Court:
	
	
	The first is a Federal offence that he conspired with others, without requisite permission, to import prohibited tier 2 goods, namely, firearm parts and firearm magazines.
	
	
	The other is a State offence alleging that between about 10 November 2011 and about 9 November 2012, at Sydney, he knowingly took part in the sale of a firearm part on three or more separate occasions.
	
	
	The offender appears today for sentence, the matter having been stood over following a sentence hearing on 26 February this year.
	
	
	The facts out of which these charges arise are set out in a Statement of Facts which exceeds 50 pages. It is supplemented by schedules relating to the various imports the subject of the charges and some written submissions on sentence from the Crown, which comprise some 42 additional pages of material. Needless to say, the detail encompassed by those documents cannot sensibly be reproduced in these remarks. I have taken all that material into account and have endeavoured to fairly summarise it in the remarks that follow.
	
	
	In brief, the Statement of Facts describes the activities of a criminal enterprise operating in greater Sydney, New South Wales, which involved at least three known persons, the offender, a co-offender named Andrew Botros, who also appears for sentence today, and a co-accused Khoder El Ali.
	
	
	The offender was employed by Transitainer New South Wales Pty Limited, the local arm of a multinational freight forwarding business which was located on the upper floor at unit 5, 12 to 14 Murrumbidgee Avenue, Sylvania Waters.
	
	
	The co-offender was the licensee and operator of an Australia Post business located on the ground floor of 12 to 14 Murrumbidgee Avenue, downstairs from the office where the offender worked.
	
	
	El Ali was employed as a network technician at SingTel Optus in Macquarie Park, New South Wales.
	
	
	The criminal enterprise was collectively responsible for the progressive importation, between October 2011 and February 2012, of 20 packages, 18 from Germany and two from the USA, which in combination contained 496 prescribed constituent parts for at least 118 complete Glock semiautomatic pistols, 12 partial Glock semiautomatic pistols and also 220 magazines for use with Glock semiautomatic pistols. All of those parts and magazines, but for 140 magazines, successfully evaded detection by Australian authorities upon arrival and made their way into the community. The imported firearm parts were capable of being (and some in fact were) assembled by El Ali into complete firearms. Some of those firearms were unlawfully sold in either assembled or disassembled states. Police have recovered 14 Glock pistols, assembled, at least in part, from the Glock pistol parts imported as a result of this enterprise. At least 106 complete Glocks and 10 partial Glocks are believed to remain somewhere in the Australian community.
	
	
	Additionally, 80 parts for a further 20 Glock complete semiautomatic pistols were seized by police in Germany and an additional 100 Glock semiautomatic pistols and 250 large capacity magazines for use with Glock semiautomatic pistols had been ordered and part paid for prior to the arrest of the offender, Botros and El Ali. Further, prior to their arrest, El Ali and the offender had been discussing further importations and were considering alternative international sources of firearm parts and magazines and different methods by which they might be smuggled into Australia.
	
	
	Both offences are plainly very serious offences, as indicated by the maximum penalty which the respective Parliaments have prescribed for them. The Federal offence carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 10 years and/or a fine of $275,000. The State offence carries a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment.
	
	
	In relation to the conspiracy count, the Crown submitted that the criminal enterprise involved offending within the worst category of conduct caught by this offence. The reasons advanced for that submission included the following:
	
	
	First, that the object of the ongoing conspiracy was to smuggle into Australia firearm parts and magazines on a commercial scale.
	
	
	Secondly, that the firearm parts imported were capable of constructing complete firearms, capable of use with the magazines.
	
	
	Thirdly, the type of firearms involved were all high powered and readily concealable semiautomatic pistols, the availability of which to members of the public was tightly restricted under Australian law, because they pose a serious danger to public safety and law and order.
	
	
	Fourthly, that 496 prescribed constituent parts for not less than 118 complete and 12 partial such pistols and 80 magazines for use with such pistols were successfully smuggled into Australia in 20 separate packages and consequently were introduced into unregulated circulation in the community.
	
	
	Fifthly, a further 140 magazines for use with such pistols were also imported in a further package, however that package was intercepted, and its contents seized, by the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service upon arrival in Australia.
	
	
	Sixthly, 80 prescribed constituent parts for 20 additional pistols, which had been packaged for intended shipment to Australia were seized by law enforcement authorities in Germany.
	
	
	Seventh, orders had also been placed for an additional 100 such pistols and also for 250 large capacity magazines that were also intended to be smuggled into Australia, and those had been partly paid for.
	
	
	Eighth, after the importation of firearm parts was frustrated by the investigations of Australian and German law enforcement authorities, El Ali and the offender continued to conspire to source firearm parts from other sources and to smuggle them into Australia by other means.
	
	
	Ninth, the conspiracy was a sophisticated one and involved significant dishonest conduct, principally by El Ali, but also by the offender.
	
	
	Finally, in this connection, it was submitted that it is appropriate to have regard to the actual and potential consequences that may reasonably foreseeably result from the uncontrolled introduction into the community of the type and quantity of these prohibited goods, which the offenders voluntarily participated in smuggling into Australia.
	
	
	Each of those matters provides a reasonable foundation for informing an assessment of the objective gravity of the offending, however that assessment cannot be divorced from consideration of the particular conduct of the offender and his role in the criminal enterprise.
	
	
	In addition to supporting the general propositions just outlined concerning the nature and scope generally of the ongoing criminal enterprise, the Statement of Facts also conveys information concerning when each participant became involved in the criminal enterprise, the nature and extent of their respective roles, the extent of their knowledge of the full nature and scope of the criminal enterprise and their motivations for offending.
	
	
	In terms of the offender's conduct, I will consider first his involvement in the Federal offence and then his involvement in the State offence.
	
	
	A rational assessment of the offender's role and participation requires that some consideration also be given to assessing the role, knowledge, and motivation of El Ali, so far as it is revealed on the material before me.
	
	
	On the evidence before me, it is plain that El Ali was the principal controlling mind of the conspiracy, with complete knowledge of its extent and nature. The Statement of Facts describes the following activities undertaken by him in furtherance of the criminal enterprise:
	
	
	El Ali placed each of the orders for Glock pistols, parts and magazines using false identities and he selected what goods were ordered.
	
	
	He engaged in voluminous email correspondence with the German supplier of the vast majority of the firearms, misrepresenting that he was corresponding as or on behalf of various false personal and corporate identities, including ""Tony Ibbotson"" and ""Greg Richardson"" of ""Secure Training Pty Limited"", ""George Koulakiti"" of ""Safari Arms Australia Pty Limited"", inducing the German supplier to wrongly believe those fictional identities were involved in legitimate business activities with full knowledge of Australian law enforcement authorities. El Ali groomed the German supplier with promises of a lucrative ongoing business relationship.
	
	
	El Ali created and provided the German supplier with 11 counterfeit official Australian import permits, purportedly issued by an Australian Department of Defence official, for provision to German authorities, in order to induce legitimate export permits to be issued.
	
	
	El Ali directed the German supplier concerning the packaging of the orders of complete pistols, disassembled in separate parts, and provided alternative paperwork and packaging labels, with assistance from the offender, to accompany the packages to evade detection of their true contents when passing through foreign and Australian border controls.
	
	
	El Ali created a false email, supplied to the German supplier, impersonating an Australian Customs Officer as the email's purported author, misrepresenting that Australian law enforcement authorities had knowledge of and approved of the importation of the firearm parts and the method by which they were imported.
	
	
	El Ali also used a false identity, ""Simon Saltan"", when ordering Glock pistol parts in the USA, arranging on two occasions for them to be shipped to the address of a mail forwarding service for subsequent onward shipping to Australia.
	
	
	In 12 separate transactions, El Ali transferred or otherwise paid the German and US suppliers a total of approximately $A120,000 as payment for the goods and associated services supplied by the German and US suppliers. On five occasions El Ali did so using false identities, ""Tim Gordon"" or ""Simon Saltan"". On the final occasion payment was made, El Ali instead arranged for a third party, in return for promised payment, to transfer money, supplied by El Ali, on his behalf.
	
	
	Upon the arrival of the packages in Australia, El Ali was involved in assembling all or some of the parts into complete pistols.
	
	
	In addition to the 20 packages successfully imported into Australia which contained pistol parts or magazines, El Ali also ordered and part paid for further orders of pistols and 250 large capacity magazines which he intended be exported from Germany to Australia for sale here.
	
	
	Further, El Ali discussed with the offender possible future activities of the ongoing enterprise, discussing potential alternative avenues by which future quantities of firearm parts could be sourced from suppliers in Europe, the Middle East, North America or Asia and methods by which Australia's Customs controls could be evaded, such as concealment of firearm parts in imported shipping containers or importation via boat.
	
	
	The evidence points to El Ali's principal motivation likely being to derive personal profit from the unlawful sale of complete firearms constructed from the imported firearm parts and magazines.
	
	
	The offender's role in the enterprise, at least so far as it is revealed on the material before me, was far less extensive than El Ali's. That role was not insignificant by any means, and he was obviously trusted by El Ali, and an important adjunct to El Ali's activities, however, as the following outline of his involvement reveals, he plainly occupied a subordinate role to that of El Ali.
	
	
	The offender used the knowledge and experience he obtained with respect to international shipping through his employment at Transitainer NSW Pty Limited to engage in conduct which furthered the object of the smuggling enterprise. He also used that employment as a ""cover"" to minimise detection both of the enterprise generally and also his own and El Ali's unlawful involvement in the enterprise.
	
	
	The evidence establishes that the offender was involved in arranging the shipment to Australia of each of the packages shipped from Germany and also the USA. Including by communicating with various international freight companies, he facilitated each package being successfully smuggled into Australia, making arrangements for and monitoring the progress of shipments and undertaking activities to evade detection of the criminal enterprise by both foreign and Australian authorities.
	
	
	From an early stage, prior to any packages being successfully exported from Germany, the offender undertook overt activities in furtherance of the criminal enterprise, utilising skills and experience gained through his employment, to facilitate the importation of packages of firearm parts in a manner that evaded detection of their true contents, demonstrating his willingness or agreement to be involved with El Ali in the enterprise.
	
	
	Further, the offender, directly or indirectly, received each successfully imported package upon its arrival in Australia and distributed or caused them to be distributed to El Ali:
	
	
	Within one hour of the package designated G1 being received by the offender at his workplace from a FedEx courier on 11 November 2011, El Ali corresponded by email with the supplier, querying the whereabouts of the ""locking blocks"" that were to be included in that package, demonstrating the speed with which the offender distributed that package to El Ali.
	
	
	On 16 November and 13 December 2011, the offender arranged for a courier to collect the packages designated G2 and G6 from GFI Airlift and DHL's depots respectively and for their delivery to his workplace. Two days after the offender arranged for the collection of the package designated G2, El Ali corresponded with the supplier, acknowledging he had come into possession of that package by indicating he was returning the trigger locks that had been affixed to the receivers in that package for use in connection with El Ali's next order.
	
	
	The packages respectively designated G3, G4, G7 and G8 were received by the offender at his workplace from a FedEx courier.
	
	
	The offender arranged for a fellow employee of Transitainer to collect the package G5 from DHL's depots and deliver it to him. Package G12 was collected from DHL's depot either directly by the offender or by a colleague on his behalf.
	
	
	The packages designated G11, G13, G14 and G15 were delivered to Botros at his workplace. Whether the offender or Botros directly received packages G9, G10, G16, G17 and G18 from the delivering FedEx courier is more ambiguous, as records indicate that they were received by ""Ahmad"" at Botros' workplace.
	
	
	However, regardless of which packages Botros received directly, it is clear that Botros provided each package he received to the offender, or to an unknown person at the direction either of the offender or El Ali, more likely the former, for ultimate provision to El Ali. Evidence inferentially establishing that such coordinated activity occurred includes evidence of multiple unintercepted telecommunications between the offender and Botros on 20 and 23 January and 9 February 2012 proximate to the delivery of packages G13, G14, G15 and G18. Further, evidence derived from intercepted telecommunications and listening device recordings on 11, 17 and 25 February 2012 and 1, 5, 8, 9 and 13 March 2012 contribute to proof of the close association between the offender and Botros and support the inference that the offender coordinated the involvement of Botros' unlawful activity for promised remuneration to Botros.
	
	
	Additionally, to facilitate the continuation of the smuggling enterprise, the offender sought the return to the consignor of four packages sent to Australia, the true contents of which had been or were suspected of having been detected.
	
	
	The evidence, in particular intercepted telecommunications, discloses that the offender participated with El Ali in discussions concerning the future activities of the ongoing enterprise. From 17 February 2012, police lawfully intercepted the offender's telephones. A number of intercepted communications between the offender and El Ali, together with a conversation between the offender and El Ali on 1 March 2012, that was overheard in part by an undercover surveillance officer, disclose the offender's involvement in discussions concerning plans for the ongoing smuggling enterprise; discussing alternative avenues by which future quantities of firearm parts could be sourced from suppliers in Europe, the Middle East, North America or Asia and methods by which Australia's Customs controls could be evaded, such as concealment of firearm parts in shipping containers or importation via boat.
	
	
	It was submitted that the offender's role also extended to agreeing to participate in financing the ongoing criminal enterprise by agreeing to an unspecified portion of his share of an anticipated return from the enterprise being used to fund ongoing smuggling activities. This inference is said to arise in particular from intercepted telecommunications between the offender and El Ali on 17 and 25 February and 7 and 12 March 2012. The effect of those conversations seems to me to suggest that the offender is prepared to forego some of his anticipated financial reward so that some other unidentified participant might also be paid. I consider it is overstating the situation to say this represents some contribution to financing the operation. I am satisfied that the primary, if not sole, source of funding for the enterprise was El Ali, not the offender.
	
	
	I am satisfied that the offender knew that the criminal enterprise in which he was participating was specifically concerned with importing firearm parts and magazines into Australia, for use in construction of complete firearms, on a commercial scale. Evidence supporting that inference includes the following:
	
	
	First, evidence of the offender's involvement in making arrangements for the packages to be shipped to Australia from Germany and the USA, which I have already referred to.
	
	
	Second, evidence of the offender's involvement in receiving the imported packages.
	
	
	Third, evidence of the offender's involvement in monitoring packages and arranging or attempting to arrange the return of four packages sent to Australia, the true contents of which had been or were suspected of having been detected.
	
	
	Fourthly, evidence of lawfully intercepted telecommunications of conversations between the offender and El Ali covertly discussing difficulties El Ali was experiencing with respect to sales of firearm or firearm parts due to some ordered parts and, in particular, magazines not being available for supply to purchasers.
	
	
	Fifthly, evidence of lawfully intercepted telecommunications of conversations between the offender and El Ali indicating the offender's awareness of the substantial sum of money expended by El Ali in connection with the enterprise.
	
	
	Finally, the listening device recording on 13 March 2012 in which the offender affirms in response to Botros' inquiry, ""Is it only mags in it?"" ""Yeah, I don't know what size. It's for the Glocks.""
	
	
	The offender was aware that the activities being undertaken by the enterprise in which he was participating were unlawful. Evidence supporting that inference includes:
	
	
	First, the experience and knowledge the offender derived from his employment in connection with the importation of goods into Australia.
	
	
	Second, his participation in covert email communication with what he knew to be El Ali's false identities which concealed the true nature of the activities in which they were involved and which sought to portray the offender's involvement as genuine business activities, undertaken as part of his employment, when in fact the activities were undertaken independently of his employment.
	
	
	Third, evidence of the offender's efforts to conceal detection of the true contents of packages from foreign and Australian Customs officials, which I have already referred to.
	
	
	Fourth, lawfully intercepted telecommunications and listening device recordings of the offender's discussions with El Ali regarding possible or probable covert Australian Customs or police investigation, including discussion referring to El Ali's use of falsely subscribed telephone services and the need for the offender to exercise caution when discussing the enterprise with El Ali in telephone conversations due to the possibility of telecommunications interception by police.
	
	
	Fifth, lawfully intercepted telecommunications and listening device recordings of the offender and El Ali's discussions concerning Australian Customs border detection methodologies and their perception of the porousness of Australia's borders due to corruption within Australian Customs.
	
	
	Sixth, lawfully intercepted telecommunication recordings of conversation between the offender and El Ali concerning the purchasers of imported firearms and firearm parts, including a reference to a member of an outlaw motorcycle group, the Rebels.
	
	
	Finally, lawfully covertly recorded statements made by the offender to Botros whilst in police custody.
	
	
	I am satisfied that the offender's principal motivation was to derive some financial gain by way of payment to him of an unspecified sum. Intercepted conversations between the offender and El Ali support this inference, though no precise figure concerning actual or anticipated financial benefit can be quantified. I do not think there is a sufficient evidentiary foundation for the proposition that it was intended that he acquire a substantial share of the profits of the unlawful sale of the imported firearm parts and magazines. To characterise his expectation of financial gain as being a share of the profits is to attribute to him a more significant role than I am satisfied the evidence will bear.
	
	
	On the basis of the material I have outlined, the Crown submitted that the offender's objective criminality in respect of the Federal offence, whilst less than that of El Ali, ought properly be regarded as falling within the worst category of case. I do not accept that submission. Whilst his conduct is serious indeed, it seems to me one simply has to contrast the nature and extent of his involvement with that of El Ali to demonstrate the lack of a reasonable objective foundation for that conclusion.
	
	
	I turn now to consider the State offence.
	
	
	The offender is to be sentenced with respect to one State offence alleging that on three or more occasions between about 10 November 2011 and about 9 November 2012 he knowingly took part in the sale of a firearm part.
	
	
	The relevant Act, the Firearms Act, defined ""firearm part"" to include parts such as the slide, barrel, trigger mechanism, receiver and magazine of a firearm. That Act also contained a broad and non-exhaustive definition of ""sell"" which included ""... have in possession for sale or...consign or deliver for sale..."". The Act further extended the meaning of sale by defining taking part in sale to include conduct whereby a person ""takes, or participates in, any step, or causes any step to be taken, in the process of that sale..."".
	
	
	There is no evidence that the offender personally sold any firearm parts to any particular person. There is, however, evidence strongly supporting the inference that the large quantities of firearm parts were intended for sale and that some, if not all, were sold.
	
	
	The offender's guilty plea constitutes at its lowest an acceptance that in the relevant period he intentionally came into possession of the contents of three or more packages containing firearm parts and caused the contents of those packages to be delivered to El Ali, knowing that each package contained parts intended for sale for profit or to be offered for sale by El Ali.
	
	
	The Crown submitted, and I agree, that the objective seriousness of the offending was greater than the minimum established by the plea. However, I do not accept the Crown's submission that the offender's conduct should be assessed as objectively falling within the worst category of offending. As with the Federal offence, the conduct is serious but far from being rationally assessed as in the worst category in my assessment. The following matters inform the objective gravity of the offending.
	
	
	The evidence reveals that, directly or indirectly, the offender came into possession of and delivered to El Ali each of the packages successfully imported from Germany and the USA containing firearm parts, being 18 packages from Germany and two from the USA.
	
	
	On that basis, in circumstances where several packages were received on the same date, I am satisfied that in the period between 10 November 2011 (the date upon which the first imported package was received by the offender) and the date of his arrest on 13 March 2012, the offender knowingly participated in the sale of a firearm part on multiple occasions, that is approximately seventeen times.
	
	
	Additionally, on each occasion he knowingly participated with respect to multiple firearm parts; between 4 and 80 parts on each occasion. The number, type and quality of the parts to be sold is also a relevant consideration in assessing the seriousness of the offending.
	
	
	The type of firearm to which the firearm parts correspond is also a relevant consideration. Each of the firearm parts related to a firearm that constituted a prohibited pistol within the meaning of the Firearms Act, a more restricted class of firearm, and in relation to which aggravated penalties for unlawful possession apply. Each type of firearm was so characterised due to its short barrel length, which made it more readily concealable, consistent with unlawful possession and use for criminal purposes, and hence a greater risk to public safety.
	
	
	As at February 2015, 14 firearms known to have been constructed from not less than 38 parts successfully imported into Australia by the criminal enterprise have been recovered by police. It might reasonably be inferred that each of those firearms part were sold by El Ali prior to the arrests of El Ali and the offender on 13 March 2012. Of those 14 firearms, five firearms, constructed from parts contained in seven of the successfully imported packages were recovered in the 12 month period commencing from the arrival of the first successfully imported package on 10 November 2011.
	
	
	Further, although the whereabouts of most of the imported firearm parts has not yet been ascertained, I am satisfied that the evidence supports an inference that they or a large proportion of them were sold by El Ali prior to his arrest.
	
	
	There is evidence that the offender knew or at least eventually became aware of the reasonably foreseeable probability that the firearm parts were to be sold to members of the criminal milieu, including those potentially connected with drug trafficking activities. Apart from the inference to be drawn from the commercial nature of the enterprise, the intercepted telephone conversation between the offender and El Ali on 17 February 2012 refers to El Ali informing the offender about problems that had arisen with respect to the sale of firearm parts to a member of The Rebels outlaw motorcycle club.
	
	
	In my assessment, the scale and extent of the criminal enterprise, the quantity and type of firearm parts concerned and the longevity of risk created by their sale gave rise to a risk to the public substantially exceeding the norm for the offence. The risk to public safety here is beyond the norm due to the reasonable expectation that the firearms are to be sold into a criminal milieu generally.
	
	
	In considering the potential risk it is relevant that of the 14 firearms recovered by police, three are alleged to have been unlawfully discharged in public places and one was recovered six days after the occupant of the property in which the firearm was located allegedly committed an armed robbery. The high public risk is manifest.
	
	
	The concerted nature of the activities of the offender in his dealings with El Ali also informs the seriousness of the offending. It is not an inherent feature of the offence that multiple persons will act in concert in bringing about the sale of the firearm parts. Whilst it might not constitute a marked difference, the fact that the offender was more in the nature of an intermediary in respect of this offending, and plainly below El Ali in the clear hierarchy of the enterprise, supports a finding of less culpability on the part of the offender.
	
	
	As with the Federal offence, the present offending was part of a planned criminal activity motivated by the prospect of monetary gain. In respect of both offences, it should be noted, however, that there is no evidence that the offender in fact benefitted substantially from his involvement. There is no apparent accumulation of wealth or substantial assets. All the offending was carried out whilst the offender was living at home with his parents and sharing a room with his teenage brother. There is also no evidence that the offender was a significant contributor with respect to the cost of any of the parts.
	
	
	The proper characterisation of his conduct is that he participated, directly or indirectly in the forwarding of packages to the intended vendor so that their contents could be sold. He was not the seller, nor could he rationally be equated with the seller in the scheme of the criminal enterprise. Accordingly, as I have indicated, whilst his involvement is serious it is far from being within the worst category of offending.
	
	
	The gravamen of the Federal offence relates to the offender's involvement over an extended period in an agreement to import into Australia substantial quantities of firearm parts, capable of assembly into complete firearms, and corresponding magazines. It encompasses offending of an incomplete or inchoate nature, relating to the contents of the packages seized in Germany and ongoing plans to continue to import firearm parts and magazines supplied by other sources and smuggled into Australia by alternative means. The gravamen of the State offence is that the offender came into possession of and directly or indirectly participated in the distribution to El Ali of firearm parts from the successfully imported packages, knowing that they were to be sold or offered for sale by El Ali. I am satisfied that the ultimate importer was El Ali and that until the parts were in his hands the importation was continuing.
	
	
	There is accordingly a substantial overlap between the Federal and State offending, such that it is appropriate there be limited accumulation between the sentence for each offence. Some modest accumulation to reflect the two crimes is appropriate and will be evident in the sentences I impose.
	
	
	The offender did not give evidence on sentence. What follows concerning his subjective circumstances is taken from the evidence tendered on his behalf, which comprised the evidence of his father, both oral and written, from his mother, his younger sister and brother, two character references, one of which contains an offer of future employment, and a report of a psychiatrist, Dr Olav Nielssen.
	
	
	The offender was born on 12 November 1990. He is now 24 years old. He was only 20 years of age when he commenced his involvement in this criminal enterprise. According to a history given to Dr Nielssen, the offender's participation was secured following an approach from some people who found out he worked in the shipping industry. Those people were apparently acquainted with people known to the offender. He told Dr Neilssen ""they asked me to do something...they told me we can use your name...it's clean...nothing will come back to you...they did promise me a little bit of money...me being stupid, I agreed"". Apparently he was repeatedly reassured that nothing would happen to him and he now accepts it was pretty stupid of him to have believed that. The evidence points to the likelihood of the offender having been introduced to El Ali through a maternal uncle, his mother's step-brother, a man named Jihad Taha.
	
	
	The offender has no prior criminal history and I am satisfied his participation, which was completely at odds with his history and upbringing, was a consequence of his immaturity. He was lured by the prospect of some financial gain, I suspect without any advertence to the significance or broader consequences for the community of the crimes in which he became involved.
	
	
	The offender appears to have had a relevantly unremarkable upbringing. He appears to have grown up within a stable and loving family, with whom he was still living at the time of his arrest. He is the eldest of three children. His sister, now aged 22, is studying to become a teacher and his younger brother is in year 12 at high school. His father is, and has for 25 years, been self-employed driving limousines. Both parents are of Shia Muslim background. His father, originally from a rural area in the south of Lebanon, moved to Australia when he was six and his mother, also of Lebanese background, was born in Australia. His parents have always tried to instil in their children the values of hard work and honesty and integrity.
	
	
	The offender attended an Islamic school near the family home in Greenacre. He was a keen sportsman, and played soccer, rugby league and cricket. He left school in year 9, to the immense surprise, apparently, both of his family and the school. It seems he was a bright, capable student, who had promising prospects and had displayed no conduct problems. He left school to take up a job at Transitainer, a business apparently owned by one of his father's clients. He remained in that job until the time of his arrest and by all accounts applied himself diligently and capably to the work and progressed within the firm, being promoted a number of times. At the time of his arrest he held the position of operations supervisor. He had completed a TAFE course in freight forwarding. Outside of work his hobbies include all forms of support and fishing and boating in the Sydney region.
	
	
	The offender has expressed to his family and to Dr Neilssen his considerable regret for his conduct. In prison he has been exposed to people who would use guns to harm others. This experience has brought him to comprehend the seriousness of his offending. He appreciates now that he has not only let himself and his family down, but also the entire community. He had never previously appreciated the effect and seriousness of having gun parts enter Australia destined for the black market. I accept that the offender's remorse is genuine and that he has now, but did not at the time, a genuine appreciation of the seriousness of his conduct and the appalling consequences to which it was giving rise.
	
	
	The offender's time in prison has been confronting and disturbing. He was by reason of his conduct taken from the warmth and security of his family home, the only home he had ever known, into the confronting reality of maximum security detention. That experience has had significant consequences for him. He has lost a considerable amount of weight, and hair, both he thinks on account of the stress he feels in his present situation and does not sleep well. He has developed a degree of anxiety, fearful for his own safety, particularly after having had to share cells at times with people withdrawing from the effects of the drug ice. He told Dr Nielssen that he has to watch his back and that it has been “pretty scary”.
	
	
	The offender has a deep and committed connection with his family. The support from them that he enjoys, notwithstanding his circumstances, is considerable. His mother, father, sister and brother have all regularly visited him in prison. He has also maintained telephone contact with individual family members between visits. His family have been deeply affected by the apparent physical and psychological decline of the offender as a result of his experience of incarceration.
	
	
	There are a number of factors which in my view support a conclusion that the offender has excellent prospects of rehabilitation once released. These are in addition to the insight into offending which he has gained during his time in custody, and the strong family support he enjoys, both of which I have already mentioned and which themselves provide an important foundation to his prospects.
	
	
	First, he has a commendable employment history since leaving school. Save for the period shortly before his arrest when he was drawn into this offending, he appears always to have applied himself diligently and energetically to his work and to have achieved appropriate recognition through promotion.
	
	
	Secondly, and related to that first consideration, the offender has work already lined up upon release from custody. He plans to return to work with a family friend, helping in the administrative side of that friend's plumbing business.
	
	
	Thirdly, the offender's prospects are enhanced in my view by the positive role-modelling provided by the example of his father who throughout the offender's life has had stable employment in the form of the long-term conduct of his own business, and who has always tried to instil in the offender the values of hard work and integrity.
	
	
	Fourthly, his risk of recidivism seems to be low. That risk is reduced by factors such as his stable mental health and his strong family support. As Dr Neilssen pointed out the two main predictors of recidivism, a history of anti-social conduct and the presence of any form of substance use disorder, do not feature in the offender's history.
	
	
	Finally, for present purposes, the offender's prior good character provides a sound basis for confidence for his future. That good character is manifest not merely in the absence of prior convictions but in the body of evidence that points to the offender having been, at least until drawn into the criminal enterprise that led to his arrest, a determined, hard-working and caring young man.
	
	
	In addition to the contribution it makes to my confidence in his prospects, the offender will be accorded the leniency that his prior good character fairly attracts, notwithstanding that he engaged in a course of conduct over a period of time and that his employment afforded him the opportunity more readily to commit the offences, in particular the Federal offence.
	
	
	He will also be extended leniency on account of his pleas. Notwithstanding what the Crown reasonably submits is a strong Crown case, in respect of each offence I will allow a discount of 25% for the plea, to recognise the facilitation of the course of justice in respect of the Federal offence and the utilitarian value of the plea to the State offence.
	
	
	The offender's remorse is profound in my assessment. It is not only reflected in the pleas of guilty. It is also reflected in the insight which he has plainly acquired as to the nature of his offending, and the profound repercussions for the community generally which flow from the introduction of illegal firearms onto a black market.
	
	
	I am satisfied that the offending represents the naive conduct of an immature young man who foolishly acceded to a request made of him, without any, or any significant, advertence to the true nature or the broader consequences of his conduct. He was seduced, apparently, by the prospect of some unquantified financial gain. That seduction, however, seems to have been profound, in that the level of his involvement plainly escalated over time, from an initial willingness to lend his name to the enterprise, in his capacity as a freight forwarder, to an eventual participation in discussions concerning future importations.
	
	
	As in any sentencing exercise, at least whilst it continues to have statutory recognition, appropriate account must be given to the object of general deterrence, along with the other, some countervailing, objects of sentencing.
	
	
	Without any apparent foundation in evidence, whether in the form of academic research or otherwise, in respect of offences of this character (and other offences which might involve a risk to public safety, or be considered abhorrent on some other ground) courts have sometimes said that general deterrence should be a predominant consideration. Frankly, absent an evidence base, it does not appear to me that there is a sufficient basis in principle or policy for the object at all, much less a basis to give that object any prominence in the synthesis over and above the other objects which are given statutory recognition in the sentencing exercise. Bald statements to the effect that it is a ""cogent fact that the fear of punishment does, and will, prevent the commission of any many [crimes] that would have been committed if it was thought that the offender could escape punishment"", or incur only a light punishment, (R v Rushby [1977] 1 NSWLR 594 at 598 per Street CJ, cited at para [64] of the Crown’s written submissions) cannot rationally be elevated to expressions of principle without some objective demonstration of the asserted cogent fact. If the notions of individualised justice, which substantially underpin the exercise of the sentencing discretion, are to be given any more than mere lip service, then the various objects of sentencing must be balanced according to the particular circumstances and features of individual cases.
	
	
	To dictate in advance that predominance be given to one object over another divorced from a consideration of the circumstances of any particular case, for example merely by reason of the character of the offence, is to fetter the discretion in a way that skews the balancing exercise which must necessarily be undertaken in each individual case. So to skew the exercise neither serves the interests of justice, so far as those interests are comprehended by serving the best interests of the community, nor serves the interests of justice so far as an individual offender is concerned. Indeed to give predominance to general deterrence, without any evidence base to support the proposition that there is any relevant deterrent effect achieved by sentences heavier than they might otherwise be, seems to me to run the significant risk of creating a positive injustice, particularly if other features of a case provide rational support for the proposition that the interests of justice and the community are better served by giving a preponderance of weight to other objects, such as an appropriate mix of rehabilitation and specific deterrence for example. It may be, in due course, there should be reconsideration of the statutory recognition of some of the presently recognised objects of sentencing, so as to reflect an appropriate evidence base.
	
	
	Whether it be by considerations of general deterrence, or by giving due weight to notions of punishment and denunciation, recognition must be given in this exercise to the reasonable community concern about firearms-related offending. Whatever might have been the motivation for the offending, and however little thought might have been brought to bear by the offender as to the broader consequences of the offending, one must acknowledge in this synthesis the fact that his conduct contributed to the introduction into the community of a substantial number of dangerous weapons, inevitably destined for illicit use of one kind or another, and most of which have not been recovered. The community is entitled to know that the Courts, through the sentences they impose, give appropriate recognition to the seriousness of these consequences.
	
	
	Those considerations must be taken into account in a way that reflects appropriate proportionality between the circumstances of the crime committed and the sentence imposed, taking appropriate account, of course, of the subjective circumstances so as to properly reflect that fundamental notion of individualised justice underpinning the exercise of the sentencing discretion.    
	
	
	Specific deterrence too, must not be left out of account, even accepting, as I do, that the case for the conclusion that the offender has excellent prospects for rehabilitation, and is at a very low risk of re-offending, is reasonably compelling. Even when the risk is low, there is a risk. It can be managed, and the present expressed intensions and desires of the offender for the future fortified, by structuring a sentence which takes account of a degree of specific deterrence.
	
	
	Above all, however, where one is sentencing someone as young as the offender, with the prior good character that he has demonstrated, and against the background of the strong case which has been presented for a finding of excellent prospects of rehabilitation, one must give particular account to that object in the synthesis alongside the other objects of sentencing which I have indicated must also feature in this sentencing exercise.
	
	
	The development to maturity is a process. It is trite to say that it does not occur overnight. This offending, which in my assessment was substantially founded in the cognitive, psychological and social immaturity of the offender, and a corresponding lack of capacity to appreciate the true nature, scope and consequences of what he was being asked to do, has had profound consequences for the offender and his family. For him, it has provided a cathartic opportunity to gain valuable insight into the consequences of offending generally, but of this type of offending in particular, both for the broader community and, more immediately, for his family. He has now had an opportunity in custody to reflect on the future and his capacity for choice in terms of finding the right path in life. For his family, the offending has produced a considerable dislocation and stress, I think particularly for his mother, but not only for her. This has not escaped the offender's attention and, in my assessment, his expressed desire to ensure that this never happens again, which I find to be both a considered and genuine expression, will be a powerful motivating factor going forward.
	
	
	My instinctive assessment is that this offender's history, his present attitude, the strength and depth of family and other support he has, including in terms of having a place to live and a job to return to upon his release, point to the likelihood of him making a law abiding return to being a productive and valuable member of his family and the community. Extending appropriate leniency at this stage, I believe, will positively encourage that process. It does not seem to me that the process, or the corresponding benefits to the community, will be served by requiring this young man to spend considerably more time in prison than the time he has already served. Indeed, to do so has greater potential for deleterious inhibition of the process in my view. Due recognition must be given to the capacity, which I am satisfied the offender has, to reform and mould his character so as to return to his former law abiding existence. The interests of the community in facilitating the process of rehabilitation is much better served in this case by a significant finding of special circumstances, which I make based upon the various matters I have outlined, and a substantial corresponding adjustment to the statutory ratio in respect of the State offence. In that way, a sentence can be structured which gives appropriate recognition to the various countervailing objects of the exercise and which provides the greatest potential for the community to benefit positively from the offender's ultimately renewed contribution to it. A head sentence for that offence can be fixed which appropriately reflects the objects of general deterrence, punishment and denunciation, and a period of supervision imposed which will allow for two significant things. Firstly, for the monitoring and support of the progress of the offender's return to a productive law-abiding life, including through any programs that might be deemed necessary in assisting that reintegration, including possibly some counselling, from which Dr Neilssen thought the offender would benefit. Secondly, in fortifying the offender's presently positive resolve, through the deterrent effect of knowing that if he re-offends he may have a substantial period of additional custody to serve if his parole is revoked. In the structure of an overall sentence, the sentence imposed in respect of the Federal offending can be accommodated around the sentence for the State offence, with some modest accumulation as I have already indicated.
	
	
	The offender has been in custody since his arrest on 13 March 2012, having at some point been refused bail by the Supreme Court. As at today, he has spent just short of three years and two months (1,150 days) in custody. I will, of course, taken that time into account when imposing sentence.
	
	
	I make the following orders.
	
	
	In respect of the offence of conspiracy to import prohibited goods the offender is convicted. The offender is sentenced to a term imprisonment of six years to date from 13 March 2012 and ending on 12 March 2018. I direct that he be released on 12 December 2015 upon entering into a recognizance self in the sum of $1,000 without surety to be of good behaviour for the balance of the term, that is the period of two years and three months from 12 December 2015 until 12 March 2018 and to appear to receive sentence if called upon to do so at any time in respect of any breach within that period.
	
	
	In respect of the offence of knowing participation in the sale of firearm parts the offender is convicted. He is sentenced to a term of imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of three years and six months commencing on 13 June 2012 and expiring on 12 December 2015, and a balance of term of four years and six months commencing on 13 December 2015 and expiring on 12 June 2020.
	
	
	The total effective sentence is eight years and three months, the total effective non-parole period is three years and nine months. The offender will be eligible for release to parole on 12 December 2015.

		03 June 2015",2015-05-06 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2703512,Nguyen v R [2015] NSWCCA 78,"HEADNOTE

[This headnote is not to be read as part of the judgment]

The appellant appeals against her conviction of one count of supplying not less than the commercial quantity of a prohibited drug (heroin) contrary to s 25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW) (the Act), for which she was tried with the co-accused Hung Vu (Vu) and found guilty by a jury. Vu was the appellant’s former de facto husband. The drugs were found in a chip bag found on the front passenger side floor of a vehicle being driven by Vu in which the appellant was a passenger. The appellant denied that she was knowingly involved in any drug transaction, and denied that she had any knowledge of the presence of the drug in the chip bag.

The Crown case was one of deemed supply pursuant to s 29 of the Act. The Crown alleged that the appellant was engaged with Vu in a joint criminal enterprise to supply the drug. Its case was based on evidence of intercepted phone calls between Vu and a third person, Tan Phong Le, who was the subject of an Australian Crime Commission investigation and physical surveillance evidence of meetings between Le, Vu and the appellant. Additionally, the appellant’s involvement in the illegal enterprise was alleged to be evidenced by her presence in the days preceding her arrest when she and Vu twice met with Le, and from lies and inconsistencies in statements she made to the police following her arrest.

The appellant raised two grounds of appeal: first, that the trial judge erred in failing to direct the jury that the Crown was required to prove that the appellant knew a commercial quantity of the drug was involved in the offence; and secondly, that the verdict was unreasonable or could not be supported having regard to the evidence.

The Court, allowing the appeal, held:   

(1)        Effect of failure to give proper directions

(a)       Knowledge that a commercial quantity of a particular drug is involved is an essential element of the offence under s 25(2) of the Act, and a failure to properly direct the jury as to an essential element of an offence is likely to amount to a miscarriage of justice, such that leave should be granted for the appellant to appeal on this point. [41]-[46].

R v Lau (1998) 105 A Crim R 167; R v Micalizzi [2004] NSWCCA 406; Ka Chung Fung v R [2007] NSWCCA 250; R v Moussa [2001] NSWCCA 427; 125 A Crim R 505; R v Gulliford [2004] NSWCCA 338; 148 A Crim R 558.

(b)       The evidence was not sufficient to establish that, had they been properly directed, the appellant would inevitably have been convicted of the offence under s 25(2), as there was no evidence that implicated the appellant with knowledge of the quantity of the drugs. It followed that the proviso to s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act ought not be applied. [47]-[48]

Baiada Poultry Pty Ltd v The Queen [2012] HCA 14; 246 CLR 92

(c)        For the Court to enter a substituted verdict, pursuant to s 7(2) of the Criminal Appeal Act, the jury’s satisfaction of the facts underlying the substituted verdict must be unaffected by the misdirection. However, it was not necessary to decide this question given the Court’s conclusion on the second ground of appeal. [51]-[52].

Mehajer v R [2014] NSWCCA 167

(2)        Whether the verdict was unreasonable or could not be supported having regard to the evidence

(a)       The evidence that the appellant was involved in any drug transaction was not sufficient for it to be open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the appellant’s guilt. It followed that the verdict was unreasonable or could not be supported having regard to the evidence. [53]-[71].

MFA v R [2002] HCA 53; 213 CLR 606; M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; 181 CLR 487; SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13.

(b)       To be probative of guilt, lies of the accused must be explicable only on the basis that the truth would be consistent only with commission of the offence charged. In this case, inconsistencies in the appellant’s evidence, were explicable on the basis of no more than that the appellant knew that Vu and Le were involved in an illegal drug transaction, and were therefore not probative of her own guilt. [69]-[70].

Edwards v R [1993] HCA 63; 178 CLR 193; Eade v The King (1924) 34 CLR 154; Zoneff v The Queen [2000] HCA 28; 200 CLR 234; Doggett v The Queen [2001] HCA 46; 208 CLR 343; R v Heyde (1990) 20 NSWLR 234.

Judgment


	
	THE COURT: The appellant appeals against her conviction of one count of supply of not less than the commercial quantity of a prohibited drug (heroin) contrary to s 25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW) (the Act). A commercial quantity of heroin, for the purposes of the Act, is 250 g: Sch 1. The appellant was tried with the co-accused Hung Vu (Vu).
	
	
	The Crown case at trial was that the appellant was engaged with Vu, her former de facto husband, in a joint criminal enterprise to supply the drug. The Crown case was one of deemed supply pursuant to s 29 of the Act whereby a person who has possession of not less than the trafficable quantity of a prohibited drug is deemed to have the drug for the purposes of supply, unless the person has the drug in possession otherwise than for supply: s 29(a). A trafficable quantity of heroin is 3 g: Sch 1 of the Act.
	
	
	The appellant and Vu were apprehended by police at 1:50 pm on 9 February 2012 when the vehicle in which they were travelling was stopped by police. Vu had been driving the vehicle, which was said to belong to his sister, with whom they were staying. The appellant was in the front passenger seat.
	
	
	The heroin in respect of which the appellant and Vu were charged was found on the floor of the front passenger’s side of the vehicle. The heroin had been packed in a plastic bag and placed inside a large heat sealed plastic bag before being placed in a bag commercially labelled “Mission Original Tortilla Strips White Corn” (the Mission Tortilla chip bag). The Mission Tortilla chip bag was folded over at the top but was not itself sealed. The arresting officer, Detective Campbell, in response to a question in cross-examination that the drugs could not be seen through the clear window of the Mission Tortilla chip bag said: “I think you probably could, yes.”
	
	
	The heroin found in the vehicle weighed 352.2 g and had a purity of 47 per cent. Detective Sergeant Jonathon Woods gave evidence that the usual way in which heroin is imported into Australia is in a 350 g (or greater) “block” and, at the time of importation, is generally of approximately 75 per cent purity. The heroin in this case had been diluted, but was saleable at 47 per cent purity.
	
	
	The principal issue at trial in the case against the appellant was whether the Crown could establish that she was knowingly involved in the drug transaction with Vu. There was no direct evidence of the state of the appellant’s knowledge and the Crown case relied upon the drawing of inferences both as to her knowledge that the Mission Tortilla chip bag contained heroin and as to the quantity of the drug involved.
	
	
	The appellant denied having any knowledge of the presence of the drug in the Mission Tortilla chip bag. She said that the first time she became aware of the bag was when she and Vu were driving from Newtown to Punchbowl and the bag was knocked against her leg. She said she saw chips through the clear window of the bag. Vu also denied any knowledge of drugs being in the Mission Tortilla chip bag and contended that the arrangements upon which the Crown relied to establish the charge of supplying a prohibited drug against him were in fact arrangements he had been making with the person Tan Phong Le (Le) for the supply of “girls” (young women).
	
	
	The appellant raised two grounds of appeal:
	



	
	The trial judge erred in failing to direct the jury that the Crown was required to prove that the appellant knew a commercial quantity of the drug was involved in the offence.
	
	
	The verdict was unreasonable or could not be supported having regard to the evidence.
	


Background facts


	
	Vu participated in a number of telephone calls between 4 and 9 February with Le, in which, on the Crown case, Vu arranged to obtain the drugs from Le. Le at that time was the subject of an Australian Crime Commission investigation, including by way of physical surveillance and telephone interception. Relevantly, the police intercepted telephone calls between Le and Vu on 4 February, 7 February, 8 February and 9 February 2012. The calls were made on a mobile phone with a sim card that Vu had obtained on 26 January 2012 in a different name. He claimed this was to ensure his family did not know he was arranging for girls. The telephone calls were conducted in the Vietnamese language. There was no express reference to drugs in the telephone conversations. However, Detective Sergeant Woods gave evidence that various code words were used such as “girls”, “photo” and “virgin”, which were words known in the drug trade as code for drugs.
	
	
	There was physical surveillance of Le on 7 and 9 February. On each occasion, Vu and the appellant were observed in Le’s company at The Star casino. On 9 February, Vu and the appellant were also observed at Le’s convenience store at Newtown. Police followed Vu and the appellant to Punchbowl, where they were arrested. The Crown alleged that the drugs were obtained from Le at the meeting at the convenience store.
	
	
	It is necessary to consider the events from 4 February 2012 to 9 February 2012 in closer detail.
	


4 February 2012


	
	The appellant and Vu had three children. The appellant lived in Canberra with their son. Vu lived in Melbourne with their two daughters. The appellant had another daughter who also lived in Melbourne. The appellant had gone to Melbourne to visit her daughters the weekend before her arrest. She stayed with her eldest daughter and with a boyfriend whom she occasionally dated.
	
	
	There were two telephone calls on 4 February between Vu and Le that were subject of interception. The conversations were conducted in Vietnamese, save for the occasional use of an English word. (English words used in the telephone calls were bolded in the official translation in evidence. That bolding is maintained below in the extracted portions.)
	
	
	In the first telephone call, made by Vu to Le shortly after 11:12 am, the following conversation occurred:
	


“[Le]:   Hello

[Vu]:   Hello is it you bro?

[Le]:   Yeah

[Vu]:   Well that issue how is it going bro?

…

[Le]:   Yeah um by midday er this afternoon then I er I my friend um will set to see me until later this afternoon so please be assured when er I will buzz you

…

[Vu]:   They urge me like hell you know?

[Le]:   Yeah yeah I know already I know already I understand I understand I understand yeah”.


	
	Detective Sergeant Woods said that the phrase “urge me like hell you know” was consistent with Vu indicating that he was experiencing pressure from buyers regarding his capacity to supply the drugs.
	
	
	The second phone call was made by Vu to Le shortly before 7:57 pm. The conversation was as follows:
	


“[Le]:   What’s up?

[Vu]:   The other brother has just phoned me

[Le]:   Yeah I know already I know already so now um now that that that chick of NGOC (F) she er she arrives at this time so please come over to do it er to try it come over to visit her

…

[Le]:   … so are you coming over?

[Vu]:   Um er would it not be er er would it be him who is going to take the chick’s photo down here to my friend bro?

[Le]:   Oh no er motherfucker that chick er she she she is still virgin you know?

…

[Le]:   … looking at her she looks quite good …

[Vu]:   Does she?

[Le]:   Yeah I know already there’s no problem at all

[Vu]:   If so there’s no need to bother

[Le]:   Yeah

[Vu]:   If so say so then I would trust you bro there’s nothing further to keep backing away

[Le]:   Yeah

[Vu]:   So just fucking send it down to me and that’s all bro!

…

[Le]:   So please let me do like this by tomorrow midday … I will … meet them er then I tell them … to go … down there by themselves … to see you alright?

[Vu]:   Yeah yeah

[Le]:   Yeah okay tomorrow”


	
	Detective Sergeant Woods gave evidence that the words “girl”, “photo” and “virgin” were code words relating to drugs and to heroin specifically. He said that the import of the conversation included that, when Le vouched for the purity of the drugs, Vu said he trusted Le.
	


6 February


	
	The appellant met Vu on 6 February 2012 at her eldest daughter’s home in Melbourne. They talked about their children. The appellant suggested to Vu that he visit their son in Canberra. The appellant also asked her boyfriend to come with her to Sydney and she, her boyfriend “Tim”, and Vu flew to Sydney and stayed at The Star casino on the night of 6 February. She said that she came to Sydney as it was Vietnamese New Year and she wanted to take her boyfriend to the Ballroom in the Cabra-Vale Club. She said she did not know “Tim’s” full name, although she had known him a long time. She also said she would not be able to find out his full name, as “he is a trusting person, he don’t take any advantage of me”.
	


7 February 2012


	
	In telephone calls on 7 February, Vu and Le arranged to meet at The Star casino. They met at 11:49 am. There was video and police surveillance of them during their meeting. Vu and Le went to the gaming room and sat in the designated smoking corner of the room. At 12:05 pm, Vu left Le for a short period and returned in the company of another man who sat with them. At 12:16 pm, Vu left Le and the other man and returned with the appellant, who had been playing a gaming machine.
	
	
	The appellant was in the company of Vu, Le and the other man for a total of seven minutes. At 12:19 pm, she was observed to remove a mobile phone from her handbag and hold it in her left hand. She was also seen with a mobile phone in her right hand. She was observed to look at that phone and then hand it to Le. While looking at the mobile phone in her right hand, she was observed to appear to start using the keypad of the phone in her left hand. There was no evidence relating to the second phone other than that she handed it to Le. For example, there was no evidence of who owned the phone, of whether it was later located by the police as part of the investigation or whether it had been the subject of any intercepts.
	
	
	The group left the gaming room at 12:22 pm. Le left the casino and Vu, the appellant and the third person went towards the food hall.
	
	
	The appellant’s version of this meeting was that she and her boyfriend were in the smoking area of The Star casino when Vu met a man she later learned was Le. She said, however, that she was not introduced to Le at the time and that Vu did not explain to her why Le was there. She said that she was not paying attention to any conversation between Vu and Le, as she was playing with her phone. She did not recall handing a phone to Le.
	
	
	The appellant’s boyfriend returned to Melbourne on 7 February. The appellant remained with Vu and travelled to his sister’s home in Punchbowl where they stayed that night. It should be noted that the identification of this person as Vu’s sister did not mean there was a filial relationship between Vu and her. The identification of “sister” appears to have been a colloquial form of expression.
	


8 February 2012


	
	Two telephone calls between Vu and Le were intercepted on 8 February. The first was at 3:15 pm, when Vu telephoned Le, as follows:
	


“[Vu]   … do we know what time it is for tomorrow yet?” (White 170; Resp subs (10)).

[Le]: … not yet I’ll ring you if anything … relax, don’t be too anxious … I’m seeing them now … I’ll ring you to let you know.”


	
	Sometime after that conversation, the appellant and Vu travelled to Canberra to see their son. They arrived at about 9 pm. At about 10:30 pm, Vu received a telephone call from Le asking whether Vu could “come over … now”. Vu replied:
	


“I found [not transcribed] so I checked with you, nothing was happening, therefore I went back to CANBERRA to see my son. I won’t be able to come back up until tomorrow morning.” (White 171)


	
	Le responded:
	


“I already said to you not to you-know-what at all [not transcribed] alright then. So tomorrow morning, alright?”


	
	Vu said that he would “be back early tomorrow morning”.
	
	
	The appellant said in her evidence that she drove to Canberra with Vu as she intended “to help him to drive back to see my son and then I go back here and then I’m off with my friend and he do what he [answer not completed]”.
	


9 February 2012


	
	The appellant and Vu arrived back in Sydney at about 11:15 am. Vu telephoned Le and told him he had arrived back and had “set time” with “them”. Le said, “just ring me up whenever you finish”. Vu responded, saying, “No now I need it … beforehand”.
	
	
	They arranged to meet in half an hour. It was apparent from the next telephone call, which occurred about 12:11 pm, that Vu had understood the meeting place to be The Star casino, whereas Le had intended that Vu come to his convenience store in Newtown. When the misunderstanding was realised, Le went to The Star and Vu followed him back to the convenience store in Newtown. The appellant was with Vu at The Star and at all times thereafter until her arrest at Punchbowl.
	
	
	Surveillance video footage was taken of Vu, Le and the appellant at the convenience store from 12:54 pm, sitting at a table outside the shop. Le was observed going inside the shop and returning with a Mission Tortilla chip bag which he placed on the table. As they were leaving, Vu picked up the bag and carried it to his vehicle. As they left, Le walked for a little distance with Vu. The appellant followed, initially at a distance, but caught up with him by the time they crossed the road and got into the vehicle. The appellant stated in her ERISP that she had a cup of coffee and a cigarette at the convenience store but neither she nor Vu spoke to anyone (Q/A 124, 128, 129).
	
	
	Police kept Vu and the appellant under surveillance until they reached Vu’s sister’s house in Punchbowl.
	
	
	When stopped at Punchbowl, the appellant was asked a number of questions by Police, including about when she had seen the Mission Tortilla chip bag. She said:
	


“[Appellant]   When I’m in the car.

[Officer]   Okay and when was that, where had you been?

[Appellant]   When had I been?

[Officer]   Yeah.

[Appellant]   I drive around, go have coffee.

[Officer]   Where did you have coffee ?

[Appellant]   Star.”

The appellant did not mention the Le convenience store.


	
	She said in her ERISP that a man whom she did not know came and spoke to them at the Casino and they went down to the car park on the same escalator. She said she didn’t know if it was a meeting as she “just follow” Vu (White 228). She also said in her ERISP that they went “home”. When asked whether they stopped on the way home, she said they went for coffee but that she did not know where, as “I’ve never been up here and it’s all new to me”.
	
	
	In her ERISP, the appellant said that she noticed the Mission Tortilla chip bag in the car and saw chips in it through the cellophane window but did not know where the bag came from (Q/A 144, 148, 150). She said she did not know there were drugs in the Mission Tortilla chip bag until she was told by police. She said that when the bag hit her leg, she assumed it was “just chips” as she saw the writing on the bag and chips through the window of the bag (Q/A 145, 171-2, 182). She said that when they left the convenience store, Vu was not carrying anything, and that she was sure about that (Q/A 187-189).
	
	
	In her evidence, the appellant said that she had come back to Sydney “to help [Vu] to drive the car” (White 469). When asked what she did when she got to The Star casino, she said, “I think I have coffee at the Star”. She said she could not remember if she met anybody. Her evidence in chief continued:
	


“Q. Do you remember you gave an interview to the police?

A. WITNESS: Yes.

Q. You told the police in the interview --

A. WITNESS: Yes.

Q. -- that you met someone and he was going down the escalators?

A. WITNESS: Playing with my phone.

…

Q. During the time that you were there did you listen to the conversation or any conversation that Mr Vu was having with this man?

A. WITNESS: Yes.

Q. Do you remember what was being said?

A. WITNESS: No.

Q. As you got into the car did you notice anything in the car in the foot well?

A. WITNESS: No.

…

Q. Did you see Mr Vu carrying anything?

A. WITNESS: No.

…

Q. And you said you were asked [by police] when you went to the café did Mr Vu speak to any other people, and you said no, you know that’s no true?

A. WITNESS: Yes.

Q. Why did you say that to the police.

A. WITNESS: I was scared that time.

…

Q. In your record of interview, just one other question, you were asked by the police did you ever see the man Mr Le. You said you never met him before.

A. WITNESS: Yes.

Q. You now know that’s not true?

A. WITNESS: Yes.

…

Q. Why did you tell the police that?

A. WITNESS: Because I only met him in five minutes so it doesn’t occur to me.”


	
	The appellant denied she had come to Sydney with Vu to obtain drugs or had at any time agreed to be involved with him in obtaining drugs. Her cross-examination included the following evidence as to what occurred at the convenience store:
	


“Q. And did you have a conversation with Mr Le or Mr Vu while you were there?

A. WITNESS: No.

Q. Did they speak to each other?

A. WITNESS: Yes.

Q. Can you recall what they said?

A. WITNESS: I didn’t pay attention.

Q. Right what were you doing?

A. WITNESS: Playing with my phone.

…

Q. Did you speak to Mr Le at all?

A. WITNESS: No.

…

Q. Can you recall anything that was said while you were seated at the convenience store?

A. WITNESS: I wasn’t paying any attention.

Q. Did you notice Mr Le get up, go inside and then come back with a bag of chips?

A. WITNESS: I don’t pay attention to that either.

Q. Did you see a bag of chips on the table at any stage?

A. WITNESS: I don’t pay attention at all.

Q. Did you hear Mr Le suggest that you might want to have a chip with your coffee?

A. WITNESS: I can’t remember.

A. WITNESS: When they making a turn.

…

Q. And how did you notice it?

A. WITNESS: It rub against my leg.

…

Q. Why were you scared [when the police stopped the vehicle at Punchbowl]?

A. WITNESS: Suddenly the police come up and show me the bag and say ‘There’s drug in there’ but I don’t know anything about that.

Q. Well why should you be scared, you had nothing to do with it?

A. WITNESS: I never been in trouble before so --

Q. So why didn’t you tell the police about having stopped at Mr Le’s convenience store?

A. WITNESS: At that time it doesn’t recall.”

The appellant denied she was part of the scheme for Vu to obtain drugs from Le.


	
	Vu, in his ERISP, said that Le had offered them some chips at the convenience store but they didn’t eat them. He said he took the bag with him when they left. He said to the appellant, “[w]ho going to eat these chips?”. He said he then threw the bag into the car “on her side” as he was driving (Q/A 128, 135, 137). He said that he did not look inside the bag. In response to the question about the bag being “heavier than a normal paper bag with some corn chips in it”, he responded, “I, honestly I don’t give, know about that” (Q/A 143). In the ERISP, Vu explained the appellant’s presence with him on the basis that they were “try[ing] to be a little bit like, closer” (Q/A 153).
	
	
	In his evidence at trial, Vu said that his telephone calls with Le related to arranging girls for the following weekend. In his cross-examination, Vu denied that the appellant was involved in his conversation with Le at the convenience store and said she was playing with her phone. He said that Le put a bag of chips on the table and said:
	


“…okay I know you got hungry but sorry I can’t go out for lunch with you, leave for next time and just take a bag of chip with you in the meantime if you hungry in the car you can have something to eat.”

Vu said he replied:

“First I say ‘no I don’t eat chip’ and just because he keep telling me to take it, by respect the oldest I take it with me.”

The Crown case at trial


	
	The Crown case against the appellant was based upon her activities in travelling to Melbourne, where Vu resided, and then remaining in his company from 6 February 2012 up until the time they were arrested on 9 February 2012, and on lies she told the police. There was no evidence of telephone calls between the appellant and Le or between the appellant and Vu, nor was she mentioned in any of the telephone calls between Vu and Le.
	


First ground of appeal: failing to direct the jury that the Crown was required to prove that the appellant knew a commercial quantity was involved in the offence


	
	Knowledge that a commercial quantity of a particular drug is involved is an essential element of the offence in question: R v Lau (1998) 105 A Crim R 167 at [174]; R v Micalizzi [2004] NSWCCA 406 at [17], [42]. The Crown accepted that the trial judge erred in failing to direct the jury of this: Ka Chung Fung v R [2007] NSWCCA 250 at [42].
	
	
	The appellant’s counsel at trial did not seek a direction, redirection or further direction on this point. Accordingly, the Criminal Appeal Rules (NSW), r 4 applies and leave is required to raise this ground of appeal. A party seeking leave needs to establish that there may have been a miscarriage of justice arising from the error at trial: R v Moussa [2001] NSWCCA 427; 125 A Crim R 505 at [63] per Howie J (Giles JA and Carruthers AJ agreeing).
	
	
	The appellant submitted that leave to appeal on this ground ought to be granted as a failure to give the jury a direction in respect of an essential element of the offence will generally give rise to a miscarriage of justice. The Crown did not oppose the grant of leave.
	
	
	In Fung, Latham J (Spigelman CJ and Kirby J agreeing) stated, at [48], that where a trial judge:
	


“… [fails] to direct [a jury] correctly or at all in relation to the elements of an offence … an applicant will generally be able to persuade the Court that a miscarriage of justice may have occurred…: see R v Gulliford [[2004] NSWCCA 338; 148 A Crim R 558 at 579].”


	
	In Gulliford, Wood CJ at CL (Spigelman CJ agreeing on this point, Howie J agreeing) stated, at [113], “the giving of correct directions on elements of an offence are important to a fair trial”. Leave was thus granted pursuant to r 4 to argue a ground of appeal relating to a failure to direct the jury of the essential elements of the offence charged.
	
	
	In the present case, the failure to direct the jury that knowledge of the quantity of the drug was an essential element of the offence was a serious omission. For that reason, leave to appeal should be given to raise this ground of appeal. Although the Crown did not oppose the grant of leave to raise this ground of appeal, it submitted that a misdirection as to an element of an offence does not automatically give rise to a substantial miscarriage of justice for the purposes of the proviso pursuant to the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), s 6(1) and that it was open to the Court to apply the provisions of the Criminal Appeal Act, s 7(2).
	
	
	In Baiada Poultry Pty Ltd v The Queen [2012] HCA 14; 246 CLR 92 at [31], the plurality observed that the proviso to s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act ought seldom to be applied where the jury had not been sufficiently directed of the need to be satisfied to the requisite standard of an element of the offence with which the accused person is charged. However, the Crown argued that in the present case, the appellant would inevitably have been convicted on the same evidence at trial if the jury had been properly directed that the appellant knew that the quantity of the drug involved was of greater than a commercial quantity. The Crown relied, for the purposes of proving knowledge that a commercial quantity of the drug was involved, upon the telephone conversations between Vu and Le on 4 February, as enabling the jury to infer that the discussions concerning the purity of the drug and the provision of a sample established that Vu was of the knowledge or belief that the transaction concerned a significant amount of heroin. The Crown relied upon the appellant being engaged in a joint criminal enterprise with Vu to supply a significant quantity of heroin.
	
	
	We do not agree that the evidence was sufficient to establish beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant had knowledge of the quantity of drug involved. Even if the evidence was sufficient to implicate the appellant with knowledge that a delivery of drugs was being or had been organised, there was no evidence that implicated her with knowledge of the quantity of drugs. She was not party to any of the telephone calls between Vu and Le. There was no evidence of any other telephone calls that may have implicated her in the offence. She was not overheard to say anything to Vu or Le in relation to the drugs. She did not handle the Mission Tortilla chip bag. There was nothing about the bag itself sufficient to indicate that the drug was of the prescribed commercial quantity of 250 g. The Crown’s submission in this regard should therefore be rejected.
	
	
	The Crown submitted, alternatively, that if the Court was not satisfied that the appellant would have been convicted of the charge of supply of not less than a commercial quantity of a prohibited drug on the evidence presented at trial, it was nonetheless open to the court to enter a substituted verdict against the appellant pursuant to the Criminal Appeal Act, s 7(2). That section provides:
	


“Where an appellant has been convicted of an offence, and the jury could on the indictment have found the appellant guilty of some other offence, and on the finding of the jury it appears to the court that the jury must have been satisfied of facts which proved the appellant guilty of that other offence, the court may, instead of allowing or dismissing the appeal, substitute for the verdict found by the jury a verdict of guilty of that other offence, and pass such sentence in substitution for the sentence passed at the trial as may be warranted in law for that other offence, not being a sentence of greater severity.”


	
	In Mehajer v R [2014] NSWCCA 167 Bathurst CJ noted that the power conferred on the Court by s 7(2) was to be exercised “with great caution”. In his Honour’s view, expressed at [138], the power conferred by s 7(2) was most likely to be exercised where the offence was wholly within the ultimate facts on which the accused person was convicted. His Honour added that:
	


“Where the ground for setting aside a conviction is a misdirection the section can only apply where the Court holds that the jury must have been satisfied as to facts underlying the conviction which are unaffected by the misdirection and which constitute the other offence.”


	
	The Crown submitted that in this case the substitute verdict would be an offence of supplying a prohibited drug contrary to s 25(1) of the Act. The elements of that offence were, on the Crown’s submission, wholly encompassed within the elements of the offence under s 25(2). Further, the alternative offence under s 25(1) was open on the indictment as it is a statutory alternative to an offence under s 25(2): see s 25(3). The Crown submitted that the jury’s verdict of guilty of an offence contrary to s 25(2) of the Act meant that the jury had found the elements of the alternative charge established at trial and were satisfied of facts that constituted the alternative offence unaffected by the misdirection.
	
	
	There may have been merit in the Crown case were it not for the conclusion to which we have come in respect of ground 2. For the reasons which appear hereunder, we are of the opinion that the verdict of the jury should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence.
	


Ground 2: the verdict is unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence


	
	The test to be applied in determining whether the verdict is unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence is well-established. Subject to replacing the words “unsafe or unsatisfactory” with the statutory formulation in the Criminal Appeal Act, s 6(1), of “unreasonable, or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence”: see MFA v R [2002] HCA 53; 213 CLR 606, at [25], the principle, as stated in M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; 181 CLR 487 at 493, is as follows:
	


“Where, notwithstanding that as a matter of law there is evidence to sustain a verdict, a court of criminal appeal is asked to conclude that the verdict is unsafe or unsatisfactory, the question which the court must ask itself is whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty.” (citation omitted)


	
	In SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; 243 CLR 400 the High Court stated:
	


“[12]   This test has been restated to reflect the terms of s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act. In MFA v The Queen McHugh, Gummow and Kirby JJ stated that the reference to ‘unsafe or unsatisfactory’ in M is to be taken as ‘equivalent to the statutory formula referring to the impugned verdict as ‘unreasonable’ or such as ‘cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence’.’

[13]   The starting point in the application of s 6(1) is that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, and the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses. However, the joint judgment in M went on to say:

‘In most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced. It is only where a jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a court of criminal appeal that the court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred.’” (citation omitted)


	
	The appellant submitted that the case against her was wholly circumstantial. Those circumstances, in summary, were as follows:
	


“a.   The content of the intercepted phone calls between Le and Vu on 4, 7, 8 and 9 February 2012;

b.   The fact that the appellant accompanied Vu over the period preceding the transaction and until their arrest;

c.   The presence and conduct of the appellant during the meeting at the Star on 7 February 2012;

d.   The presence and conduct of the appellant at the convenience store when the drugs were collected on 9 February 2012;

e.   The location of the drugs in relation to the appellant at the time the car was stopped and searched; and

f.   The statements of the appellant in conversation with police at the time the car was stopped and searched and in interview regarding her movements.” (Apps subs (36)


	
	The appellant submitted that these factors, taken singly or together, were such that there was a reasonable possibility that she was not a party to a joint criminal enterprise to possess the drugs for the purpose of supply.
	
	
	One factor to which the appellant points which we consider to be of particular significance in respect of the circumstantial case against her, was that not only was there no reference to her in any of the telephone calls, in those conversations Vu always spoke in the first person singular. Nor, as has been indicated, was there any evidence of the appellant being engaged in any telephone conversations with Le or Vu at all.
	
	
	The appellant also explained why it was that she was in Vu’s company in the days preceding the arrest. However, leaving aside her explanation, there was no evidence that demonstrated that the appellant was involved with Vu or otherwise implicated in his dealings with Le in respect of the drugs. The fact that the appellant was only with Vu and Le for about seven minutes of their half hour plus meeting on 7 February pointed to her lack of involvement or participation in any arrangements relating to the drugs, rather than implicating her in any such arrangements.
	
	
	There was no evidence as to what was said at that meeting. Unlike the position with Vu, there was no evidence that she had been in contact with any person to whom the drugs were to be provided. The appellant’s interaction with Le in handing him a phone was of little moment. The surveillance officer’s attention was distracted momentarily whilst observing the group and he did not see where the phone came from or how it came to be in the appellant’s possession. For all that is known, it could have been handed to the appellant by Vu or by Le to show her something on it.
	
	
	The appellant also submitted that there was nothing in the surveillance evidence of her, Vu and Le at the convenience store that demonstrated that she was involved in obtaining the drugs. She pointed out that as they left the video store, Vu and Le were a little way in front of her, suggesting that she was not involved in their dealings. As was demonstrated on the video evidence, by the time she caught up with Vu, Le had moved off in another direction. No fingerprints or DNA of hers was found on the Mission Tortilla chip bag, notwithstanding that the bag was found in the footwell of the vehicle where she was seated as a passenger. This might be seen as an indication that she had no interest in the bag or involvement with the drugs in it, even if she knew or suspected what its contents were.
	
	
	The Crown submitted, however, that on the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the appellant’s guilt, in accordance with the principles discussed above. In particular, it submitted the Court would be satisfied on the evidence that it was open to the jury, properly instructed, to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of all elements of the offence charged including the element of knowledge that the heroin was more than 250 g.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the telephone call between Vu and Le on 4 February was capable of establishing that Vu was negotiating with Le to obtain a significant quantity of heroin. The Crown then argued that the appellant’s involvement in a joint criminal enterprise with Vu in obtaining a significant quantity of heroin was supported by their personal arrangements in the days prior to 9 February.
	
	
	In this regard, the Crown argued that the appellant, who was not shown to be a person of great financial means, travelled from Canberra to Melbourne to Sydney to Canberra and back to Sydney within five days. The Crown contended that the brevity of the visit to Canberra on 8 February followed by the early morning departure on 9 February, demonstrated some urgency and purpose in returning to Sydney. Once in Sydney, the appellant and Vu met immediately with Le whom they had already met on 7 February.
	
	
	However, the following responses may be made to those arguments. First, the appellant’s evidence was that her boyfriend Tim paid for her airfare and Vu said that his oldest daughter paid for his trip on her Visa card. Secondly, the trip to Canberra was made in a car owned by Vu’s sister. There was no suggestion of any cost to the appellant. Thirdly, there were plausible reasons that explained the appellant’s presence in Melbourne, the trip to Sydney and the visit to Canberra. There was also a plausible reason why the appellant travelled back to Sydney from Canberra. The appellant said that she had travelled to Canberra with Vu to help with the driving and that she had done the same on the return. She said that she had returned to Sydney to attend Vietnamese New Year celebrations.
	
	
	The Crown further submitted that, from the time she was apprehended, the appellant made significant efforts to distance herself from Le, which was inconsistent with her innocent explanations for her movements. In particular, the Crown contended that the appellant lied when the police first confronted her at Punchbowl, when she said that she had had coffee that morning at The Star. This, of course, was false. She had had coffee at the convenience store.
	
	
	The appellant contended that the capacity of this wrong statement to show that she had deliberately lied because she feared implicating herself was doubtful as, in her ERISP, she correctly stated that she had had a coffee at a café after having left The Star casino (Apps subs (42)). The Crown submitted that this ‘correction’ did not neutralise her false statement to the police because the appellant also stated in her ERISP that neither she nor Vu spoke to anyone else at the cafe at the convenience store. This in turn was false. (Erisp Q and A 128-9).
	
	
	The Crown also relied upon further ‘misstatements’ made by the appellant where, in her ERISP, she said that Vu had met a friend at The Star casino on the morning of 9 February, possibly by coincidence. She said that she was not introduced to the friend, nor had she previously known him. In her oral evidence at trial, the appellant explained that in giving those answers, she had not thought of having met Le on 7 February, because as she said, “I only met him in five minutes so it didn’t occur to me”.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the appellant’s continued efforts to distance herself from Le lent weight to its contention that the appellant’s original lie to the police on 9 February was deliberate and of significance.
	
	
	A lie is not necessarily evidence of guilt. In Edwards v R [1993] HCA 63; 178 CLR 193 at 209, Deane, Dawson and Gaudron JJ stated, at 209:
	


“… not every lie told by an accused provides evidence probative of guilt. It is only if the accused is telling a lie because he perceives that the truth is inconsistent with his innocence that the telling of the lie may constitute evidence against him. In other words, in telling the lie the accused must be acting as if he were guilty. It must be a lie which an innocent person would not tell. That is why the lie must be deliberate. Telling an untruth inadvertently cannot be indicative of guilt. And the lie must relate to a material issue because the telling of it must be explicable only on the basis that the truth would implicate the accused in the offence with which he is charged. It must be for that reason that he tells the lie. To say that the lie must spring from a realization or consciousness of guilt is really another way of saying the same thing. It is to say that the accused must be lying because he is conscious that ‘if he tells the truth, the truth will convict him’.” (citations omitted)


	
	See also Eade v The King (1924) 34 CLR 154 at 158 per Knox CJ, Gavan Duffy and Starke JJ; Zoneff v The Queen [2000] HCA 28; 200 CLR 234 at [57]-[58] per Kirby J; Doggett v The Queen [2001] HCA 46; 208 CLR 343 at [69] per McHugh J; and R v Heyde (1990) 20 NSWLR 234 at 242-244 per Clarke JA.
	
	
	The appellant gave explanations as to why she had not been completely truthful when she spoke to police at the scene of her arrest and in her ERISP. It was a matter for the jury whether to accept those explanations. Whilst the appellant’s false statements may have indicated that she was attempting to distance herself from the drug transaction, they were also consistent with her having some understanding that Vu and Le were involved in an unlawful activity involving drugs. However, of itself, it did not establish that the appellant and Vu were jointly in possession of the drugs or that she had any knowledge of the quantity of drugs involved.
	
	
	Having read all the evidence and watched the video evidence we each find ourselves having a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the appellant of the offence charged. Although her presence with Vu during this period certainly raises a suspicion as to what she was doing, and the circumstances in which the drug was delivered to Vu may mean that there was a reasonably available inference that the appellant knew that there was some illegal drug activity occurring, we have a reasonable doubt that the appellant was guilty of the offence charged.
	
	
	There is another matter of importance which must not be left unstated. Suspicion or perhaps awareness by the appellant of the involvement of Vu and Le in a drug transaction, but without any personal interest let alone participation, was a viable explanation for the appellant's conduct, particularly her false statements. However, this was not ventilated before the jury by anyone. The only asserted hypotheses advanced by the parties were knowing involvement or complete ignorance of the activities of Vu and Le.
	
	
	Regardless of how a trial is conducted by an accused person, the trial judge “must be astute to secure for the accused a fair trial according to law”: Pemble v The Queen [1971] HCA 20; 124 CLR 107 at 116 per Barwick CJ. The fundamental principle that governs a criminal trial is that to convict, a jury must be satisfied that the facts were inconsistent with any rational conclusion other than that the accused was guilty. In other words, the circumstances must be “inconsistent with any reasonable hypothesis other than the guilt of the accused”: Peacock v The King [1911] HCA 66; 13 CLR 619 at 634. In Pemble, at 117-8 Barwick CJ added:
	


Whatever course counsel may see fit to take, no doubt bona fide but for tactical reasons in what he considers the best interest of his client, the trial judge must be astute to secure for the accused a fair trial according to law. This involves, in my opinion, an adequate direction both as to the law and the possible use of the relevant facts upon any matter upon which the jury could in the circumstances of the case upon the material before them find or base a verdict in whole or in part.


	
	This is not to say that in every circumstantial evidence case there is a requirement for a trial judge to search for any rational hypothesis inconsistent with guilt that may not have been raised by counsel. Whether there is a need for a trial judge to draw to the jury's attention the possible existence of any such hypothesis very much depends upon the facts and circumstances of the case at hand: see the discussion in R v Sung Eun Park [2003] NSWCCA 203 at [43]ff per Shaw J, Ipp JA and Buddin J agreeing.
	
	
	This point was not one relied upon by the appellant and so there is no need to say more about it.
	
	
	Having reached the conclusion that it was not open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt as to the appellant's guilt, the Court makes the following orders:
	



	
	Grant leave to appeal.
	
	
	Allow the appeal
	
	
	Quash the appellant’s conviction and enter a verdict of acquittal.
	
	
	Order that the appellant be released forthwith.

2703513,R v Kelsall [2015] NSWSC 480,"Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: Daniel Jack Kelsall (""the offender"") is to be sentenced for the indecent assault and murder of Mr Morgan Huxley at Neutral Bay on 8 September 2013. He was found guilty of these offences by a jury on 18 March 2015.
	
	
	Murder is a crime for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for life. There is also prescribed for it (in the circumstances of this case) a standard non-parole period of 20 years. Indecent assault is an offence carrying a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 5 years.
	


Facts


	
	Morgan Huxley, a 31 year old single man, lived in a two storey unit located on the ground floor of a unit complex in Watson Street, Neutral Bay, a short distance from Military Road. He shared the unit with his flatmate, Jean Redmond. Mr Huxley and Ms Redmond had separate rooms which were upstairs and adjacent to each other. He owned a company called Huxley Marine where he worked as a wharf engineer.
	
	
	The offender worked as a kitchen hand at the Sydney Cooking School which is located on Military Road, Neutral Bay, opposite The Oaks hotel. He lived with his parents in Spruson Street, Neutral Bay, less than 1.5 km away.
	
	
	The offender told a doctor in May 2012 that he had experienced intrusive (in the sense of recurring and persistent) thoughts about killing people with a knife on his way home at night. He said there was no real reason for it and he had not thought about the consequences. He said he had taken a knife home late one night but had not met anyone. The following month he told a psychiatrist that he had experienced thoughts about killing someone with a knife and that it would be “for the thrill of it”. The victim would be someone he described as ""a total random"". He said he had no idea why he had these thoughts and that he did not want to kill anyone.
	
	
	On the afternoon of 7 September 2013 Mr Huxley drove to Lane Cove to attend an engagement party for some close friends. He was at the party for a number of hours, drinking alcohol and socialising. At the end of the party, at around 12.30am, he and two friends caught a taxi to Neutral Bay. Mr Huxley got out of the taxi on Watson Street and walked alone, towards The Oaks hotel on the corner of Military Road and Ben Boyd Road for one last drink.
	
	
	The offender finished work in the early hours of 8 September 2013 and went to some take-away food shops on Ben Boyd Road opposite the hotel. He encountered Mr Huxley, who was a stranger to him, when he entered a convenience store to buy a drink and where Mr Huxley was attempting to use an ATM. They spoke briefly. The offender said in his evidence in the trial that he could smell alcohol but could not tell if Mr Huxley was drunk. He said he thought Mr Huxley was good looking but he did not find him ""overly attractive"".
	
	
	The offender lingered on the footpath for the next half an hour or so chatting to a security guard. He saw Mr Huxley cross the road and attempt to enter the hotel via one entrance but he was turned away by security staff. He watched as Mr Huxley went back across Ben Boyd Road but then returned to the hotel and entered by a different door. The offender remarked to the security guard that Mr Huxley was not wearing shoes.
	
	
	CCTV footage showed Mr Huxley entering The Oaks hotel at 1.01am, drinking a beer, leaving at 1.28am, and walking in the direction of his home. The footage also showed the offender leaving his location in Ben Boyd Road a short time after Mr Huxley left the hotel. He followed Mr Huxley, at times breaking into a jog so as to catch up. He was immediately behind Mr Huxley as he crossed at the lights at the Military Road and Watson Street intersection. It was not captured on camera but I am satisfied that the offender followed Mr Huxley on his short walk along Watson Street to his ground-floor unit and observed him entering the unit.
	
	
	Ms Redmond gave evidence of hearing Mr Huxley come home and go to his bedroom at about 1.30am. She tried to get back to sleep. The next thing she heard was what she thought was a knock on the front door but she was not sure. She then heard a second and louder knock. I think it is reasonable to infer that this was the offender knocking, probably not realising at that point that the door was unlocked. (Mr Huxley was in the habit of leaving his front door unlocked.) Ms Redmond chose to ignore the knocking, assuming that it was a friend of Mr Huxley's, and tried to get back to sleep. I am satisfied that the offender must have tried the door handle, found it was unlocked, and then entered.
	
	
	After entering the unit, the offender went upstairs where he found the deceased lying on his bed either asleep or incapacitated by alcohol. He stabbed Mr Huxley repeatedly in his back, head and neck with a knife that I am satisfied he had been carrying in his bag. Mr Huxley must have been alert to what was happening as he sustained some defensive wounds. The offender also pulled down Mr Huxley’s shorts and in some fashion touched his penis. The parties agree that the indecent assault preceded the stabbing.
	
	
	The offender left Mr Huxley’s apartment and returned to his home in Spruson Street, Neutral Bay. He disposed of the knife at a time and place unknown.
	
	
	The next thing Ms Redmond heard was at about 2.30am. She heard some shuffling around in Mr Huxley's room and noises she likened to the scratching of chalk on a blackboard. There was a fall or a thump and some mumbling noises. She then heard snoring noises, but they were louder than what she thought would be normal. This continued for about 5 minutes so she decided to get up and investigate. She found Mr Huxley covered in blood and with a stab wound to his neck, lying on the floor in the doorway of his bedroom. His shorts were pulled down exposing his penis.
	
	
	The noises Ms Redmond heard must have been caused by Mr Huxley getting up from where he had been stabbed on his bed, shuffling towards the doorway and then collapsing. He would have been struggling to breathe.
	
	
	Ms Redmond attempted to perform CPR until ambulance officers arrived. The officers observed a large puncture wound to the neck and a number of stab wounds on the torso, upper arms, back and head. There was also a significant amount of blood on the bed. Mr Huxley was taken to Royal North Shore Hospital but was pronounced dead shortly after arrival.
	
	
	An autopsy examination determined that Mr Huxley had died as the direct result of multiple stab wounds inflicted by a sharp knife. The forensic pathologist was able to identify more than 20 discrete stab wounds to the middle and upper back, neck and head. The injuries included internal haemorrhaging, penetration of the chest cavity, injury to the lungs, severing of the carotid artery and damage to the jugular vein. A post mortem x-ray revealed a small piece of metal deeply embedded in the skull. A routine toxicology test revealed a blood alcohol level of 0.220.
	
	
	Police recovered CCTV footage from wherever it was available in and around The Oaks hotel. They quickly determined that a male had followed Mr Huxley as he walked home from the hotel. On 24 September 2013 they succeeded in identifying the male as Daniel Kelsall who worked nearby at the Sydney Cooking School and who was not previously known to police. They went to his home and spoke with him. He agreed to accompany them to North Sydney police station where he voluntarily participated in an interview.
	
	
	The offender adopted an air of helpfulness but he told the police what were later conceded to be a series of lies regarding his movements after he finished work on 8 September. He claimed that he returned to the Sydney Cooking School after being at the take-away shops on Ben Boyd Road because he had forgotten to turn off a light. He said that he just happened to walk behind the deceased along Military Road as he went back to work. He said that he was cold, which is why he could be seen jogging outside The Oaks hotel on the CCTV footage. He said that on his way home he took a circuitous route, stopping to look through items which had been left on the street by householders for an imminent council clean-up. (He has since explained that he told this lie in anticipation that his parents, with whom he lived, might tell police he was later than expected arriving home or that security cameras at his unit complex would be checked.) He denied ever having been in the deceased’s unit or knowing anything about the murder.
	
	
	The offender was arrested on 8 October 2013 on which occasion he declined to be interviewed. In the intervening period, police had determined that his DNA was on the deceased's penis, his fingerprints were on the bedroom door and that spots of blood from the deceased were on his shoulder bag. He had made an unsuccessful attempt to clean the spots from the bag.
	
	
	The offender's evidence in the trial entailed him giving a version that was markedly different to that which he had told police. He claimed that he had been invited by Mr Huxley into the unit. They were engaging in consensual sexual activity in the bedroom when one or more intruders entered and attacked Mr Huxley. The offender said that he simply fled and told no-one. It is little wonder that the jury rejected this account.
	


Personal history of the offender


	
	I have before me reports by psychiatrists, Dr Olav Nielssen and Dr Adam Martin, and psychologists, Dr Abdul Saad and Dr Susan Pulman. The offender did not give evidence in the sentencing proceedings.
	
	
	The offender was aged 20 at the time of the offences. He was born in Wellington, New Zealand, in February 1993 and was adopted at birth. His parents adopted two other children; he has an 18 year old sister and a 27 year old brother. He was brought up in what appears to have been a loving and supportive family environment and he remains close to his parents.
	
	
	He reported difficulties at school but these seem to have been confined to him being separated from his friends when he, or they, transferred to other classes or schools. His secondary education ended when the Montessori school he was attending closed down. He attempted to complete his education by correspondence but this was unsuccessful, apparently because he had concentration issues and was easily distracted.
	
	
	At age 17 he enrolled in a hospitality course at a college, undertaking a 12 month full-time Food Preparation and Culinary Arts Certificate before commencing an apprenticeship as a chef. Half way through the year his parents and sister moved to Sydney in order for his father to establish a business. His brother had moved out of home so he went to live with a relative of a family friend. He has said that he found this period of separation from his parents to be difficult and he became depressed.
	
	
	He joined his family in Sydney after the completion of his course. He attempted to pursue a career as a chef but found he was unsuitable because he had difficulties with measurements and could not understand the subtleties of things such as ""a pinch of salt"". Ultimately he took the position as a kitchen hand / cleaner at the Sydney Cooking School.
	
	
	The offender told Dr Nielssen that he became aware of his homosexual orientation in early high school however he did not become sexually active until his late teenage years. He had never had a long term relationship. He said that none of his sexual encounters had resulted in any kind of danger or violence.
	
	
	The offender described himself to the psychiatrists as a “nerd” or a “geek”. (His father agreed with the description in his evidence in the trial. He also agreed that his son was socially awkward and was interested more in intellectual than physical pursuits such as sports.) The offender said he liked role-playing games, competitive card games, Pokémon and video games. He also enjoyed reading fantasy and science fiction novels and playing chess.
	


Mental health history


	
	Dr Nielssen reviewed records of a general practitioner and psychiatrist from the Petone Medical Centre in Lower Hutt, New Zealand who the offender had consulted in late 2010. The general practitioner’s notes included discussion of sleep disturbance, thoughts of suicide and “also states has enjoyed inflicting pain on others in past”. The offender was prescribed an antidepressant and an urgent referral was made to a mental health team.
	
	
	The psychiatrist wrote that he was inclined to a diagnosis of bipolar disorder on the basis of a history of symptoms of depression and an elevated mood which had been triggered by taking the antidepressant. The psychiatrist prescribed a low dose of Seroquel (an antipsychotic and mood stabilizing medication). When he was reviewed on his second appointment it was noted that this had been helpful. When he was last reviewed in early December 2010 he was discharged from crisis team care and provided with three months' supply of the medication.
	
	
	After moving to Sydney at the end of 2010 the offender continued to take Seroquel and increased the dose on medical advice.
	
	
	In September 2011 his general practitioner referred him to a psychiatrist who he saw only once. That doctor told him that he did not have bipolar but was “just depressed”. He was advised to continue on the Seroquel if it provided relief for his symptoms.
	
	
	When he saw his GP in February 2012 to obtain another prescription for Seroquel he was told that it was not available for him under the PBS for a person in his situation. He weaned off that drug over a month and was advised to see a psychiatrist.
	
	
	The offender saw Dr Susan Allman, general practitioner, on 15 May 2012. Her notes included the possibility that the offender might have ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) and “mild Asperger’s with co-morbid depression”. She also recorded in her notes of the consultation the account of the offender having experienced intrusive thoughts about killing people with a knife on his way home at night.
	
	
	Dr Matthew Boulton, psychiatrist at the Mindcare Centre at Broadway, saw the offender upon referral from Dr Allman on 6 June 2012. His notes included a record of the offender again saying that he had experienced thoughts of killing someone. He told Dr Boulton, “it sounds psychopathic” and that he experienced these thoughts when his depression had been at its worst; it had helped that he was on antidepressants prescribed over the past month by Dr Allman.
	
	
	Dr Boulton referred the offender to Dr Abdul Saad, psychologist. He saw Dr Saad at approximately monthly intervals with the last consultation on 17 September 2013.
	
	
	Dr Saad said that from his first session with the offender on 19 June 2012 he found him somewhat difficult to engage. He thought that the offender was someone for whom anger was part of his internal psychic world; a sort of defence mechanism to keep him from feeling his emotions, but that it did not cross over into real life and pose a threat to himself or others.
	
	
	Dr Saad said that during the course of ten treatment sessions the offender could be difficult to engage. Discussions with him provided little opportunity to penetrate deeper into his psychic life. He did, however, deny any significant feelings of anxiety or depression and there was no evidence of thoughts of self harm or homicidal ideas.
	
	
	Based on the offender’s presentation during the course of the treatment sessions, his self-reporting and background history, Dr Saad assessed his risk status, to himself and others, as low. However, after being informed that the offender had been charged with Mr Huxley’s murder, Dr Saad said that if the charge was proved, then “considerable weight would be added to the view that Mr Kelsall exhibits significant callous-unemotional traits.” He added that “such traits are not an integral aspect of either an ADHD or Autism Spectrum Disorder”.
	
	
	Dr Nielssen made three diagnoses: possible bipolar disorder; possible autism spectrum disorder; and possible emerging psychotic illness.
	
	
	Dr Nielssen explained that the possible bipolar disorder diagnosis was made on the basis of a history of periods of depression and of elevated mood triggered by taking antidepressant medication. There was also the history of some improvement after treatment with sedating antipsychotic medication indicated for bipolar disorder, and aspects of the offender’s presentation at the time of his initial interview in October 2013 when Dr Nielssen thought the offender had an abnormally elevated mood considering his then present circumstances.
	
	
	The diagnosis of possible autism spectrum disorder was considered by Dr Nielssen on the basis of the offender’s history of problems with learning and social adjustment in his childhood and adolescence; the reported diagnosis of his treating psychologist and at least two psychiatrists; and aspects of his presentation during Dr Nielssen’s three interviews when the offender’s communication and emotional responses seemed incongruous to his situation.
	
	
	At this point of his report, Dr Nielssen noted that the offender’s presentation was unusual in that he was outwardly cheerful and polite and fluent in his communication and did not have the typical feature of autism (a lack of interest in social contact). The doctor noted, however, that he agreed with the impressions of other clinicians that the offender’s condition might be best described as autism spectrum disorder, which can be accompanied by a reduced capacity for empathy.
	
	
	Dr Nielssen explained that the diagnosis of a possible emerging psychotic illness was also considered on the basis of the offender’s history of adoption; of learning problems in childhood; the reported assessment by an early psychosis service in New Zealand; the history of mood and neurological symptoms of a type that often precede the emergence of psychosis; and the offender’s “odd affect” which Dr Nielssen considered could also indicate the underlying neuropathy of a schizophrenic illness.
	
	
	Dr Nielssen said the offender did not report symptoms of schizophrenia around the time of the offence or in the year since his arrest and so did not think that he had a psychotic illness such as schizophrenia.
	
	
	Dr Martin considered that the offender could “probably be diagnosed with having Autistic Spectrum Disorder according to DSM-5 criteria”. He explained that this would be referred to as Asperger’s Syndrome in DSM-IV terminology, a less severe autistic disorder. Like Dr Nielssen, he found no evidence suggestive of a major mental illness such as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder.
	
	
	I found Dr Pulman's report particularly thorough and helpful. Refreshingly, she questioned the history she was provided by the offender and indicated where it conflicted with other material, such as the histories set out in the reports of other doctors or the evidence in the trial.
	
	
	Dr Pulman administered a number of psychometric tests which yielded some interesting results. A comprehensive intellectual assessment indicated that the offender's overall level of intellectual functioning fell within the ""Superior range""; meaning that his functioning is at a level equal to or better than 95 per cent of the normal population.
	
	
	In undertaking the vocabulary subtest of this assessment, when asked to provide the meaning of the word ""terminate"", he responded immediately, ""to kill"". She queried him about this because other individuals typically responded with definitions ""to end, to finish, to stop"" and he replied, ""to completely extinguish the life source"". Dr Pulman reported that ""this was an atypical response, even within the incarcerated population with a history of antisocial and aggressive behaviour"".
	
	
	Testing of the offender's attention span, ability to concentrate and to process information resulted in High Average and Superior range scores. There was no evidence of any difficulties with attention, a characteristic of individuals with ADHD.
	
	
	No deficit was found in the offender's ability to learn and remember; the tests for these resulting in High Average range scores.
	
	
	Testing of the offender's ability to deal with new and unusual tasks that require a person to reason, problem solve, check that they are proceeding correctly and modify their behaviour if necessary returned an overall score in the High Average range. One particular task within this test resulted in a Superior range score at the 97th percentile, suggesting accurate measurement, planning and organisational ability.
	
	
	Finally, a test to measure current mood and level of psychological functioning did not reveal any symptoms of depression, anxiety or stress outside of normal limits. That is interesting, given that the testing was carried out only a little more than a week before the offender was due to appear for sentencing on a charge of murder.
	
	
	Dr Pulman referred to the offender's reported history of differential diagnoses including depression, ADHD, autism, and Asperger's. But as she assessed him:
	


""He was articulate, fluent in his conversation, and there was no evidence of any autistic features or symptoms consistent with ADHD or depression. On the contrary, his attention and concentration abilities fell in the Superior range and his mood upbeat, insofar as he appeared to be enjoying the attention and challenge the interview and testing provided.""


	
	Dr Pulman noted that the offender demonstrated obsessive traits and restricted or idiosyncratic behaviours but observed as well that the latter are known to occur in more gifted individuals.
	
	
	She raised doubt about the possible diagnosis of autism and suggested a possible personality disorder with psychopathic traits:
	


""Whilst he demonstrates an understanding of empathy from a cognitive perspective, he appears to have limited emotional resonance or connection with other's emotional experiences. He is detached and composed in his behaviours and, although may appear similar to autistic type behaviours, it is in my professional opinion more consistent with a personality disorder characterised by psychopathic traits. Although there is no prior antisocial history that the writer is aware of, he has described feelings of rage originating in childhood. He reported to medical practitioners experiencing thoughts of harming others, although he reported no intention of acting [on] these thoughts.""

Evidence concerning prospects of rehabilitation and likelihood of re-offending


	
	The first point to note in relation to the offender’s prospects of rehabilitation is that he is not at all remorseful. He continues to deny his guilt (and he is not to be punished for that). There is nothing to indicate that he has any empathy in relation to the death of Mr Huxley or for the plight of his family, colleagues and friends.
	
	
	Dr Nielssen found it impossible to provide any meaningful prediction about the question of future offending or rehabilitation. He noted that the offender was of normal intelligence and would appear to be capable of participating in counselling and other rehabilitation programs. There was no pattern of antisocial conduct prior to the offence and no history of alcohol or substance abuse. Dr Nielssen said the main area of concern that would warrant further attention in counselling before the offender’s eventual release was his reported account of having experienced fantasies of killing a stranger with a knife. Dr Nielssen considered that it would be expected that the offender complete the Violence Prevention Program, or that a similar program of intensive counselling should occur, before consideration of parole release.
	
	
	Dr Martin was also similarly guarded about making any prediction about future offending. One of his concerns was that he suspected that “there are many unknown issues which are yet to be disclosed around the offending” and that “it is impossible to know exactly how or why the murder occurred”. He did not think the issue of autistic tendencies adequately explained the violence, noting that the overwhelming majority of people with autism do not violently offend and then lie about their whereabouts to the police as the offender had done. Dr Martin wrote:
	


“In conclusion, my view is that, at this stage, it is not easy to understand the motivation for the murder of Mr Huxley. It is not clear to me, from a psychiatric perspective why or how the murder took place. He certainly presents as emotionally detached, and this makes it hard to know his true mindset, either at the time, or now.

At this stage what I think can be said is that the murder did not occur in the context of psychosis or major sustained mood disturbance. The violence did not appear to be driven by delusions, hallucinations, or disorganised behaviour suggestive of a mental illness such as schizophrenia. I do not think that psychiatric medication is likely to have been a material factor influencing the violent behaviour.”


	
	It was Dr Martin’s opinion that an assessment of future dangerousness could only be made on the basis of a “longitudinal assessment of the psychological issues”. He noted that there were limits on making such an assessment on the basis of a single interview and a review of various documents. He added:
	


“At this stage, it is not possible to offer the opinion that repeat offending will not occur, or that the risk can be reduced significantly with psychological treatment. Hopefully, in the future more information will be forthcoming such that issues such as motivation or other psychological factors might become more apparent and understandable.”


	
	Dr Pulman was even more pessimistic about the offender's prospects of further offending:
	


“Given Mr Kelsall is denying any responsibility for the murder for which he has been convicted and continues to maintain his innocence, the motivation for the offence is difficult to determine. Without any remorse and with the motive for the crime remaining unknown, it is likely that Mr Kelsall will require ongoing review during his period of incarceration. Through regular and close monitoring it is likely that a more defined diagnosis will emerge as to whether he has a mood disorder or an emerging mental illness such as schizophrenia or a personality disorder.

In the interim, the writer is unable to comment as to whether his risk of reoffending is likely to be reduced by psychological treatment and psychopharmotherapy. The assessment of future dangerousness will require longitudinal analysis of his behaviour and psychological condition. However, given he is young man of superior intelligence with a known history of deceit and emotional detachment, it is my opinion that he remains dangerous and accordingly the risk of future dangerousness remains high.”

Seriousness of the offence


	
	I have mentioned that the offender continues to deny his guilt. Accordingly, he has provided no explanation for doing what the jury were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt he did.
	
	
	One thing that is clearly established is that it was not an unprecedented thought to do what he did – he had thought of following someone home after work one night and killing them with a knife before - although the selection of Mr Huxley as a victim was probably quite random.
	
	
	I am not satisfied that the offender made the selection of Mr Huxley as a potential victim before or whilst he was in the hotel but I am satisfied that the thought occurred to him at least by the time Mr Huxley emerged from the hotel and the decision was taken to follow him.
	
	
	I am not satisfied that the offender had formed a firm intention to kill as he followed Mr Huxley to his home. He would have had no idea where Mr Huxley was going and whether there would be any opportunity to attack him. But I am satisfied that he followed him with a view to seeing what opportunity might arise.
	
	
	I am satisfied that the offender was armed with a knife. I reject as fanciful that the offender entered the deceased's unit unarmed, either in the hope of finding a weapon or just happening upon one by chance.
	
	
	I am satisfied that he entered the home for the sole purpose of killing Mr Huxley if he could. No other potential explanation presents as a reasonable possibility. I reject completely his account at trial that he was invited into the unit and then up to the bedroom in order to engage in consensual homosexual activity. The evidence is entirely contrary to the notion that Mr Huxley would have been at all interested in such activity. As to the indecent assault, this is something that was entirely opportunistic. I reject the suggestion that it played any part in the offender’s thinking when he entered the unit.
	
	
	The killing is rendered more serious by the fact that it was committed by an intruder into the victim's home and while the victim was incapacitated (by sleep, intoxication or both).
	
	
	This is a most chilling case of murder. Whether the offender killed ""for the thrill of it"", an expression he used when speaking to Dr Boulton the previous year, or as a result of a fantasy or obsession I am unable to say. What can be said is that it was utterly senseless and needless. And, despite the psychiatrists being unable to fathom a reason for it, it must have been the doing of a very disturbed individual. I am satisfied that the killing of Mr Huxley was done for no reason other than to serve some irrational purpose known only to the offender.
	


A life sentence?


	
	I have carefully considered the Crown’s submission that the murder of Mr Huxley is in the worst case category. Consideration of imposing a sentence of imprisonment for the term of the offender’s natural life arises if I am satisfied that the level of his culpability is so extreme that the community interest in the combined effect of the need for retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence can only be met through the imposition of such a sentence.
	
	
	I have been greatly assisted by the reminder of the case law relating to this issue in the submissions of senior counsel for the Crown. One observation that may be made is that the absence of clarity as to the offender’s motive is not a bar to finding that a case is in the worst case category; the very circumstances of the killing itself may be enough. And callousness and absence of remorse may be factors that tend in favour of imposition of a life sentence.
	
	
	Community protection and a concern about future dangerousness are problematic given the inability of the psychiatrists to express any firm view. But the Crown is right to point out that the law requires some assessment to be made where the evidence permits. In this case, the absence of a history of violence points in one direction whilst the circumstances of the crime itself point in the other. There is no conclusive psychiatric explanation for the offender's heinous conduct. There is no identifiable diagnosis of a psychiatric condition that is amenable to treatment.
	
	
	Unlike other findings I have made that are adverse to the offender, the need for protection of the community in the future is not a subject upon which a finding has to be made to the standard of beyond reasonable doubt. In my view, there is enough about the circumstances attending the killing of Mr Huxley, considered in the light of the thoughts the offender conveyed to doctors more than a year before, together with the assessment of the experts, particularly Dr Pulman, to give rise to very real concern. But it also has to be borne in mind that a sentence cannot be increased from what is proportionate to the gravity of the crime for this reason.
	
	
	I have earnestly considered the Crown's submissions about this case falling into the worst category, or that the community interest can only be served by the imposition of a life sentence. There are quite a number of features pointing in that direction. In the end, however, I do not see the case as being at that extreme.
	


Other matters relevant to the assessment of sentence


	
	The offender is young: 20 at the time of the killing and now 22. I do not get the sense that his crimes were in any way the product of immaturity. Nevertheless the fact is that he is not long into his adulthood and that must be taken into account as part of his overall subjective case.
	
	
	A particular matter in his favour is that he has no previous convictions and must be regarded as a person of otherwise good character.
	
	
	He is not remorseful and his prospects of rehabilitation are, at least, questionable.
	
	
	His mental health issues are not of such a type and significance, in my assessment, that call for any amelioration of sentence.
	
	
	The offender has been in custody since his arrest on 8 October 2013 and so his sentence will be backdated until then.
	
	
	I propose to impose a fixed term sentence in respect of the indecent assault offence. It is necessary to accumulate the sentence for the murder upon it by a slight degree (as submitted by the Crown and not opposed by the offender) so there would be no utility in setting a non-parole period.
	
	
	Mr Watson submitted that I should find that there are special circumstances warranting a reduction of the proportion of the sentence for the murder represented by the non-parole period. I have considered the matters he raised in support of the submission but have concluded that the parole period that will be allowed if the sentence is in the usual proportions will be sufficient. There is the additional consideration that it is necessary to set the non-parole period at a level that appropriately reflects all relevant matters, including the objective seriousness of the offence.
	


Family member victim impact statements


	
	Statements about the impact this terrible murder has had upon members of Mr Huxley's family were read by or on behalf of Allan, Deirdre, Tiffany and Oliver Huxley.
	
	
	The Crown has submitted that the harmful impact of Mr Huxley's death upon the members of his family should be taken into account as harm done to the community. There was no submission to the contrary.
	
	
	As I have observed in other cases, harm to the community is always caused when an innocent life is taken. The form in which the harm materialises may vary but all human life is recognised as equally precious. That is why the crime of murder is regarded as the most serious of criminal offences and attracts such an extreme maximum penalty and a substantial standard non-parole period.
	
	
	The harm in this case is demonstrated by what has been written by Mr Huxley's mother, father, sister and brother. I regret that I have not been able to find words capable of adequately describing the level of their grief, anguish and suffering. But they should be assured that they have my most sincere sympathy.
	


Sentence


	
	Convicted.
	


Indecent assault: sentenced to imprisonment for a period of 1 year with effect from 8 October 2013.

2703520,R v Seller; R v McCarthy [2015] NSWCCA 76,"HEADNOTE

[This headnote is not to be read as part of the judgment]

Following an audit by the Australian Taxation Office (ATO), the Australian Crime Commission (ACC) commenced an investigation into certain tax minimisation schemes promoted by the respondents, Mr Ross Edward Seller and Mr Patrick David McCarthy, from 1999-2003. During the course of the investigation, between May and September 2007, the ACC conducted compulsory examinations of each of the respondents on matters relevant to the offences for which they were ultimately charged, pursuant to the Australian Crime Commission Act 2002 (Cth) (the Act).

Mr Quincy Tang, an officer of the ATO who had been seconded to the ACC, was one of the principal investigators of the schemes. His role was to provide financial analysis for the ACC in respect of the investigation into the respondents. He was present on some occasions during the examinations of Mr Seller and Mr McCarthy.

At the outset of their examinations, both respondents claimed privilege against self-incrimination pursuant to s 30(4) of the Act. At the conclusion of Mr McCarthy’s examinations, directions were made, pursuant to s 25A of the Act, restricting distribution of the transcript to prosecution authorities. At the conclusion of Mr Seller’s examinations, directions were made permitting publication of the transcript to prosecution authorities on the condition that it not be stored electronically. Contrary to these directions, on 18 December 2007, the examination transcripts were disseminated to the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions (CDPP) and stored electronically. Subsequently, the respondents were charged with conspiracy to dishonestly influence the Commissioner of Taxation. The CDPP sought to allow Mr Tang to give evidence in the proceedings against the respondents.

At trial, both respondents sought orders: prohibiting Mr Tang from giving evidence; prohibiting any person who had read the compulsorily acquired material from giving evidence or being engaged by the CDPP; requiring the CDPP to identify all persons who had access to the compulsorily acquired material who it proposed to call as witnesses or who had assisted the CDPP. The respondents sought a temporary stay pending the appointment of a fresh prosecution team, arguing that Mr Tang may have played a role in the formulation of the charges against the respondents and the prosecution team may have unknowingly been provided with material derived from the examinations. The respondents also sought a permanent stay on grounds that the purpose of the examinations, to lock the respondents into a story, was unlawful and the accusatorial process had been fundamentally altered by the dissemination.

The CDPP argued that Mr Tang’s evidence would do no more than summarise accounts and other transactional documents obtained independently of the examination. Further, it argued that as the current prosecution team had expressly refrained from reading the compulsorily acquired material and had provided an assurance that they had not been provided with the material, they should not be prohibited from engagement in the proceedings.

The primary judge held that the fundamental right of the respondents to a fair trial called for the exclusion of Mr Tang’s evidence, the current prosecution team should not be removed and a permanent stay should not be granted.

The issues on appeal were: first, whether the Crown was competent to bring an appeal; second, whether the primary judge erred in prohibiting Mr Tang from giving evidence at trial; third, whether the primary judge erred in evaluating the evidence and failing to require the Crown to produce certain material; fourth, whether the primary judge erred in upholding the Crown’s claim for legal professional privilege in respect of certain documents; fifth, whether the primary judge erred in failing to grant a temporary or permanent stay.

The Court held (Bathurst CJ, Bellew J agreeing, Fullerton J writing separately), dismissing the appeal:

Issue 1: Competency

1.   Section 5F(2) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) permits the CDPP to appeal against an interlocutory order, subject to the limitation in s 5F(3A) that an appeal can only be brought against a decision on the admissibility of evidence if the decision eliminates or substantially weakens the prosecution’s case. Whether an order falls within this limitation is a question of substance not form: [78], [82] (Bathurst CJ); [228] (Fullerton J); [243] (Bellew J).

R v Cheikho [2008] NSWCCA 191; 75 NSWLR 323 applied.

2.   As a matter of substance, an order prohibiting a person from giving evidence goes beyond a ruling on admissibility. Thus, the order prohibiting Mr Tang from giving evidence was an interlocutory order and was not a ruling or decision on the admissibility of evidence. In these circumstances, the appeal was competent: [81]-[84] (Bathurst CJ); [228] (Fullerton J); [243] (Bellew J).

R v Cheikho [2008] NSWCCA 191; 75 NSWLR 323 applied.

Issue 2: The prohibition of Mr Tang from giving evidence

1.   The fundamental tenet of a fair trial is that it is for the prosecution to prove the guilt of an accused. Any risk of upsetting the balance between the power of the State and the accused, by the dissemination of compulsorily acquired material, is open to be remedied by discretionary orders prohibiting a witness who has had access to the compulsorily acquired material of an accused from giving evidence at the accused’s trial: [226] (Bathurst CJ); [230] (Fullerton J); [243] (Bellew J).

Lee v R [2014] HCA 20; 88 ALJR 65 applied.

2.   The fact that a proposed witness for the prosecution was present during the compulsory examination of an accused or had read the transcript of such an examination may not, in all cases, alter the trial in a fundamental respect. The question of whether such a witness must be excluded from giving evidence in the trial of the accused depends on the material the witness has been exposed to and the evidence the witness proposes to give, in the context of the issues in dispute at trial in an adversarial setting where the Crown has the obligation of proving the guilt of an accused. If in fact the evidence proposed to be given would alter the trial process in the fundamental sense described in X7 and Lee (2014), that witness may be prohibited from giving evidence at trial: [109]-[110] (Bathurst CJ); [229] (Fullerton J); [243] (Bellew J).

X7 v Australian Crime Commission [2013] HCA 29; 248 CLR 92; Lee v R [2014] HCA 20; 88 ALJR 65 considered.

3.   If Mr Tang were to adduce the evidence that he proposed to give, where he was privy to the examinations and compulsorily acquired material of the respondents, this would alter the accusatorial process inherent in a criminal trial in the fundamental sense described in X7 and Lee (2014). This conclusion was based on the findings that: Mr Tang’s evidence would be the vehicle through which a good deal of the prosecution’s documentary case would be led; he was assisted in his task by having access to the compulsorily acquired material; and the respondents entitlement to present or develop their defence through cross-examination of any Crown witness may have been hindered by the cross-examiner being forced to exercise constraint so that his or her questions did not trespass on compulsorily acquired information or risk the exposure of that material. This conclusion was reached notwithstanding that Mr Tang’s proposed evidence did not depend on, and was not substantially derived from, the compulsorily acquired material or that the CDPP was unaware of the material to which Mr Tang had access: [115]-[120], [122]-[123] (Bathurst CJ); [232]-[234] (Fullerton J); [243] (Bellew J).

X7 v Australian Crime Commission [2013] HCA 29; 248 CLR 92; Lee v R [2014] HCA 20; 88 ALJR 65 considered.

Issue 3: The evaluation of evidence and production of documents 

1.   For a trial to proceed, the Court must be satisfied that any dissemination of compulsorily acquired material to the prosecution would not result in the trial being unfair such that there is nothing the Court could to do relieve against the unfairness: [152] (Bathurst CJ); [235] (Fullerton J); [243] (Bellew J).

X7 v R [2014] NSWCCA 273 applied.

2.   In circumstances where the dissemination of compulsorily acquired material to prosecution authorities was disclosed, an assurance was accepted that no member of the current prosecution team had read the material and if there had been explicit reference to the material, it would have been disclosed, any prosecutorial duty to ensure that a case was presented properly and with fairness to the accused was satisfied. The prosecution was not obliged to produce any further material, it was necessary for the Court to decide whether a stay should be granted on the material available to it: [147], [151], [153]-[154] (Bathurst CJ); [235], [242] (Fullerton J); [243] (Bellew J).

Lee v R [2014] HCA 20; 88 ALJR 65 considered.

Spincode Pty Ltd v Look Software Pty Ltd [2001] VSCA 248; 4 VR 501 distinguished.

Issue 4: Legal professional privilege

3.   An imputed waiver of legal professional privilege will occur when conduct is inconsistent with the maintenance of the confidentiality the privilege is intended to protect. What brings about the waiver is the inconsistency, not some overriding principle of fairness operating at large. This is a question of fact and degree: [164] (Bathurst CJ); [239] (Fullerton J); [243] (Bellew J).

Mann v Carnell [1999] HCA 66; 201 CLR 1; Osland v Secretary Department of Justice [2008] HCA 37; 234 CLR 275 applied.

4.   No inference could be drawn against the Crown from the maintenance of the claim for privilege: [169] (Bathurst CJ); [239] (Fullerton J); [243] (Bellew J).

Wentworth v Lloyd (1864) 10 HLC 589; Giannarelli v Wraith (No 2) [1991] HCA 2; 171 CLR 592; Standard Chartered Bank of Australia Ltd v Antico (1993) 36 NSWLR 87 applied.

5.   In determining whether privilege had been waived, the Court should have focused on whether the maintenance of privilege was inconsistent with the Crown’s contention that the compulsorily acquired material did not give it any forensic advantage which deprived the respondents of a fair trial. However, having regard to the manner the Crown put its case, there was no unfairness in its maintenance of the privilege. The Crown’s denial of indirect disclosure to the prosecution team was not inconsistent with the maintenance of privilege: [161]-[162], [165] (Bathurst CJ); [235], [240] (Fullerton J); [243] (Bellew J).

6.   It would be inappropriate for a Court to stay proceedings until legal professional privilege properly claimed was waived. The principle in Lee (2014) did not extend to compelling waiver of privilege to enable the accused to embark on an inquiry as to whether there had been inadvertent disclosure of material. Legal professional privilege is an important common law right or immunity and Courts should not compel its waiver where it is legitimately claimed: [167]-[168] (Bathurst CJ); [235] (Fullerton J); [243] (Bellew J).

Lee v R [2014] HCA 20; 88 ALJR 65 considered.

Daniels Corporation International Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2002] HCA 49; 213 CLR 543 applied.

Issue 5: The grant of a permanent or temporary stay of proceedings

1.   Three matters should be considered when considering whether to grant a permanent stay. First, the power to grant a stay will rarely be exercised. Second, a stay will only be ordered where there is a fundamental defect of such a nature that there is nothing a judge can do to relieve against its unfair consequences. Third, irrespective of whether unfairness is demonstrated, a stay may be granted if the proceedings are an abuse of process, in the sense that the use of the proceedings brings the administration of justice into disrepute: [204] (Bathurst CJ); [235] (Fullerton J); [243] (Bellew J).

X7 v R [2014] NSWCCA 273 applied.

2.   The fact of an unauthorised examination or unlawful dissemination, on its own, does not necessitate a permanent stay. In this case, while the unlawful dissemination had the effect of prejudicing a fair trial, as a new prosecution team had been appointed and the only potential witness privy to the material had been excluded from giving evidence, the mere fact of dissemination to persons not involved in the trial did not alter the accusatorial process to such an extent as to warrant a stay: [203], [208]-[209] (Bathurst CJ); [235] (Fullerton J); [243] (Bellew J).

X7 v Australian Crime Commission [2013] HCA 29; 248 CLR 92; Lee v R [2014] HCA 20; 88 ALJR 65 considered.

3.   The fact that persons present during the compulsory examinations may have been party to the formulation of charges against the respondents did not warrant a stay. While there was a possibility that Mr Tang may have disclosed something based on the compulsorily acquired material, this possibility did not warrant a permanent or temporary stay or the prohibition of a prosecutor from continuing to act. This was particularly so given that the ACC Act did not prohibit communication between examiners and prosecutors: [215]-[219] (Bathurst CJ); [235] (Fullerton J); [243] (Bellew J).

4.   In this case, the ACC investigation was conducted for a proper purpose. Further, even if it was conducted in excess of, or was an abuse of, power, it would not follow that a stay should be granted as the proceedings did not depend on the contents of the examination and the compulsorily acquired material was not admissible in evidence or available to the prosecution team: [223]-[224] (Bathurst CJ); [235] (Fullerton J); [243] (Bellew J).

Judgment


	
	BATHURST CJ: Each of Ross Edward Seller (Mr Seller) and Patrick David McCarthy (Mr McCarthy) (the respondents) were charged on indictment that between about 24 May 2001 and about 30 December 2002 they conspired with each other and various other persons with the intention of dishonestly influencing a Commonwealth public official, the Commissioner of Taxation, in the exercise of his duties as a public official contrary to s 135.4(7) of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth). The indictment was presented on 14 March 2012, although the charges were initially brought on 22 September 2009.
	
	
	The conspiracy was said to arise in respect of an audit by the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) of certain tax minimisation schemes promoted by the respondents from 1999-2003. In the outline of the Crown case, contained in its submissions in response to the temporary stay application, the conspiracy has been summarised in the following terms:
	


“2.   Ross Edward Seller and Patrick David McCarthy together with Phillip Egglishaw and Philip de Figueiredo entered into an agreement to make false representations to officers of the ATO with the intention of dishonestly influencing them to approve and accept deductions claimed in the 1999, 2000 and 2001 income tax returns of taxpayers who had participated in whisky schemes in these years. The representations were to convey false and misleading information regarding:

(i) the association of the accused with and the relationship between the entities involved in the schemes;

(ii) Chambers Finance Limited and

(iii) Grant McKenzie Hong Kong Limited.”


	
	Following the audit, the Australian Crime Commission (the ACC) conducted an investigation into certain aspects of the schemes and the participation by the respondents in them. The examinations were conducted pursuant to Div 2 of Pt II of the Australian Crime Commission Act 2002 (Cth) (the Act).
	
	
	Mr McCarthy was examined by the ACC for four days from 14 May 2007 to 17 May 2007, on 30 July 2007 and on 12 and 13 September 2007. Mr Seller was summoned to be examined on 31 July 2007. The examination was adjourned without any questions being asked until 13 and 14 September 2007, when he was examined. The summons served on each of them required them to give evidence on matters relevant to the offences for which they were ultimately charged.
	
	
	In 2005, Mr Quincy Tang (Mr Tang), an officer of the Australian Tax Office (ATO), was seconded to the ACC. He was present on some occasions during the examinations of Mr McCarthy and Mr Seller and on other occasions observed the examinations from a separate room. His role was to provide financial analysis for the ACC in respect of the investigation into Mr McCarthy and Mr Seller. Mr Tang left the ACC and returned to the ATO in 2009.
	
	
	At the outset of his examination, Mr McCarthy claimed privilege against self-incrimination in the manner provided for in s 30(4) of the Act. At the conclusion of his examination, on 17 May 2007, the examiner gave a direction pursuant to s 25A(9) of the Act. That direction restricted distribution of the transcript of Mr McCarthy’s evidence and certain documents produced by him to a number of persons and bodies, including prosecution authorities. However, on the concluding day of his examination, 13 September 2007, a further direction was made permitting distribution only to certain members of staff of the ACC and to the ATO for the purpose of their functions arising from the investigation. In these circumstances, there was, at least from that time to 22 August 2008, no authority to distribute the transcript of Mr McCarthy’s evidence to the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions (CDPP).
	
	
	There had been no distribution of any part of the evidence given by Mr McCarthy prior to the direction given by the examiner at the conclusion of the examination on 13 September 2007. However, on 18 December 2007, material was provided by the ACC to the CDPP by way of a CD which included transcripts of the examinations of Mr McCarthy and Mr Seller. The distribution of Mr McCarthy’s evidence was contrary to the direction made by the examiner at the conclusion of the examination on 13 September 2007.
	
	
	On 22 August 2008, a delegate of the Chief Executive Officer of the ACC (CEO) varied the direction made by the examiner in relation to the evidence of Mr McCarthy. The variation permitted the distribution of the evidence given by him in May 2007 to, amongst others, prosecution authorities. The variation was made under the power conferred in s 25A(10) of the Act. The variation did not cover the evidence given by Mr McCarthy in July or September 2007.
	
	
	On 7 December 2009, the transcripts of the examinations of Mr McCarthy and Mr Seller were made available to the CDPP in MS Word form.
	
	
	On 6 March 2012, another delegate of the CEO made the final variation to the previous directions. This variation occurred after the arraignment of Mr McCarthy and, as stated above, after the information had been supplied to the CDPP. The varied direction allowed distribution to, amongst others, the prosecuting authorities and their lawyers for use in any criminal proceedings brought against Mr McCarthy. The varied direction stated that the restriction on the admissibility of the material in court proceedings contained in s 30(5) of the Act applied, but otherwise did not limit its use.
	
	
	Although the examination of Mr Seller was scheduled to commence on 31 July 2007, no evidence in fact was taken from him until 13 September 2007. Mr Seller claimed privilege against self-incrimination in the manner prescribed by s 30(4) of the Act. At the conclusion of the examination on 14 September 2007, the examiner made a direction under s 25A(9) of the Act that the evidence of Mr Seller and the documents produced by him not be distributed except to the CEO and staff of the examination. The direction provided that it may be varied by the CEO, but that such variation must not prejudice the safety or reputation of a person or the fair trial of a person who has been, or may be, charged with an offence. The direction was varied on 7 December 2007, to permit publication to:
	


“ ... any prosecution authority, the staff of such an authority, and counsel appointed by such an authority, to provide advice and in relation to the prosecution of offences for which they are responsible against Ross Seller, Patrick McCarthy, or Phillip Egglishaw.”


	
	The power relied on to make the variation on 7 December 2007 was a power conferred on the CEO by s 25A(10) of the Act. The authorisation to disseminate was on condition that the disseminated material be securely stored, not uploaded to any electronic storage system and not further published. Contrary to this direction, the CDPP stored the transcripts electronically on a computer drive within its system.
	
	
	As I indicated, the transcript of Mr Seller's evidence was provided to the CDPP on 18 December 2007. The decision to supply the information to the CDPP was made relying on the powers conferred on the CEO by s 59(7) of the Act. The record of the decision created by the ACC, and signed by the delegate of the CEO, stated that the delegate was satisfied that the information was relevant to the activities of the CDPP.
	
	
	On 17 August 2012, Garling J permanently stayed the proceedings on the indictment on the basis that the dissemination by the ACC to prosecutorial authorities of the transcripts of evidence given by the respondents at their compulsory examinations compromised their right to a fair trial.
	
	
	On 1 March 2013, this Court allowed an appeal from the order granting a permanent stay: R v Seller; R v McCarthy [2013] NSWCCA 42 (first appeal). The High Court refused special leave to appeal.
	
	
	It should be noted that, notwithstanding its conclusion that a stay should not be granted, the Court agreed with Garling J that as dissemination of material might prejudice a fair trial, the dissemination should not have taken place, particularly having regard to the provisions of s 25A(9) of the Act: first appeal at [108].
	
	
	The proceedings were assigned to Button J (the primary judge) who, as part of the pre-trial procedures, heard motions brought by the respondents. The motion filed on behalf of Mr Seller sought the following orders:
	


“(1)   An order that Quincy Tang be prohibited from giving evidence in these proceedings in accordance with his three statements dated 3 November 2009 and his statement dated 30 June 2010.

(2)   An order that all persons (including legal practitioners) who have read or listened to the Accusatorial Process Material or Indirect Accusatorial Process Material be prohibited from (a) giving evidence in these proceedings; (b) assisting the Commonwealth DPP in the preparation and conduct of these proceedings; (c) being retained or engaged by the Commonwealth DPP in the conduct of these proceedings.

(3)   The CDPP identify:

(a)   the name of all persons who have had access to the Accusatorial Process Material or Indirect Accusatorial Process Material whom the Crown proposes to call as witnesses or who have assisted;

(b)   in the preparation and conduct of these proceedings [sic];

(c)   what Accusatorial Process Material or Indirect Accusatorial Process Material those person(s) have had access to;

(d)   when those person(s) have had access to the Accusatorial Process Material or Indirect Accusatorial Process Material.

(4)   An Order that the ACC Accusatorial Process Material and Indirect Accusatorial Process Material be returned to the Australian Crime Commission.

…

(6)   An order temporarily staying these proceedings pending:

(a)   The CDPP’s compliance with paragraph 3 of this Notice of Motion;

(b)   The engagement of other counsel and CDPP personnel who have not read or listened to the Accusatorial Process Material or Indirect Accusatorial Process Material; and

(c)   The filing and serving of a Crown case statement (howsoever called) and particulars of the charge which have not been derived from Accusatorial Process Material or Indirect Accusatorial Process Material.

(7)   Such other orders as the Court deems fit.

(8)   Any proceedings on the indictment presented on 14 March 2012 against Ross Seller be stayed.”

Mr McCarthy filed a motion in the same terms.


	
	The expressions “Accusatorial Process Material” and “Indirect Accusatorial Process Material” were defined in the motions in the following terms:
	


“‘Accusatorial Process Material’ means transcripts, recordings or notes of any officer of the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions (CDPP), Australian Crime Commission (ACC) in respect of compulsory examinations of either accused at the ACC and documents and other materials compulsorily produced by either accused to the ACC.

‘Indirect Accusatorial Process Material’ means Material obtained indirectly by the ACC or the CDPP from use of the Accusatorial Process Material.”


	
	The primary judge made an order in terms of par 1 of the motions, but declined to make the other orders sought. The CDPP appealed against the order made by the primary judge pursuant to s 5F(2) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW). The respondents sought leave to appeal pursuant to s 5F(3) of that Act against the refusal by the primary judge to make the orders sought in pars 2, 3, 4, 6 and 8 in the notices of motion.
	


The relevant legislation


	
	To understand the judgment of the primary judge, the issues raised on the appeal and the submissions of the parties, it is necessary to have regard to those provisions of the Act which empower the ACC to conduct examinations and confer certain protections on examinees.
	
	
	Section 7A of the Act sets out the functions of the ACC. Of particular relevance for present purposes are s 7A(a), (b) and (c), which provide that the ACC has the following functions:
	


“7A(a)   to collect, correlate, analyse and disseminate criminal information and intelligence and to maintain a national database of that information and intelligence;

(b)   to undertake, when authorised by the Board, intelligence operations;

(c)   to investigate, when authorised by the Board, matters relating to federally relevant criminal activity.”


	
	Division 1A of Pt II of the Act deals with the performance of functions and exercise of powers by the ACC. Section 12(1) provides as follows:
	


“12(1)   Where the ACC, in carrying out an ACC operation/investigation, obtains evidence of an offence against a law of the Commonwealth or of a State or Territory, being evidence that would be admissible in a prosecution for the offence, the CEO must assemble the evidence and give it to:

(a)   the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth or the State, as the case requires; or

(b)   the relevant law enforcement agency; or

(c)   any person or authority (other than a law enforcement agency) who is authorised by or under a law of the Commonwealth or of the State or Territory to prosecute the offence.”


	
	Section 25A of the Act deals with the conduct of examination. Of particular relevance are s 25A(3), (9)-(11) which provide as follows:
	


“25A(3) An examination before an examiner must be held in private and the examiner may give directions as to the persons who may be present during the examination or a part of the examination.

...

(9)   An examiner may direct that:

(a)   any evidence given before the examiner; or

(b)   the contents of any document, or a description of any thing, produced to the examiner; or

(c)   any information that might enable a person who has given evidence before the examiner to be identified; or

(d)   the fact that any person has given or may be about to give evidence at an examination;

must not be published, or must not be published except in such manner, and to such persons, as the examiner specifies. The examiner must give such a direction if the failure to do so might prejudice the safety or reputation of a person or prejudice the fair trial of a person who has been, or may be, charged with an offence.

(10)   Subject to subsection (11), the CEO may, in writing, vary or revoke a direction under subsection (9).

(11)   The CEO must not vary or revoke a direction if to do so might prejudice the safety or reputation of a person or prejudice the fair trial of a person who has been or may be charged with an offence.”


	
	Section 30 of the Act deals with the obligation to answer questions asked by an examiner. So far as relevant, it provides as follows:
	


“30(2)   A person appearing as a witness at an examination before an examiner shall not:

(a)   when required pursuant to section 28 either to take an oath or make an affirmation - refuse or fail to comply with the requirement;

(b)   refuse or fail to answer a question that he or she is required to answer by the examiner; or

(c)   refuse or fail to produce a document or thing that he or she was required to produce by a summons under this Act served on him or her as prescribed.

...

(4)   Subsection (5) limits the use that can be made of any answers given at an examination before an examiner, or documents or things produced at an examination before an examiner. That subsection only applies if:

(a)   a person appearing as a witness at an examination before an examiner:

(i)   answers a question that he or she is required to answer by the examiner; or

(ii)   produces a document or thing that he or she was required to produce by a summons under this Act served on him or her as prescribed; and

(b)   in the case of the production of a document that is, or forms part of, a record of an existing or past business - the document sets out details of earnings received by the person in respect of his or her employment and does not set out any other information; and

(c)   before answering the question or producing the document or thing, the person claims that the answer, or the production of the document or thing, might tend to incriminate the person or make the person liable to a penalty.

(5)   The answer, or the document or thing, is not admissible in evidence against the person in:

(a)   a criminal proceeding; or

(b)   a proceeding for the imposition of a penalty;

other than:

(c)   confiscation proceedings; or

(d)   a proceeding in respect of:

(i)   in the case of an answer - the falsity of the answer; or

(ii)   in the case of the production of a document - the falsity of any statement contained in the document.”


	
	The effect of this section is that unlike its predecessor, s 30 of the National Crime Authority Act 1984 (Cth), it does not protect against derivative use of material obtained at the compulsory examination: first appeal at [14]-[17].
	


Factual background


	
	Each of the parties called in aid the background leading up to the examinations and certain of the events that occurred subsequently. The CDPP did so in order to show that the evidence to be called from Mr Tang at trial would do no more than summarise accounts and other transactional documents obtained independently of the examination, in circumstances where it would not otherwise be possible to conveniently examine the evidence (Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) s 50). The respondents did so to demonstrate why the orders sought in pars 2, 3, 4 and 6 of the motions were necessary in the administration of justice and to ensure a fair trial and why, notwithstanding the earlier decision of this Court, a permanent stay was justified.
	
	
	The tax minimisation schemes which formed the background of the conspiracy (the whisky schemes) may be summarised briefly. The whisky schemes involved investors entering into agreements by which whisky would be produced and sold on their behalf. The schemes involved the payment by investors of an upfront cash amount of 25% of their total investment, with the remaining 75% being financed by a corporation associated with the promoters of the schemes. The minimum total investment was $500,000, involving a minimum upfront cash payment of $125,000. Further investments in amounts of $500,000 could be made.
	
	
	To give effect to the schemes, the investors entered into a management agreement with the company Australian Spirit Management Pty Ltd (Australian Spirit). By that agreement, the investors agreed to pay Australian Spirit, the manager, what was described in the agreement as the “initial cost”, in consideration of Australian Spirit managing the project. The initial cost was defined as the total amount agreed to be invested by the investor concerned. In consideration of the initial cost, Australian Spirit agreed to pay for the cost of raw materials and to procure the distiller, Speyside Distiller Company Ltd (Speyside), to manage the distilled spirits and arrange for their storage and maintenance.
	
	
	The agreement provided for the distilled spirit (which when matured for three years became whisky) to be pooled and sold with the whisky produced for other investors. The proceeds were to be distributed to the investors in proportion to their investment.
	
	
	The initial cost was said to be payable on the date of execution of the agreement. The agreement provided that the investor would be deemed to have paid the initial cost if 25% of the initial cost (at least $125,000) was paid into a bank account nominated by Australian Spirit and a promissory note in respect of the balance, duly executed by the corporation Chambers Finance Ltd (Chambers), was provided by the investor to Australian Spirit.
	
	
	The Crown case to be brought at trial is in part based on the fact that Chambers, contrary to representations made by the respondents to officers of the ATO, was not a bona fide finance company and no monies were applied by it to the cost of the production of whisky.
	
	
	Australian Spirit entered into an agreement, described as a contractor agreement, with a British Virgin Islands company, Grant McKenzie Hong Kong Ltd (Grant McKenzie). Under the agreement, Grant McKenzie agreed to assume the obligations of Australian Spirit as manager under the management agreements and to enter into what was described as a co-venture agreement with Speyside. Australian Spirit agreed to pay the value of the initial cost payments, payable pursuant to each management agreement, to Grant McKenzie.
	
	
	The co-venture agreement between Grant McKenzie and Speyside was entered into. By that agreement, Speyside agreed to manufacture a nominated amount of the product on behalf of Australian Spirit and keep that product separate from other products manufactured by it. Grant McKenzie agreed to pay an amount described as the co-venture money, as well as money to be applied in manufacture of the product, its storage and insurance, into a bank account held by a firm Brechin Tindil Oatts in trust for the parties to the agreement.
	
	
	The loans made by Chambers to the investors were made pursuant to a letter agreement and a promissory note. The loans were to be secured by a mortgage granted by Australian Spirit or its delegate over the whisky produced by Speyside on behalf of the investors. The agreement provided that if Chambers elected to enforce its rights under the mortgage and sell the product, it would not be entitled to take personal action against the mortgagor, Australian Spirit.
	
	
	The lender, Chambers, issued a promissory note in favour of Grant McKenzie, promising to pay the portion of the initial cost to be borrowed by investors under the management agreements to Grant McKenzie on the 12th anniversary of the date of the note.
	
	
	The respondents referred to a number of matters which took place prior to the examination. They stated that the evidence established that in March 2005 the ACC commenced its investigation with the co-operation of the CDPP.
	
	
	Mr Tang was an officer of the ATO who was seconded to the investigation in June or July 2005. It was an agreed fact before the primary judge that Mr Tang was one of the principal investigators of the whisky schemes and that his role included investigating the conduct of the respondents. It was also agreed that he was largely responsible for the compilation of the financial material which underlay an understanding of the whisky schemes.
	
	
	In the period from 14 August 2006 to 17 November 2006, the ACC examined 11 witnesses in connection with the investigation into the whisky schemes. The purpose of the investigation programme appears to have been to conduct interviews with persons described in a case note of the ACC as “the outer circle”, before moving to what was described as “the inner circle”. The officer in charge of the investigation indicated in a case note of 23 November 2006 that she would prepare a briefing paper on the investigation and seek comment from the CDPP as to evidence that they require and draft charges that they would consider.
	
	
	Thereafter, from 19 December 2006 to 23 April 2007, a further 11 witnesses were examined.
	
	
	On 16 January 2007, Mr Tang prepared a document which, according to the respondents’ submissions, “recorded a sequence of events to assist in establishing a dishonest course of conduct by the accused”. The document set out a chronology of events and stated that this chronology assisted to establish a dishonest course of conduct by the respondents. It stated that the respondents knew that Chambers was not a bona fide arm’s length finance corporation and that they undertook to draft a series of documents to present to the ATO to show that it was. Its conclusion was in the following terms:
	


“14   The 4 July 2004 letter itself was provided by SELLER to the ATO as evidence that Chambers was a genuine arms length finance company, operating out of a London address. The very fact that SELLER and MCCARTHY drafted the letter and its contents assists in proving the opposite, that Chambers is NOT arms length and is NOT a bona fide finance institution.”

[Emphasis in original]


	
	Senior counsel for the respondents suggested, somewhat faintly, in submissions at the hearing, that the document may have been amended subsequent to the examination of Mr Seller and Mr McCarthy. That was not put to Mr Tang in evidence and there is no evidence to suggest that it was the case.
	
	
	Subsequently, on 13 April 2007, Mr Tang created a document referring to particular charges. It is not necessary to set these charges out, but it should be noted that the respondents submitted that when Mr Tang created the document, he was contemplating that the respondents could be charged with serious offences arising out of the whisky schemes. They submitted that part of his task in preparing the document was to consider various elements of the charges that it was necessary for the prosecutor to prove.
	
	
	Shortly prior to the examination of Mr McCarthy, Mr Tang prepared a series of what were described in the respondents’ submissions as cross-examination documents. Significantly, one document stated that Mr McCarthy and Mr Seller had fabricated five alternate versions of the whisky schemes and had been attempting to mislead and deceive the ATO. The document stated that each version could be shown to be a fabrication by documents held by the ACC. It also stated that the relevant facts showed that the 75% financing was a sham.
	
	
	Following the examination of Mr McCarthy in May 2007, Ms Elizabeth Simpkin (Ms Simpkin), the case officer of the ACC in charge of the investigation at that time, prepared a briefing paper which referred to the contents of Mr McCarthy’s examination and the matters on which he was to be further examined. The paper also suggested certain charges which could be laid. At the hearing, Mr Tang admitted that he “might have perused it”.
	
	
	The briefing paper was handed to Ms Julie Shouldice (Ms Shouldice), a lawyer employed by the DPP, at a meeting on 25 May 2007. The primary judge upheld a claim for privilege over the attendance note of Ms Shouldice.
	
	
	Mr Tang uplifted a CD containing a video or oral recording of Mr McCarthy’s compulsory examinations on 31 July 2007 and returned this on 7 August 2007. Mr Tang also prepared questions for the examination of Mr Seller. The questions that he prepared proposed putting documents to Mr Seller which were suggested to be inconsistent with his version of the schemes.
	
	
	A meeting was held between Ms Simpkin and Ms Shouldice on 22 August 2007. At the meeting, Ms Shouldice was informed of the status of the investigation and that a brief of evidence would be prepared. Privilege was claimed over the portion of Ms Shouldice’s notes that referred to the respondents and the whisky schemes.
	
	
	On 4 September 2007, Mr Tang uplifted a compact disc containing MYOB files, which Mr McCarthy had produced under s 28 of the Act. In a case note prepared on that day, Mr Tang stated that key documents had been identified and placed into the chronology spreadsheet that he had prepared. At the hearing, Mr Tang admitted that access to the MYOB files enabled him to track financial transactions far more efficiently and completely than by looking at the individual bank statements of a particular company.
	
	
	Mr Tang prepared cross-examination questions for the examinations of Mr McCarthy on 11 and 12 September 2007. Mr Tang attended at least part of these examinations and the compulsory examinations of Mr Seller.
	
	
	After reviewing the material, Mr Tang prepared a chronology, which he stated in his evidence he used to prepare his statement in the proceedings. He also stated that he may have provided it to the CDPP, but didn’t recall having done so.
	
	
	On 18 December 2007, the compulsory examination transcripts of the respondents were disseminated to the CDPP, marked for the attention of Ms Shouldice.
	
	
	It is unnecessary to deal in detail with the events which took place between then and January 2009, except to note that the CDPP personnel who were involved in that period were Ms Shouldice, Mr Berdj Tchakerian and, from August 2008, Mr Martin Corkery (Mr Corkery). Further, from time to time, Mr Tang accessed the transcripts and other compulsorily acquired material.
	
	
	On 5 February 2009, a meeting took place between Mr Tang, Ms Simpkin, the former case officers from the CDPP and the then current case officer, Mr Corkery. At the meeting, Mr Corkery requested certain additional work be undertaken.
	
	
	In the course of further preparation of the prosecution, meetings and discussions were held between ACC officers, particularly Ms Simpkin, and CDPP officers, including Mr Corkery and junior counsel which had by then been retained for the CDPP, Mr Paul McGuire (Mr McGuire). Mr McGuire continues to be retained as junior counsel for the CDPP. Also present at a number of the meetings was Ms Katrina Curry (Ms Curry) of the CDPP, who remains part of the prosecution team.
	
	
	The respondents placed particular reliance on three passages in the cross-examination of Mr Tang. These passages relate to material he accessed for the purpose of preparing his draft statements and the assistance he obtained from access to the transcripts of the examination. The first related to a service agreement produced by Mr McCarthy under s 28 of the Act, which Mr Tang indicated he regarded as a critical document. The cross-examination was as follows:
	


“Q. Well, when you were asked to draft your statements or perform the task you were asked on 17 March 2009, you did not have any belief, did you, whether it was appropriate or not to disclose to the Commonwealth DPP officers the content of what Mr McCarthy and Mr Seller said in their compulsory examinations, correct?

A. That is correct.

Q. Nor did you have any view whether it was appropriate or not to discuss the contents of documents produced under summons by Mr McCarthy and Mr Seller, correct?

A. Correct.

Q. You knew that this agreement that I have been asking about purported to formalise any arrangement between the parties, I put it that way, that existed since July 1999, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And you knew that if it were true, and accepting that if that were true, that would be a relevant matter in your investigation concerning the flow of funds to Eon, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. Well in those circumstances I would suggest that it would be, given the significance of that document which you admit, it is likely that you would have discussed its contents with Mr Corkery?

A. I do not ever recall discussing any of those matters with Mr Corkery.

Q. Accepting that we are now talking 2014, I am asking you to try and remember details of your discussions with a Commonwealth officer some five years earlier. Accepting that, what I am suggesting is you cannot rule out, can you, the reasonable possibility that you discussed this service agreement with Mr Corkery?

A. Yes, I would agree with that.”


	
	The second and third passages of the cross-examination related to the assistance he obtained from the transcript in preparing his draft statement:
	


“Q. … assuming that Mr McCarthy’s position were correct …?

A. (Witness nods).

Q. Would it be the case that the loans, in effect, would need to be actually repaid?

...

Q. That being so, if that were the case, that would undermine an allegation that the promissory notes were bogus or sham, wouldn’t they?

A. Yes.

Q. And, therefore, clearly his evidence about these promissory notes was highly relevant to your investigation?

A. Yes.”

“Q. Yes. That service agreement and what he has said about payment to Eon in the compulsory examination has informed you about what Mr McCarthy could say at the trial about those payments?

A. Yes.

Q. I want to suggest to you that it’s a reasonable possibility that the section 28 summons material, including the service agreement, including the MYOB files and the evidence that Mr McCarthy and Mr Seller gave in the compulsory examination, has assisted you in your knowledge of Mr McCarthy and Mr Seller’s involvement in the whisky schemes?

A. Yes.

Q. That material – I won’t repeat it all – but that material has assisted you in knowing about their explanation of how the schemes work?

A. Yes.

Q. That material has assisted you in particular knowing their explanation about the role promissory notes had to pay in the schemes?

A. Yes.

Q. That material assisted you in knowing their explanation of the status of various entities, including Grant McKenzie Hong Kong and Chambers Finance?

A. Yes.

Q. That material assisted you in knowing their explanation of their relationship between those various entities?

A. Yes.

Q. That material has assisted you in knowing the role of those entities in the whisky schemes ventures?

A. Yes.

Q. And that material has assisted you in knowing Mr McCarthy’s explanation of the reason why Eon received payments from Grant McKenzie Hong Kong?

A. Yes.”


	
	It is important to note that, as the primary judge stated, no members of the current Crown legal team received or otherwise had direct access to the compulsory acquisition material. Further, no person that had access to that material had, in conference, informed any of those lawyers of the contents in any explicit sense.
	


The reasoning of the primary judge


	
	The primary judge appeared to accept that particular aspects of the compulsorily acquired material did not specifically inform the statements of Mr Tang, noting that efforts to establish this “were not crowned with great success”: see R v Seller; R v McCarthy (No 3) [2014] NSWSC 1290 (primary judgment) at [31]. He also accepted that most of the evidence which was proposed to be given by Mr Tang was “mechanistic and not analytical”: primary judgment at [32].
	
	
	Despite these findings, the primary judge came to the conclusion that “Mr Tang’s understanding of the whisky schemes underpinning his proposed evidence was informed to a not insubstantial degree by his access to the compulsorily acquired material”: primary judgment at [34]. He stated that Mr Tang acknowledged as much. In that context, he relied on the cross-examination to which I have referred at [56] above, whilst noting that in re-examination, Mr Tang said that he did not depend on the material.
	
	
	The primary judge noted that although the whisky schemes were not the focus of the Crown case, they were an important part of it. He noted that Mr Tang was present during much of the compulsory examinations, which the primary judge described as lengthy, probing and detailed. He also noted that Mr Tang had repeatedly accessed the compulsorily acquired materials. He stated that he was satisfied that a substantial portion of that access was to analyse the whisky schemes and the respondents’ role in them. He stated that Mr Tang’s work extended to collating and analysing the compulsorily acquired material.
	
	
	The primary judge also concluded that the compulsorily acquired MYOB files played a role in enhancing Mr Tang’s understanding of the whisky schemes (that went beyond the negligible).
	
	
	The primary judge ultimately concluded that although Mr Tang had a very good understanding of the schemes separate from the compulsorily acquired material, his understanding of them had been substantially enhanced by that material. He accepted that in those circumstances, it would be difficult to cross-examine Mr Tang about his analysis without the jury being made aware of that material.
	
	
	The primary judge stated that the principle which underlay cases such as X7 v Australian Crime Commission [2013] HCA 29; 248 CLR 92 (X7), Lee v New South Wales Crime Commission [2013] HCA 39; 251 CLR 196 (Lee (2013)) and Lee v R [2014] HCA 20; 88 ALJR 65 (Lee (2014)), was that a criminal trial was accusatorial and the Crown bears the onus of proving its case beyond reasonable doubt without compelled assistance from the accused.
	
	
	The primary judge noted that the respondents had not been charged at the time they were compelled to give evidence and produce documents. However, referring to Lee (2014) at [2] and [6], he pointed out that issues to do with whether compulsory processes have infected, or could infect, the fairness of a criminal trial are not to be determined by reference to a bright line test of whether, at the time of the compulsory process, the accused had or had not been charged with an offence.
	
	
	The primary judge also rejected the proposition that there was a simple bright line between the provision of such material to prosecuting lawyers and provision to important prosecution witnesses. He referred in particular to what I said in my judgment in the first appeal at [115].
	
	
	The primary judge concluded that, in these circumstances, the fundamental right of the respondents to a fair trial according to law, in which it was incumbent on the Crown to prove its case unassisted by compelled evidence of the accused, called for the exclusion of the evidence of Mr Tang. He said that if Mr Tang was called, he would regard that as creating an unfair trial that should be stayed. Alternatively, if a stay was not available as a remedy, he stated that he would exercise his discretion to exclude the evidence under s 138 of the Evidence Act.
	
	
	In regard to the second order sought in the accused’s notices of motion, the primary judge accepted that there were circumstances where persons would be prevented from prosecuting a case where they had access to compulsorily acquired material. However, he stated that it was another matter to assert that lawyers who have expressly refrained from reading that material and whose assurance that they have not been provided with the material in conference or otherwise has been accepted, must nevertheless be prohibited from further engagement in the matter.
	
	
	The primary judge said that even accepting that the current prosecuting team may have been “unknowingly, unconsciously, indirectly and amorphously provided with some opinion or analysis ultimately derived from the compulsorily acquired material”, neither Lee (2014), nor any other decision, required a finding that it was necessary to engage a prosecution team who have not had contact with any witness who may have seen the material. The primary judge made the following remarks:
	


“[72]   On that basis, it was said that a fresh prosecution solicitor must be instructed and fresh counsel briefed, and that all of the functions already performed, such as formulation of an indictment, the identification of particulars of the counts, and preparation and provision of a Crown case statement, must be set at nought and begun afresh.

[73]   I respectfully reject that proposition of the two accused. It is one thing to say that there is a direct use immunity in the ACC Act; that, although there is no explicit derivative use immunity in that statute, there will be circumstances (such as I have found to exist here) where evidence that is derived from compulsorily acquired material must not be part of the prosecution case; that prosecuting legal teams must not have access to compulsorily acquired material with the express intention and result of informing themselves about possible defences and other forensically highly useful matters (as occurred in Lee v The Queen [2014]: see [15]); and that, if the latter occurs, then those lawyers should not prosecute the matter further. But it is quite another matter to assert that lawyers who have expressly refrained from reading the compulsorily acquired material, and whose assurance that they have not been provided with that material in conference or otherwise has been accepted, must nevertheless be prohibited from appearing further in the matter.

[74]   The contention of the two accused is that the current prosecution team may have been unknowingly, unconsciously, indirectly and amorphously provided with some opinion or analysis ultimately derived from the compulsorily acquired material. …

[75]   Even accepting, for the sake of argument only, the proposition that that may have occurred, I do not consider that the judgment in Lee v The Queen [2014], or any other judgment to which I was invited, calls for the relief sought. To my mind, that would constitute a very large extension of the principles discussed in Lee v The Queen [2014], including at [44]. And I consider persuasive the submission of the Crown that, if this contention of the two accused were correct, then the High Court in Lee v The Queen [2014] would have spoken not only of the necessity of a new team of prosecuting lawyers, but also of the necessity of a new team that was to have nothing to do with any witness, or investigator, or other person who may have read the compulsorily acquired material, or some report or analysis based upon it.”


	
	The primary judge rejected the submission that the fact that Mr Tang and Ms Simpkin may have played some role in the formulation of the charge in the Local Court meant that a fresh prosecution team was required. In doing so, the primary judge pointed out that after committal proceedings, the Crown Prosecutor exercises an independent judgment with respect to the filing of a bill of indictment and its particularisation.
	
	
	In these circumstances, the primary judge did not deal with the orders sought in pars 3, 4 and 6 in the notices of motion.
	
	
	So far as the application for a permanent stay was concerned, the primary judge noted that the application was based on the proposition that Ms Simpkin had stated in August 2007 that the investigation stage had ended and that the purpose of the further examinations was to lock the respondents into a story and that, in those circumstances, the examination was unlawful.
	
	
	His Honour rejected that submission. He stated that it was not significant that an officer of the ACC at one stage expressed the opinion that the investigating stage had ended. He pointed out that as a matter of fact it had not, noting that subsequent to that date Ms Simpkin travelled to Hong Kong as part of the investigation. He also stated that because of the operation of the Act, none of the answers given by Mr McCarthy in the compulsory examination would be available at trial, nor, having regard to his conclusion on the order sought in par 1, would the evidence of Mr Tang.
	
	
	The primary judge also rejected the submission that a stay should be granted by reason of the fact that the accusatorial process had been fundamentally altered by the mere giving of answers to questions at the compulsory hearing. He pointed out that in Lee (2014), the High Court did not grant a permanent stay but ordered a new trial. He also stated that in X7, the order made was a prohibition on the continuation of the compulsory examination, not a permanent stay. The latter statement is incorrect. The Court in X7 was tasked with answering a question in a stated case, namely, whether Div 2 of Pt II of the Act authorised the compulsory examination of a person charged with an offence about matters the subject of the charged offence. The question was answered in the negative.
	


The Crown appeal


	
	As I indicated, the Crown appealed against the order made by the primary judge that Mr Tang be prohibited from giving evidence at the trial. It is convenient to deal with that matter first, although the submissions to some extent overlap with the submissions on the respondents’ appeal. In this context, a preliminary issue arose as to whether the appeal could be brought under s 5F(2) of the Criminal Appeal Act (the competency issue).
	


The parties’ submissions on the competency issue


	
	The Crown submitted that the appeal was one which could be brought under s 5F(2) of the Criminal Appeal Act. It was submitted that the order made by the primary judge was not merely a ruling on the admissibility of evidence but rather an order relating to the status of a witness. The Crown pointed out that the order would not impede another person who had examined the business records referred to by Mr Tang in his statement from giving identical evidence. The Crown pointed out that the orders made by the primary judge involved the determination of what was required to ensure a fair trial.
	
	
	The Crown pointed out that unlike mere rulings on evidence, the order was not capable of reversal at the trial and, unlike rulings on evidence, was capable of being entered in the records of the court. Referring to R v Cheikho [2008] NSWCCA 191; 75 NSWLR 323 (Cheikho), it was submitted that an interlocutory decision on a question of law regarding whether evidence should be admitted may constitute an interlocutory judgment for the purpose of s 5F(2) of the Criminal Appeal Act. The respondents submitted that the appeal was not competent as it involved a ruling on the admissibility of evidence, which is not an interlocutory judgment or order within the meaning of s 5F(2).
	
	
	Senior counsel for the respondents submitted that Cheikho could be distinguished as it was concerned with a constitutional question, namely, the validity of s 18(2) of the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979 (Cth). He submitted that in the present case, the order in form and in substance was that Mr Tang’s evidence, in totality, could not be admitted and that was a ruling on the admissibility of evidence.
	


Consideration


	
	Relevantly, s 5F(2) of the Criminal Appeal Act permits the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) to appeal against an interlocutory order in proceedings to which the section applies. It was not disputed that the section extends to the CDPP. The DPP’s ability to appeal is subject to the limitation contained in s 5F(3A) of that Act, that the Crown or DPP may only appeal against a decision or ruling on the admissibility of evidence if the decision eliminates or substantially weakens the prosecution’s case. The Crown did not contend that if the decision was a ruling on the admissibility of evidence, it could rely on s 5F(3A) to ground the appeal.
	
	
	The order sought to be appealed from in the present case is in the following terms:
	


“Quincy Tang is prohibited from giving evidence in the trial in accordance with his three statements dated 3 November 2009 and his statement dated 30 June 2010.”


	
	As expressed, the order is not a ruling or decision on the admissibility of evidence. Rather, it prohibits Mr Tang from giving evidence on the subject of his statements altogether, whether or not it would be admissible or otherwise. It should be noted that there was no contention that the primary judge lacked the power to make such an order and could only have dealt with the matter by excluding the evidence under s 138 of the Evidence Act.
	
	
	Further, on its face, the order is an interlocutory order. It was not contended that it was one which could not be entered on the Court’s records.
	
	
	This is not to dispute the well-established principle set out in cases such as R v Edelsten (1989) 18 NSWLR 213 and R v Steffan (1993) 30 NSWLR 633 (Steffan), that a ruling on the admissibility of evidence, whether or not made in advance of the trial, is not an interlocutory judgment or order for the purpose of s 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act. However, as Spigelman CJ pointed out in Cheikho at [25], whether or not an order falls within this prohibition is a question of substance not form. As a matter of substance, an order prohibiting a person from giving evidence goes beyond a ruling on admissibility.
	
	
	Further, the rationale in Steffan for the decision that a ruling on the admissibility of evidence is not an interlocutory order for the purpose of s 5F, namely, that such a ruling cannot be entered on the Court’s record and does not command that anything be done or not done (at 639), has no application in the present case. It was not contested that the order could be entered on the Court’s record or that the prohibition of Mr Tang giving evidence was a command that something not be done.
	
	
	In these circumstances, in my opinion, the appeal is competent.
	


The grounds of appeal


	
	The Crown relied on the following grounds of appeal:
	


“1. The learned trial judge erred in finding that Mr Tang’s understanding of the whisky schemes, underpinning the evidence of funds flows which the Crown proposes to lead from him, was:

1.1 informed to a not insubstantial degree by his access to compulsorily acquired material [34], [49], [63] and

1.2 enhanced to more than a negligible extent by consideration of compulsorily acquired MYOB files [46].

2. The learned trial judge erred in finding that Mr Tang’s evidence was:

2.1 relevantly more than an analysis of financial records [48] and

2.2 expert opinion evidence that had been substantially derived from compelled self-incrimination [63].

3. His Honour ought to have found that:

3.1 an understanding of the commercial and financial relationships which constituted each of the whisky schemes was readily available to Mr Tang (and was in fact acquired by him) prior to any process of compulsory examination or production of documents, from the terms of contracts which formed elements in the schemes, from information memoranda about the schemes and like material provided to him by Australian Taxation Office personnel;

3.2 the evidence proposed to be led by the Crown from Mr Tang was in substance no more than the collation and summation of numerous individual funds transfers evidenced in business records identified by the witness;

3.3 the said business records identified by Mr Tang as the primary materials from which he has derived the individual funds transfers the subject of his collation and summation do not include any documents compulsorily acquired from the Accused;

3.4 in the above circumstances, the evidence proposed to be led from Mr Tang is in substance evidence as to the accuracy of his summations, relative to the identified business records from which his figures have been derived, and that evidence is incapable of having been significantly contributed to by any answers given by the Accused under compulsory examination (which are not nominated as source data for the funds transfers summarised), or by documents compulsorily obtained (which also are not nominated by Mr Tang as sources).

4. The learned Trial Judge erred in finding that:

4.1 it would be extremely difficult for the Accused’s counsel to cross-examine Mr Tang about his financial analysis without the jury becoming aware of inadmissible compulsorily acquired material [23], [24], [49] and

4.2 it will be impossible to disentangle the bases of Mr Tang’s understanding and analysis of the whisky schemes [49].

5. His Honour ought to have held that:

5.1 Mr Tang’s understanding of the whisky schemes (as opposed to the facts of the schemes in the sense of the commercial and financial relationships and transactions which actually constituted them) would be an irrelevant subject at the trial;

5.2 the bases of Mr Tang’s understanding of the whisky schemes would equally be an irrelevant subject at the trial;

5.2 the analysis of the funds flows which occurred pursuant to the said commercial and financial relationships, as proposed to be adduced by the Crown from Mr Tang, will be expressly based upon the business records of individual transactions which he had collated and added and no question of disentangling will arise and

5.3 it will be within the control of counsel to formulate questions in cross-examination in such a manner as not to call for answers which would disclose compulsorily acquired and inadmissible material.

6. His Honour erred in holding that principles stated in Lee v The Queen [2014] HCA 20 required that, on the basis Mr Tang had become privy to information compulsorily acquired from the Accused by the Australian Crime Commission, he should be excluded from giving evidence notwithstanding that such evidence as the Crown would adduce from him would not disclose the compulsorily acquired information [55].

7. His Honour ought to have held that:

7.1 the evidence proposed to be led from Mr Tang had not relevantly been informed by and was not derived from compulsorily acquired information but would be evidence of the character referred to in Ground 3 and

7.2 even if Mr Tang’s proposed evidence was in some manner derived from compulsorily acquired information to which he had become privy, that would not render the evidence inadmissible or improperly obtained in circumstances where the evidence to be given would not disclose or include the compulsorily acquired information.

8. His Honour erred in concluding that Mr Tang’s evidence was improperly obtained [62].”


	
	Because of the overlapping nature of the submissions on these grounds, it is convenient to deal with them together.
	


The parties’ submissions

A The Crown


	
	The Crown pointed out that what it was seeking to establish at the trial was first, what contractual, commercial and financial arrangements constituted the whisky schemes, and second, the flow of funds between parties to the schemes and the purpose of the flow of funds.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the identities of the relevant parties and the commercial and financial arrangements between them could be readily ascertained. It was pointed out that Mr Tang’s evidence was that he had ascertained the relevant relationships by April 2005.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the evidence to be given by Mr Tang was evidence that he had examined a large number of primary business records of individual fund movements in various accounts and evidence identifying the total amounts which he had calculated as having passed between particular parties to the schemes. It was submitted that this was no more than evidence of a summary in accordance with s 50 of the Evidence Act.
	
	
	The Crown pointed to the analysis carried out by Mr Tang, to which I have referred at [40] above, and the fact that he prepared notes for the cross-examination of the respondents, as demonstrating that he well understood the commercial and financial relationships in each of the schemes prior to the compulsory examination.
	
	
	In these circumstances, the Crown submitted that the primary judge was in error in concluding that Mr Tang’s understanding of the whisky schemes was informed to a not insubstantial degree by his access to the compulsorily acquired material. It was submitted that, in any event, the schemes would be proved through the scheme documents and that the flow of funds analysis conducted by Mr Tang was no more than a mathematical calculation which was either correct or incorrect.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that, having regard to the nature of the evidence given by Mr Tang, there would be no need for defence counsel to ask him anything concerning the compulsory examinations. It was submitted that the position was no different from that of defence counsel examining police officers where a record of interview has been excluded.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the exclusion Mr Tang’s evidence was a significant extension of the principle in Lee (2014). It was submitted that witnesses were in an entirely different position to prosecutors and it could not be said that a mere witness having knowledge of compulsorily acquired material would give the Crown any advantage whatsoever.
	
	
	Senior counsel for the Crown submitted that the draft statements of Mr Tang showed that his analysis was based on material other than that compulsorily acquired. It was submitted that notwithstanding what was said by Mr Tang in his statement of 3 November 2009 that he followed generally accepted accounting principles, his statements did not involve the application of accounting expertise.
	
	
	Senior counsel for the Crown stressed in particular that prosecutors are in a different position to witnesses as witnesses are not called upon to decide how charges are to be particularised, what evidence to gather and what cross-examination is to take place.
	
	
	So far as the respondents relied upon Mr Tang’s access to the service agreement produced by Mr McCarthy under s 28 of the Act to support their submissions, the Crown pointed out that what was relevant was the flow of funds to Eon 2000 Pty Ltd and Sinadu Pty Ltd. It was submitted that that could be proved from the bank statements and that ASIC searches showed that these companies were associated with the respondents.
	
	
	Senior counsel for the Crown emphasised that it was no part of the Crown case to have Mr Tang give evidence that the transactions were bogus or shams, nor was it relevant to establish whether or not the promissory notes would ever have been called upon. He emphasised that the relevant question was whether the answers given by the respondents to the two auditors were correct. He stated that in any event, questions relating to the future drawing on the promissory notes, described as back end transactions, could be asked of other persons to be called including Mr Walsh the auditor and Mr Moloney, an Assistant Commissioner involved in the audit.
	


B The respondents


	
	The respondents submitted that it was open to the primary judge to find that Mr Tang’s understanding of the schemes was substantially enhanced by the compulsorily acquired material. They submitted that it would be difficult to cross-examine Mr Tang without the jury becoming aware of that material, as it would be impossible to disentangle the bases of his understanding.
	
	
	The respondents submitted that Mr Tang’s statements were not mere mathematical exercises. Rather, his evidence involved addressing particular issues and giving opinions concerning classification of records, matching and filling in gaps, such as counterparties and the purpose of transactions. They pointed to the focus by Mr Tang on the service agreement and the promissory notes and the fact that he had drawn conclusions regarding the role of the promissory notes, which was the subject of the compulsory examination.
	
	
	The respondents referred particularly to the service agreement (which they acknowledged trial counsel for the Crown had not seen) which Mr Tang said he regarded as a critical document and his evidence that there was a reasonable probability that he had discussed it with Mr Corkery of the CDPP and a reasonable possibility that it assisted him in the drafting of his statement. They referred to Mr Tang’s statement that he regarded the agreement as significant because it related to secret fees and commissions.
	
	
	The respondents also referred to what was said by Mr Tang in his statement of 3 November 2009, at [202], that the promissory notes did not reconcile with the source documents and that the promissory note funds were not used for the purchase or manufacture of whisky. The respondents referred to the evidence of Mr Tang that the scheme could have operated without the promissory notes, which the respondents noted was consistent with Mr Tang’s opinion of them as bogus or a sham. The respondents stated that these matters were the subject of the compulsory examination.
	
	
	The respondents also referred to the affidavit of Mr Tang in these proceedings in which he stated that the examination of Mr McCarthy provided additional knowledge of transactions in the whisky schemes which were contemplated and yet to take place. Mr Tang did state however that these back end transactions were not relevant to the investigation.
	
	
	The respondents submitted that it was immaterial that Mr Tang had significant knowledge of the schemes prior to the compulsory examination, stating that it was unfair that his understanding was improved or assisted by the compulsorily acquired material.
	
	
	Senior counsel for Mr McCarthy (whose submissions were adopted without elaboration by counsel for Mr Seller) submitted that it was not necessary to demonstrate prejudice. Rather, all that needed to be demonstrated was that Mr Tang was aware of the compulsorily acquired material.
	
	
	Senior counsel for Mr McCarthy submitted that it would be almost impossible for the Court to anticipate all possible scenarios that might eventuate were Mr Tang to give evidence. He submitted, by way of example, that if Mr Tang was cross-examined on his opinion that the payments to Eon 2000 Pty Ltd and Sinadu Pty Ltd were payment of fees to the respondents, he would be drawing on his knowledge of the service agreement, which he described as a highly relevant matter. He acknowledged that that may not be a matter on which Mr Tang would be questioned by the Crown.
	


Consideration


	
	As I indicated, it was not contended that the primary judge had no power to make the order the subject of the appeal. Rather, it was contended that he erred as a matter of discretion in doing so.
	
	
	The Crown appeal deals with a situation where a witness to proceedings was privy to the compulsory examination of a person subsequently charged, or had received and read the transcript of his compulsorily acquired evidence. The question which arises is whether such a witness should be prohibited from giving evidence because the availability of the compulsorily acquired evidence to the witness deprives the accused of a trial according to law. This question will be answered by reference to the fundamental elements of a trial according to law: see X7 at [89]-[93]; Lee (2014) at [31]-[32], [40]-[41]. Lee (2014) concluded that that was the effect of supplying such compulsorily acquired material to prosecuting authorities. It did not deal with the supply of such material to witnesses.
	
	
	It should be noted that unlike X7, the examination in the present case was not illegal. Further, the dissemination of the material to Mr Tang did not contravene the direction given under s 25A(9) of the Act at the conclusion of the examinations, as at the relevant time, Mr Tang was an officer of the ACC.
	
	
	However, these matters are not conclusive. If in fact the giving of evidence by Mr Tang would alter the trial process in a fundamental respect, in the sense described in X7 and Lee (2014), then the primary judge was correct in ordering that Mr Tang be prohibited from giving evidence at trial. The following remarks of the Court in Lee (2014) at [46] are apposite:
	


“[46]   In X7, it was held that the compulsory examination of a person with respect to an offence with which the person stands charged would be a departure, in a fundamental respect, from that principle. X7 was ultimately concerned with questions of statutory construction. Nevertheless, the point it makes about what may amount to a fundamental departure from a criminal trial as it is comprehended by our system of criminal justice is relevant to this case. It is a breach of the principle of the common law, and a departure in a fundamental respect from a criminal trial which the system of criminal justice requires an accused person to have, for the prosecution to be armed with the evidence of an accused person obtained under compulsion concerning matters the subject of the charges. It cannot be said that the appellants had a trial for which our system of criminal justice provides and which s 13(9) of the NSWCC Act sought to protect. Rather, their trial was one where the balance of power shifted to the prosecution.”

[Internal citations omitted]

See also the emphasis by French CJ and Crennan J in X7 (in dissent on the question of construction) on the importance of the protective provisions in s 25A(9) of the Act: at [25]-[27].


	
	I do not think that the fact that any potential witness was present during the compulsory examination of a person subsequently charged or who had read the transcript of evidence given at the compulsory examination, in all cases, would alter a trial in a fundamental respect in the sense described in X7 and Lee (2014). However, it is unnecessary to decide that point.
	
	
	I have reviewed the statements of evidence that it is proposed that Mr Tang lead at the trial. That review confirms the position I expressed in the first appeal (at [115]) that his evidence is an analysis by an accountant of the financial consequences of certain transactions outlined in documents considered by him. However, that is not to say that it does not involve the application of accounting expertise. Further, the statements do draw conclusions from the examination of the documents.
	
	
	Thus, in his first statement, Mr Tang concluded that funds drawn down from Chambers were not paid to Scottish Distillers for the manufacture of whiskey (first statement at [14], [202]). He stated that in carrying out his reconciliation, he adopted a matching principle indicating that where it was reasonable to do so he matched expenses with debits or credits (first statement at [17]).
	
	
	In his second statement, he concluded that the proceeds of the Chambers’ promissory notes were not paid for the purchase or manufacture of whiskey (second statement at [14], [269]). He also concluded that Chambers’ invoices were not bona fide source documents (second statement at [155]). He stated that in carrying out his work, he applied the accounting principle of materiality (second statement at [19]).
	
	
	In his third statement, he concluded that an amount of $628,000, paid to Sinadu Pty Ltd, was paid to an entity associated with Mr Sellers and was not evidenced by source documents (third statement at [142]).
	
	
	Importantly, Mr Tang’s statements indicate that his evidence will be the vehicle through which a good deal of the prosecution’s documentary case will be led and explained. If it was open to the primary judge to conclude that he was assisted in this task by having the examination transcripts and the compulsorily acquired material in his possession, then it was in my opinion open to the judge to conclude that his giving evidence would alter the accusatorial process in the sense described in X7 and Lee (2014).
	
	
	Mr Tang acknowledged that Mr McCarthy’s evidence about the promissory notes was highly relevant to his investigation and the material produced by the respondents under summons issued pursuant to s 128 of the Act, particularly the MYOB files, had assisted him in ascertaining how the whiskey schemes operated and the role of the promissory notes in them (see [56] above).
	
	
	In these circumstances, it does not seem to me that the primary judge erred in concluding that Mr Tang’s understanding of the schemes was informed “to a not insubstantial degree” by his access to compulsorily acquired material or that his understanding was enhanced, to more than a negligible degree, by consideration of the compulsorily acquired MYOB files.
	
	
	Further, having regard to the conclusions reached by Mr Tang in his statements to which I have referred above, it does not seem to me that the primary judge erred in concluding that Mr Tang’s evidence was more than merely an analysis of financial records.
	
	
	I accept, as Mr Tang pointed out in re-examination, that the evidence he proposes to give does not depend on the transcripts or the compulsorily acquired material.
	
	
	Further, it is apparent from the document prepared by Mr Tang on 16 January 2007 and the work done by him leading up to the examination of Mr McCarthy that he had a significant knowledge of the whiskey schemes prior to the examination. While on the material available I would not agree with the primary judge that his evidence was substantially derived from compulsorily acquired material, the fact remains, as Mr Tang acknowledged, that he was assisted in his investigation by it. It follows, in my opinion, that the material assisted him in the preparation of his statement.
	
	
	I acknowledge, as the Crown pointed out, that the charges do not relate to the whiskey schemes themselves, nor to any tax avoidance which resulted from them. However, as the primary judge said, the conspiracy the subject of the indictment is to defraud the Commonwealth by misleading it about salient aspects of the schemes by making misrepresentations to officers of the ATO. The outline of the Crown case states that the representations were to convey false and misleading information concerning first, the association of the respondents with, and the relationship of entities involved in, the schemes and second, Chambers and Grant McKenzie. In these circumstances, the schemes themselves and the flow of funds which occurred provide the background against which the jury will assess the truth or falsity of the representations.
	
	
	Further, it cannot be stated with any certainty that the respondents will not be hindered in challenging any aspect of the Crown case in cross-examination of Mr Tang. Although it is correct that the evidence of Mr Tang is largely a review and reconciliation of documentary records, it does not follow that the cross-examination will necessarily be limited to challenging Mr Tang’s calculations and reconciliation. The course of cross-examination cannot be predicted with certainty. In these circumstances, the possibility that the respondents will be limited or hindered in their cross-examination of Mr Tang by the evidence given at the compulsory examinations cannot be excluded. The possibility that such questions may be asked of other witnesses, as the Crown suggested, does not seem to me to be an answer to this difficulty.
	
	
	In these circumstances, if Mr Tang were to adduce the evidence which he proposed to give, in circumstances where he was present at the compulsory examination and reviewed the transcript and other compulsorily acquired material, this would alter the accusatorial process inherent in a criminal trial in the fundamental sense described in X7 and Lee (2014).
	
	
	Thus, the Crown appeal should be dismissed.
	


The respondents’ appeal


	
	The respondents relied on the following grounds of appeal. For ease of reference, I have inserted under each relevant ground the particular paragraphs of the respondents’ notices of motion to which the ground relates:
	


“Paragraphs 2, 3, and 6 of the notice of motion.

1. His Honour erred in that he failed to find that the Crown (a) bore a duty as prosecutor and/or (b) bore an evidential onus, to satisfy the court that material compulsorily acquired from the accused (and material obtained indirectly therefrom) has not assisted the prosecution in a material way.

2. His Honour erred in failing to make orders in accordance with paragraph 3 of the notice of motion.

Paragraph 3 of the motions sought:

‘3. The CDPP identify:

(a)   the name of all persons who have had access to the Accusatorial Process Material or Indirect Accusatorial Process Material whom the Crown proposed to call as witnesses or who have assisted;

(b)   in the preparation and conduct of these proceedings;

(c)   what Accusatorial Process Material or Indirect Accusatorial Process Material those person(s) have had access to;

(d)   when those person(s) have had access to the Accusatorial Process Material or Indirect Accusatorial Process Material.’

3. His Honour erred in upholding the claims to client legal privilege by the Crown Prosecutor and the Australian Crime Commission regarding communications between persons who had accessed and analysed compulsorily acquired material, on the one hand and, on the other, former or current prosecutors.

4. His Honour erred in refusing to make an order in accordance with paragraph 6 of the notice of motion until (a) client legal privilege is waived and (b) the Court is satisfied and (c) the accused has an opportunity to test that material compulsorily acquired from the accused (and material obtained indirectly therefrom) has not assisted the prosecution in a material way.

Paragraph 6 of the motions sought:

‘6. An order temporarily staying these proceedings pending:

(a)   The CDPP’s compliance with paragraph 3 of this Notice of Motion;

(b)   The engagement of other counsel and CDPP personnel who have not read or listened to the Accusatorial Process Material or Indirect Accusatorial Process Material; and

(c)   The filing and serving of a Crown case statement (howsoever called) and particulars of the charge which have not been derived from Accusatorial Process Material or Indirect Accusatorial Process Material.’

5. His Honour erred in finding that relief in paragraphs 2, 3 and/or 6 of the notice of motion could not be warranted where prosecutors have received opinion or analysis derived from compulsory acquired material but which was not identified as being so derived.

Paragraph 2 of the motions sought:

“2.   An order that all persons (including legal practitioners) who have read or listened to the Accusatorial Process Material or Indirect Accusatorial Process Material be prohibited from (a) giving evidence in these proceedings; (b) assisting the Commonwealth DPP in the preparation and conduct of these proceedings; (c) being retained or engaged by the Commonwealth DPP in the conduct of these proceedings.”

Paragraphs 3 and 6 of the motions are set out above.

6. His Honour erred in holding that it was unnecessary to determine for the purposes of granting relief in paragraphs 2 and 6 of the notice of motion whether Mr Tang or Ms Simpkin played a role in formulating or determining the charge as particularised.

Paragraphs 2 and 6 of the motions are set out above.

7. His Honour erred in failing to find that compulsorily acquired material had assisted, or there was a real risk it had assisted, the prosecution in a material way.

Paragraph 8 of the notice of motion

8. His Honour erred in failing to find that the compulsory examinations were impermissible because (a) the ACC’s investigation of the accused had ended or substantially ended (b) the decision to carry out the examinations was for, or took into account, an improper purpose (being to lock the accused into a story and to lock the accused in to inconsistencies to assist the prosecution) and (c) that improper purpose was carried into effect.

9. His Honour erred in refusing to grant a permanent stay.”


	
	These grounds can be conveniently divided into two categories. The first, the subject of grounds 1-4, relates to the primary judge’s alleged error in his evaluation of evidence or failure to require the Crown to produce certain material.
	
	
	The second, the subject of grounds 5-9, relates to the refusal by the primary judge to grant a temporary or permanent stay. Grounds 5-7 relate to the refusal to grant a temporary stay until a new prosecution team is appointed. By contrast, grounds 8 and 9, relate to the refusal to grant a permanent stay.
	
	
	The question of whether a temporary stay should be imposed arises if the Court is of the view that it is inappropriate to grant a permanent stay but, notwithstanding, some relief is necessary to ensure a fair trial.
	
	
	In these circumstances, it is convenient to deal first with grounds 1-4, then with the refusal to grant a permanent stay and then with whether a temporary stay should be granted, pending fulfilment of the requirements set out in pars 2(b), 2(c) and 6 of the notices of motion. It should be noted that the only potential witness who was said to have been privy to the examination transcripts and the compulsorily acquired material, Mr Tang, has been prohibited from giving evidence, so relief under par 2(a) of the notices of motion is unnecessary.
	


A The respondents’ submissions on grounds 1-4


	
	In relation to ground 1 of the notice of appeal, the respondents contended that the Crown bore an evidential onus to satisfy the Court that the material wrongfully disseminated has not assisted the prosecution in a material way. The respondents submitted that the primary judge erred as he made no finding on that issue.
	
	
	The respondents submitted that the High Court in Lee (2014) explicitly referred to the responsibilities of the Crown. They submitted that as the Crown did not proffer material necessary to test derivative use, the Court should require disclosure of such material to ensure that the trial is fair. The respondents submitted that an analogy could be drawn from the line of authority where courts have restrained solicitors from appearing in cases against their former clients where they are in possession of confidential information obtained from that client. They referred to the well-known statements of Brooking JA in Spincode Pty Ltd v Look Software Pty Ltd [2001] VSCA 248; 4 VR 501 to the effect that the onus lay on a solicitor to show that he or she was not acting in breach of fiduciary obligations or misusing confidential information in acting for a former client. They also referred to the approach taken in the United States to the admission of evidence obtained illegally. In the United States, this evidence is inadmissible unless the prosecution shows that the evidence would have inevitably been obtained, so that the prosecutor was in the same position as if the illegality had not occurred: Nix v Williams 467 US 431 (1984) at 442-443.
	
	
	Senior counsel for Mr McCarthy accepted that the evidentiary onus and legal responsibility of the prosecutor for which his clients contended is not engaged when the risk is merely speculative but only where, as he described it, there was a real risk of some infection. He referred again to the knowledge acquired by Mr Tang and Ms Simpkin from the material and its dissemination to the CDPP. He submitted that Mr Tang and Ms Simpkin should have been quarantined from the prosecution, in particular, from the present counsel for the Crown and the senior counsel’s predecessor, Mr Hastings QC. He submitted that, by contrast, they were involved in the preparation of the case for a lengthy period of time.
	
	
	In relation to ground 2, it was contended that the purpose of the order sought in par 3 of the notices of motion was first, to aid the enforcement of the requirement that the trial be fair and second, to know the extent of derivative use, with a view to quarantining such material if found. The respondents likened it to an action in aid of a Mareva injunction.
	
	
	So far as ground 3 was concerned, the respondents contended that there had been an implied or imputed waiver of legal professional privilege in respect of material to which privilege was claimed at the hearing before the primary judge. The respondents submitted that “inconsistency is grounded in either the duty of the prosecutor or the need for the court to ensure fairness …”. Alternatively, they submitted that as the Crown asserted that it had not benefited from the material in the way the case is now being propounded, it was incumbent to waive privilege on communications “in which it was on the cards that compulsorily acquired material was disclosed or where it is on the cards that the communication to the Crown were aided by compulsorily acquired material, inexplicitly [sic]”.
	
	
	Senior counsel for Mr McCarthy submitted that the critical error made was that the primary judge did not consider or recognise the inconsistency between the maintenance of the privilege and the position taken by the Crown on the notices of motion. He submitted that it was inconsistent with the maintenance of the privilege to state that Mr Tang and Ms Simpkin provided no assistance to the CDPP. He submitted that this meant that the respondents were not permitted to cross-examine them on whether there was a real risk that the compulsorily acquired material had assisted the prosecutors.
	
	
	Alternatively, the respondents relied on ground 4, submitting that without elaboration, if a court cannot compel a waiver of privilege, it should protect its processes by granting a temporary stay until the privilege is waived.
	


B The Crown’s submissions on grounds 1-4


	
	In relation to ground 1, the Crown submitted that the obligations of prosecuting counsel do not carry with them the burden of disproving that the Crown was assisted in a material way by a compulsory examination. It submitted that the position established by the authorities was that the answers given in a compulsory examination cannot be tendered and that prosecuting counsel and their instructing solicitors are not permitted to have heard or read the answers given under compulsion. It was submitted that there was no further constraint which the Crown must show it has complied with to satisfy its responsibility to assist in affording a fair trial. It submitted that the Crown’s position was in no way comparable to the position of a solicitor who has obligations of confidence to his or her former client.
	
	
	So far as ground 2 was concerned, the Crown submitted that the substantive requirement of the order sought in par 3 of the notices of motion had been complied with in a letter the CDPP sent to the respondents’ solicitors on 26 June 2014. It was submitted that the latter part of the definition of “accusatorial process material” and “indirect accusatorial process material”, namely, material “obtained indirectly by the ACC or the CDPP from the use of” compulsorily acquired material, was uncertain and impractically wide. It was submitted that it would require the Crown to identify all such material, some of which may be irrelevant, and to establish who might have had access to it.
	
	
	The Crown pointed out that the letter of 26 June 2014 annexed a two page schedule identifying those officers of the CDPP who had access to the transcript and the briefing papers which referred to the examinations. Documents produced under subpoena recorded the names of officers who were given access to the accusatorial process material and when this access occurred.
	
	
	The Crown pointed out that there was no attempt to tender the letter and that the order sought in par 3 of the notices of motion was not actively pressed at the hearing before the primary judge.
	
	
	In relation to the claim for privilege the subject of ground 3 of the notice of appeal, the Crown pointed out the claim was dealt with by the primary judge in a separate judgment: R v Seller; R v McCarthy (No 4) [2014] NSWSC 1369 (privilege judgment). The Crown pointed out by reference to that judgment that the claim that the privilege was wrongly maintained was first put on the basis that the ACC was acting unlawfully and therefore, the privilege claimed could not be maintained: privilege judgment at [12]. The Crown noted that this argument was not pursued in the appeal.
	
	
	The alternative basis on which it was claimed privilege was lost at the hearing of the motions was that there was a real question as to what was described as “‘infection’ of the lawyers by way of things that they may well have been told by Mr Tang and Ms Simpkin”: privilege judgment at [13]. The claim for privilege prevented that matter from being explored. The primary judge summarised this claim as “the Director had, by maintaining the prosecution in those particular circumstances, ‘acted in a way that is inconsistent with the claim for privilege”: privilege judgment at [14]. It was this argument which was pressed upon appeal.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that what was said in Lee (2014), to the effect that the Crown must ensure its case is presented in such a way as to ensure a fair trial, did not place an onus on the Crown to satisfy the Court that compulsorily acquired material had been quarantined. The Crown submitted that the only relevant stipulation was that prosecuting counsel and solicitors should not have access or knowledge of compulsorily acquired answers. It was submitted that such access had not occurred in the present case.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the prosecutor’s duty of disclosure did not override legal professional privilege.
	
	
	The Crown also submitted that if its submissions on this ground were upheld, ground 4 must fail.
	


Consideration

Ground 1


	
	It was first contended that the duty imposed on the prosecutor extended to satisfying the Court that the compulsorily acquired material and material obtained indirectly from it had not assisted the prosecution in a material way.
	
	
	In Lee (2014), the Crown prosecutor had possession of the compulsorily acquired material and, although he thought that was unusual, he took no steps to draw it to the attention of the Court. It was in that context that the Court remarked that it is the prosecution’s responsibility to ensure that a case is presented properly and with fairness to the accused and, in fulfilment of that duty, the prosecution should have inquired as to the circumstances in which the material came into its possession and alerted the trial judge to the situation: Lee (2014) at [44].
	
	
	Such an obligation is consistent with the general obligations imposed upon Crown prosecutors to act fairly in discharging the functions they perform at a criminal trial, in order to assist the attainment of justice between the Crown and the accused: Whitehorn v The Queen [1983] HCA 42; 152 CLR 657 at 664-665, 675; Australian Securities and Investment Commission v Hellicar [2012] HCA 17; 247 CLR 345 at 353-354; Attorney-General (NT) v Emmerson [2014] HCA 13; 88 ALJR 522 at [63].
	
	
	In the present case, the fact that the material was available to the prosecuting authorities was disclosed. The matters to which I have referred at [36]-[54] above were drawn to the attention of the respondents and the primary judge.
	
	
	Further, during the hearing of the motions, the following exchange occurred between senior counsel for Mr McCarthy and the primary judge:
	


“HIS HONOUR: Just to be completely clear, Mr Strickland, you accept that no one in the current prosecution team has read the CEs or the section 28 material?

STRICKLAND: Yes.

HIS HONOUR: You accept Mr Fagan’s proposition from the Bar Table that it goes without saying that if Mr Tang had made an explicit reference to something like that at a conference, that would have been brought to your attention?

STRICKLAND: Yes. My explicit reference, by saying to Mr Fagan, ‘Mr McCarthy said at his compulsory examination X, Y, Z’; correct.

HIS HONOUR: So we’re speaking of implicit references whereby, as we have discussed today, Mr Tang’s mental processes and levelled understanding has been informed by the compulsory material and he has conveyed that to the lawyers involved?

STRICKLAND: It could have been Mr Tang says, ‘In my belief the defence will be X, Y and Z’ and X, Y and Z is an explicit reference. The words ‘explicit reference, X, Y and Z’ is in fact sourced directly from the compulsory examinations but it’s not explicitly referred to as that.

HIS HONOUR: No lawyer would know that.

STRICKLAND: No lawyer would know that. In other words, I accept the assurances from my learned friend, of course I do, that neither he, nor Mr McGuire, know directly that they have been passed some unlawful material because I accept that if they had done so, they would have told us. But this is not a matter about those personal assurances, which I accept, it goes beyond that.”


	
	It seems to me that in circumstances where the dissemination of material was disclosed, an assurance was accepted that no one in the prosecution team had read the compulsory examination transcript or the s 28 material and if there had been explicit reference to that material, it would have been drawn to the Court’s attention, any prosecutorial duty was satisfied. Whether this was sufficient to enable the prosecution to proceed or whether the proceedings should be stayed is dealt with later in this judgment.
	
	
	In relation to the evidential onus referred to in this ground, for the trial to proceed, the Court must be satisfied that it would not result in the trial being unfair such that there is nothing the trial judge can do to relieve against the unfairness: X7 v R [2014] NSWCCA 273 at [82] ff (X7 (No 2)). This is also the subject of the appeal against the refusal to grant a stay.
	
	
	However, contrary to the submission of the respondents, I do not think that any assistance can be gained from the approach taken by the Courts in circumstances where a solicitor seeks to act against the interests of his or her former clients. Whether the restriction on so acting in particular (but not all) cases is put on the basis of the possible misuse of confidential information, a breach of a fiduciary duty, or simply as a matter of fairness and justice (see above the discussion in Spincode by Brooking JA and the cases cited therein), it has no relevance to this field of discourse.
	
	
	It follows that ground 1 does not provide any separate basis for relief. There is no obligation in the circumstances of the present case for the prosecutor to produce any further material. It is necessary for the Court to decide, on the material available to it, whether a permanent or temporary stay should be granted.
	


Ground 2


	
	The order sought in par 3 of the notices of motion, in effect, sought that the CDPP identify the names of all persons who had access to the accusatorial process material and indirect accusatorial process material who were to be called as witnesses or who participated in the preparation and conduct of the proceedings.
	
	
	As I indicated, the Crown submitted that an order in terms of par 3 of the notices of motion was not actively pursued at the hearing before the primary judge. That proposition was not disputed at the hearing and no such argument was addressed in ground 2 of the notice of appeal. Rather, ground 1 was said to be relied on as ancillary to grounds 3-9. Thus, senior counsel for Mr McCarthy stated “Part 1 [of the notice of appeal], all the grounds with the probable exception of ground 2 in our submissions are linked and need to be seen together”. The submissions then focused on documents relating to the conversations between past and present counsel representing the Crown and officers of the CDPP and the ACC in respect of which privilege was claimed. This was the subject of ground 3 of the notice of appeal.
	
	
	Further, both in written submissions and orally, the Crown stated that a letter dated 26 June 2014 from the CDPP to the solicitors acting for the respondents provided the information sought in par 3 of the notices of motion, to the extent that it related to persons who in fact had access to the transcript and compulsorily acquired material. This was not disputed by the respondents.
	
	
	In these circumstances, it is not appropriate that leave be granted to make the order sought in ground 2 of the notice of appeal.

	The primary judge upheld the claim for legal professional privilege in respect of the following documents:

	As noted above, the claim for legal professional privilege was upheld in a separate judgment. In the privilege judgment, the primary judge’s conclusion on the question of waiver was as follows:
	


“[29]   I also accepted without difficulty the proposition that there are certain cases in which a claim for privilege can be inconsistent with the maintenance of the proceedings themselves, and as a result the claim should not be upheld: see generally DSE (Holdings) v Intertain Inc [2003] FCA 384, 127 FCR 499 (the submission that merely by joining issue on the pleadings with an allegation made by one’s opponent that one had a certain state of mind led to waiver of privilege with regard to legal advice connected to that state of mind was rejected); Telstra Corporation Ltd and Another v BT Australasia Pty Ltd v Another (1998) 85 FCR 152, (by majority, privilege found to have been waived with regard to legal advice relevant to reliance by inconsistency in pleading an action founded upon reliance on the representations of the defendant). Perhaps the paradigm would be civil proceedings in which a client sues his or her legal adviser for having given negligent advice, and the client relies upon evidence as to what passed between the client and the lawyer. If the lawyer sought in response to provide his or her alternative version as to what had been said between the two of them, it is inconceivable that the client would be permitted to claim privilege, thereby prohibiting the lawyer from placing his or her version of the crucial conversations before the court for determination.

[30]   But that paradigm, in which a successful claim of privilege would really make a forensic response of the opponent to the cause of action impossible, is very far from the circumstances of this case. The evidential foundation of the criminal cause of action brought by the Director against the two accused is, in a nutshell, the untruthful things they allegedly said and wrote many years ago. It is true that the access by Mr Tang and Ms Simpkin to the compulsorily acquired material, and the use they may have made of it subsequently, were important issues on the motion. However, when it comes to assessing true inconsistency between, on the one hand, claiming client legal privilege with regard to a number of legal conferences in which they engaged and, on the other hand, with the maintenance of a prosecution founded on events years beforehand, I assess the conduct of the Director as being by no means inconsistent, in the sense described in the cases to which I was invited.”


	
	There is force in the proposition that the primary judge did not consider the actual basis upon which waiver was said to have occurred, namely, that the maintenance of the privilege was inconsistent with the assertion that the transcripts of examination and compulsorily acquired material provided no benefit to the prosecution. His Honour’s reasoning, which I have set out above, instead focused on the inconsistency between the maintenance of the privilege and what he described as the maintenance of the prosecution. Rather, he should have focused on whether maintenance of the privilege was inconsistent with the Crown’s contention on the hearing of the notices of motion that the distribution of the transcripts and compulsorily acquired material did not give any forensic advantage to the Crown which deprived the respondents of a trial according to law.
	
	
	However, in determining if there was such an inconsistency, it is important to consider the manner in which the Crown put its case. First, it asserted that the evidence it would seek to adduce at the trial was not in any way dependent on the evidence adduced at the examinations or on the compulsorily acquired material. Second, it emphasised that no present member of the prosecution team had seen that material. The respondents, while accepting the latter proposition, stated that it was not enough, as there may have been what senior counsel for Mr McCarthy described in the Court below as unknowing, unconscious or indirect receipt of such material. They cited as an example the possibility that such disclosures occurred between Mr Tang and Ms Simpkin and the prosecution team during the course of the discussion of possible defences.
	
	
	That possibility is relevant in considering whether the trial should be stayed. The Crown, in both its written and oral submissions, described this possibility as fanciful, pointing to the fact that neither the documents to be tendered nor the evidence to be led made any reference or placed any reliance on the compulsorily acquired material.
	
	
	An imputed waiver of the nature raised in the present case will arise when conduct is inconsistent with the maintenance of the confidentiality the privilege is intended to protect. What brings about the waiver is the inconsistency which the Courts, informed by considerations of fairness, perceive between the conduct of the client and maintenance of the confidentiality, not some overriding principle of fairness operating at large: Mann v Carnell [1999] HCA 66; 201 CLR 1 at [29]; Osland v Secretary Department of Justice [2008] HCA 37; 234 CLR 275 at [45]. As the plurality observed in the latter case (at [49]), this is a question of fact and degree.
	
	
	Applying these principles, it does not seem to me that the assertion of indirect disclosure by the respondents and its rejection by the Crown, in the manner to which I have referred, compels the conclusion that privilege in the documents has been waived. A denial of such indirect communications is not inconsistent with the maintenance of privilege. Nor, having regard to the manner in which the case was conducted by the Crown, is there any unfairness in the maintenance of the privilege.
	
	
	It follows that this ground of appeal has not been made out.
	


Ground 4


	
	It would be inappropriate in my opinion for a judge to stay proceedings until legal profession privilege properly claimed is waived.
	
	
	It is correct that in Lee (2014), the Court stated (at [44]) that one of the purposes of alerting the trial judge to the disclosure of compulsorily acquired material was so that steps could be taken to ensure the trial was not affected. However, this would not seem to me to extend to effectively compelling waiver of privilege to enable the accused to embark on an inquiry as to whether there had been inadvertent disclosure of material or whether it had been distributed to the prosecution team without the prosecution team being informed of its source. In this context, it is important to remember, as the High Court pointed out in Daniels Corporation International Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2002] HCA 49; 213 CLR 543 at [11], that legal professional privilege is not merely a matter of substantive law, but an important common law right or immunity. Courts should not compel waiver of that right or immunity where it is legitimately claimed.
	
	
	In these circumstances, any application for a stay will fall to be considered by reference to the evidence before the Court. It should be emphasised, contrary to what was suggested at one stage by senior counsel for Mr McCarthy, that no inference can be drawn against the Crown from the maintenance of the claim for privilege: Wentworth v Lloyd (1864) 10 HLC 589 at 590-592; Giannarelli v Wraith (No 2) [1991] HCA 2; 171 CLR 592 at 605.
	
	
	It follows that this ground of appeal is not made out.
	


Should a permanent or temporary stay have been granted

The respondents’ submissions


	
	The respondents sought a permanent stay on two grounds. First, applying the principles in X7 and Lee (2014), the disclosure of the information gave rise to a departure from the accusatorial mode of the criminal justice system in a fundamental respect: X7 at [93], [124], [136]; Lee (2014) at [31], [32], [41]. Second, on the basis that the examination was conducted for an improper purpose.
	
	
	The respondents submitted that the factual material to which I have referred above demonstrated that Mr Tang and Ms Simpkin knew what the accused’s defences would be to particular allegations if made. They pointed out that the examination proceeded as cross-examination designed to lock the accused into a story.
	
	
	The respondents referred to the fact that Mr Tang and Ms Simpkin prepared extensive briefing papers, provided them to the CDPP and attended conferences with lawyers, counsel and case managers engaged and retained by the CDPP, the purpose of which included consideration of charges and particulars and what evidence to present.
	
	
	The respondents pointed out that the transcripts of the examination were distributed to the former prosecution team. They submitted that there was a real and sensible possibility or risk that during meetings attended by one or more members of the current prosecution team, junior counsel Mr McGuire and Ms Curry, proposed charges, likely defences and explanations by the accused were discussed.
	
	
	The respondents submitted that X7 recognised that the accusatorial process is fundamental and a critical factor is that the prosecution must prove the guilt of the accused without his or her assistance. The respondents submitted that that case demonstrated that that principle could not be compromised.
	
	
	The respondents submitted that if there is material prejudice, the trial would be unfair and not a trial according to law. They submitted that toleration of the risk of actual prejudice is no different in principle. The respondents submitted that these propositions extended not just to the trial but to the whole course of the criminal process.
	
	
	The respondents submitted that the illegal dissemination of material may constitute a fundamental departure from the right to a fair trial. They submitted that such dissemination involved departure, in a fundamental respect, from a criminal trial which the system of justice requires, namely, the prosecutor being armed with compulsorily acquired evidence.
	
	
	The respondents submitted that the quarantine process outlined in Lee (2014) (at [44]) should apply to material obtained indirectly from compulsorily acquired material. They submitted that given that the Act does not permit derivative use of the applicants’ examination transcript, it cannot be consistent with a fair trial where such transcripts have been disseminated unlawfully and to an unknown extent. It was submitted that in those circumstances, the onus to demonstrate that the trial was fair shifts to the prosecution.
	
	
	So far as grounds 5 and 7 were concerned, the respondents submitted that the primary judge erred in concluding that the relief sought in pars 2, 3 and 6 of the notices of motion constituted a large extension of the principles to be found in Lee (2014).
	
	
	Senior counsel for Mr McCarthy, in describing grounds 5 and 7 as one ground with separate aspects, said that these grounds are based on an error by the primary judge at [73]-[75] of his judgment, which I have set out at [68] above.
	
	
	The respondents submitted that the fact that the current prosecutors had not been provided with compulsorily acquired material is not the end of the matter. It was submitted that the primary judge failed to consider that there was a real risk that the material had been provided to the prosecutors without them being told it was compulsorily acquired material. They pointed to the fact that the evidence disclosed that from February 2006, the CDPP had advised the ACC, including Mr Tang, that they should focus on dishonesty and lies. They repeated the submission that Mr Tang and Ms Simpkin had read the compulsory examination transcript looking for lies by the accused and the plan to lock the respondents into a version of events which could be used for cross-examination. They also repeated the submission that Mr Tang and Ms Simpkin had attended meetings to discuss substantive charges.
	
	
	The respondents pointed out that Mr Tang did not consider it improper or illegal to disseminate the information to the prosecutors. They also pointed out that he regarded what the accused had said as important to a charge based on alleged lies.
	
	
	In this context, senior counsel for Mr McCarthy pointed out that the Crown case statement in December 2009 was similar in many respects to the current Crown case statement and that Ms Simpkin and Mr Tang were involved in the formulation of the charges.
	
	
	Senior counsel for the respondents accepted that it may be true that evidence acquired derivatively from answers given under compulsion is sometimes admissible, but stated there were occasions when such evidence would not be admitted at trial. He referred to what I said in the first appeal at [102]-[106], in particular at [104]. He submitted that these statements were consistent with what was said by French CJ and Crennan J in X7 at [58].
	
	
	So far as ground 6 was concerned, the respondents submitted that the primary judge paid undue regard to the finding that an independent judgment was exercised with regard to the filing of the bill of indictment. They submitted that quarantining should have required that particulars of the indictment be prepared without access or regard to the material that should be quarantined. They submitted that the Crown case remained in a substantially similar form since the commencement of the proceedings in late 2009. They submitted that the lies now alleged were a subset of what was proposed in 2009.
	
	
	In respect of grounds 8 and 9, the respondents submitted that a stay was justified having regard to the circumstances in which the examinations occurred. They said that the original plan was to lock the respondents into a story and then question them on inconsistencies. They submitted that this occurred at a time when the relevant case officer believed that the investigative phase had concluded, although they accepted in their submissions that the examination subsequently resumed. They submitted that the examination was conducted as a cross-examination and that the final examination addressed inconsistencies in the manner planned.
	
	
	The respondents submitted that the primary judge erred in concluding that Ms Simpkin’s purposes were hardly significant. They also submitted that he erred in stating that if a permanent stay was appropriate, it would have been granted in X7 or Lee (2014), as in those cases such an order was not sought.
	
	
	The respondents submitted that the primary judge should have found that the examinations were conducted for an improper purpose, to assist the prosecution by locking them into a story. Further, they submitted that there was no proper purpose by September 2007 because Ms Simpkin considered the investigative phase as complete. They relied on what was said by Hayne and Bell JJ in X7 at [153].
	


The Crown’s submissions


	
	The Crown submitted that there was no basis for the proposition that when an investigative agency has obtained information under compulsion from a person subsequently accused, a trial cannot proceed unless the Crown satisfies the court that neither the compulsorily acquired material nor any material obtained from it has assisted the prosecution in any way. However, as I understand it, the respondents’ submission in the present case was based on the fact that the material had been illegally supplied to the CDPP.
	
	
	In the present case, the Crown pointed out that the information was acquired compulsorily pursuant to the powers of the ACC contained in the Act. It was submitted that the test propounded by the respondents would require that in every case where a trial was preceded by an investigation involving a compulsory process, the Crown should present for scrutiny the entire history of the compilation of its brief, the prosecutor’s review and consideration of that brief and any other aspect of preparation and development of the case.
	
	
	The Crown, referring to the first appeal at [80]-[81], submitted that evidence acquired derivatively from answers given under compulsion is admissible on the trial of the examinee.
	
	
	In relation to grounds 5 and 7, the Crown described the proposition that compulsorily acquired material could have been provided to the prosecutors without their being aware of it as fanciful. It submitted that the respondents had been provided with all documents to be tendered and statements of oral evidence to be given, none of which included or contained any reference to the material acquired from the compulsory examinations.
	
	
	The Crown also submitted that the other matters referred to at [181] above were entirely irrelevant to the fairness of the prospective trial.
	
	
	So far as ground 6 was concerned, the Crown described the concept of investigators as having played a role in formulating or determining the charge as particularised as unrealistic. The Crown submitted that any views Mr Tang or Ms Simpkin may hold or might have communicated to counsel or previous prosecutors regarding the sustainability of the charges and their drafting could not be of assistance to the Crown.
	
	
	The Crown pointed out that responsibility to independently determine what charges and particulars are appropriate rests on counsel who will conduct the case for the Crown at trial. In these circumstances, it was submitted that there was no scope for investigators such as Ms Simpkin or Mr Tang to effect the formulation and presentation of the Crown case.
	
	
	In regard to grounds 8 and 9, the Crown submitted that the purpose of the compulsory examination was irrelevant, in that the Crown did not propose to tender any evidence which had been obtained by their conduct.
	
	
	The Crown also submitted that even if the primary judge should have found that the investigators acted improperly, that was irrelevant to the question of a stay as the story into which the respondents were said to have been locked into had never been disclosed to the prosecutors, will not be tendered and thus cannot have any bearing on the trial.
	


Consideration


	
	In X7 (No 2), I reviewed X7 and the subsequent authorities and the circumstances in which Courts will grant a permanent stay of proceedings. I do not propose to repeat what I have said in that case but there are a number of propositions which are relevant to the present case.
	
	
	First, the majority in X7, in holding that the Act did not authorise compulsory examination of a person relating to the subject matter of offences for which he or she has been charged, emphasised that such an examination would radically alter the process of criminal justice to a marked degree. This was so whether or not the answers were admissible or kept secret from those investigating or prosecuting the charge. This, it was said, would radically alter what was otherwise a wholly accusatorial process: X7 at [70], [71], [85], [87], [118] per Hayne and Bell JJ, [159], [160] per Keifel J; X7 (No 2) at [20], [21].
	
	
	Second, this conclusion did not depend on classifying the trial as an unfair trial. The relevant question was whether the accused had a trial according to law: X7 at [89]; X7 (No 2) at [25].
	
	
	Third, the principles in X7 were affirmed in Lee (2014): Lee (2014) at [31], [32], [41], [46]; X7 (No 2) at [54]-[57]; see also Commissioner of Australian Federal Police v Zhao [2015] HCA 5 at [18].
	
	
	Fourth, as was pointed out in Lee (2014), the prosecutor has an obligation to alert the trial judge to any relevant disclosure of compulsorily acquired material so that steps can be taken to ensure the trial is not affected: Lee (2014) at [44].
	
	
	Fifth, neither X7 nor Lee (2014) compel the conclusion that the fact of an unauthorised examination on its own requires a permanent stay of proceedings. To grant a permanent stay in these circumstances would be to do so without regard to the nature and extent of unfairness which results and would fail to take into account the interests of the community in the prosecution of serious criminal offences.
	
	
	Sixth, the authorities dealing with the question of the grant of a permanent stay emphasise three matters. First, the power is one that will rarely be exercised. This is unsurprising having regard to the interests of the community and the victims of crime in the enforcement of the criminal law: X7 (No 2) at [91]. Second, a stay will only be ordered where there is a fundamental defect of such a nature that there is nothing a judge can do in the context of a trial to relieve against its unfair consequences: X7 (No 2) at [92]. Third, irrespective of whether or not unfairness is demonstrated, a stay may be granted if the proceedings in question are an abuse of process, in the sense that the use of the court proceedings brings the administration of justice into disrepute: X7 (No 2) at [93].
	
	
	In the present case, the circumstances are different to X7. The examination occurred before any charges were laid and was not illegal, nor did it amount to contempt of court: cf Hammond v The Commonwealth of Australia [1982] HCA 42; 152 CLR 188.
	
	
	Notwithstanding these differences, in my opinion the disclosure had the same effect as that referred to in X7. In X7, French CJ and Crennan J emphasised the importance of a direction under s 25A(9) of the Act, stating that such a direction must be made if the failure to do so would prejudice a fair trial: at [26].
	
	
	Similarly, in Lee (2014), the Court observed the importance of s 13(9) of the New South Wales Crime Commission Act 1985 (NSW) (the equivalent of s 25A(9) of the Act) in protecting the right of an accused person to a fair trial: at [20]-[34].
	
	
	As in Lee (2014), it was not in issue in the present case that the dissemination should not have occurred. However, unlike Lee (2014), a prosecution team which was not privy to the compulsory examination transcripts or the compulsorily acquired material has been appointed. Further, the only potential witness privy to that material, Mr Tang, has been excluded from giving evidence.
	
	
	In these circumstances, it does not seem to me that the mere fact of dissemination warrants a permanent stay. On its face, it does not seem to me that dissemination to persons not involved in the conduct of the trial would make the trial unfair or alter the accusatorial process of a criminal trial to such an extent as to warrant a permanent stay.
	
	
	It remains to be considered whether the particular matters the subject of grounds 5-7 of the notice of appeal warrant either the grant of a permanent stay or the relief sought in either pars 2 or 6 of the notices of motion.
	
	
	In that context, it should be noted that, to the extent the order sought in par 2 of the notices of motion sought orders that persons who had read or listened to the accusatorial process material be prohibited from giving evidence, the only person who fell into that category was Mr Tang, who has been prohibited from doing so.
	
	
	Grounds 5 and 7 of the notice of appeal focus primarily on the proposition that the content of the examinations and the compulsorily acquired material have been disclosed to the current prosecuting team without their knowledge. I have dealt with this submission to some extent in my consideration of ground 3. At risk of repetition, in circumstances where the Crown case does not depend on any of that material and where the assurance on behalf of the current team that they have not read the transcripts or such material has been accepted, this possibility is, at most, speculative.
	
	
	In dealing with these grounds, senior counsel for Mr McCarthy stated that they were based on what he described as an error at [73]-[75] of the primary judgment, which I have set out at [68] above. He submitted that if the current prosecution team had been provided with such material then it would follow that the position was the same as that in Lee (2014).
	
	
	I have set out the factual material on which the respondents rely in support of the proposition that there was “a real risk” that the compulsorily acquired material had assisted the prosecution. That material establishes that Mr Tang and Ms Simpkin were assisted in their work on behalf of the ACC by the transcripts of the compulsorily acquired material. However, it does not lead to the conclusion that such material was in fact disclosed to the prosecution team or that it has assisted them in any way in the preparation of the case against the respondents.
	
	
	I am prepared to assume that there is a possibility that at some stage Mr Tang, for example, may have said something to the prosecutors based on what he had read in the transcripts or the compulsorily acquired material. The primary judge was also prepared to assume that possibility.
	
	
	However, I do not believe that this possibility warrants either a permanent stay or orders in the nature of pars 2 and 6 of the notices of motion. There was no direct disclosure. Further, the legislation does not prohibit any communication between persons who attended the examination or were privy to the confidential material and prosecutors. It only prohibits disclosure of material the subject of the s 25A(9) direction. The possibility that something was said which may have related back to the examination cannot, in my view, lead to the prohibition of a prosecutor, who may not know that he or she has been appraised of that material, from continuing to act.
	
	
	Further, the ACC is required by s 12 of the Act to make available to the relevant law enforcement authority evidence that will be admissible in the prosecution of an offence. In considering whether an offence was committed for the purpose of compliance with this section, the legislation does not prevent an officer of the ACC drawing upon information received as a result of the examination. That indeed seems to be one of the purposes of such an examination. What the officer of the ACC cannot do is disclose such material to law enforcement authorities if relevant directions under s 25A(9) have been made.
	
	
	In these circumstances, I do not consider that the possibility of an unsourced disclosure in the present case is such as to warrant either a permanent stay or orders in the nature of those sought in pars 2 and 6 of the notices of motion. The primary judge, in the exercise of his discretion, was not in error in reaching a similar conclusion. The position may well have been different if it was established that such an unauthorised disclosure, even if unsourced, was made.
	
	
	It was also contended in ground 6 that the primary judge erred in the exercise of his discretion in not dealing with the roles of Ms Simpkin and Mr Tang in the formulation of the charge. It was not in dispute that the current prosecuting team, after reviewing admissible evidence, determined that the charge was appropriate. In those circumstances, it is difficult to see why fairness or a trial according to law requires a further exercise of that nature. The primary judge, accepting the possibility that Mr Tang and Ms Simpkin may have been party to the formulation of the charges against the respondents, considered that this did not warrant the order sought in par 6. He was not in error in doing so.
	
	
	The alternate ground upon which a stay was sought was that the examination was conducted for an improper purpose. The purpose was apparently to lock the respondents into a story and then cross-examine them on any inconsistencies between their version of events and the documents available to the ACC. It was said that this occurred at a time that Ms Simpkin believed the investigation had been completed.
	
	
	Section 24A of the Act provides that “An examiner may conduct an examination for the purpose of a special ACC operation/investigation.” A “special ACC operation/investigation” is relevantly defined as “an investigation into matters relating to federally relevant criminal activity that the ACC is conducting and that the Board has determined to be a special investigation.”
	
	
	There was no dispute that the investigation into the whiskey schemes fell within that definition.
	
	
	If the examination of the respondents was carried out for another purpose other than an investigation into those schemes it would amount to an abuse of power. However, even if the purpose was to lock the respondents into a story and test inconsistency, it does not seem to me that that was necessarily inconsistent with investigating the schemes and the respondents’ role in them. One aspect of the investigation would be to obtain the respondents’ explanation of their activities and test its veracity. That would seem to me to be a legitimate purpose, even if all other aspects of the investigation were taken to have been concluded.
	
	
	Further, even if the examination was conducted in excess of, or was an abuse of, the power conferred by s 24A of the Act, it would not follow that a stay should be granted. Such an abuse or excess would not make the proceedings against the respondents an abuse of process, as the proceedings do not depend on the contents of the examination. Further, the transcripts of the examination are not admissible in evidence and, as previously stated, are not available to the prosecution team. In these circumstances, even if the examinations were in excess or abuse of power, it would not result in a permanent or temporary stay of the proceedings.
	


Conclusion


	
	In these circumstances, leave should be granted to the respondents to appeal from the decision of the primary judge on the grounds contained in pars 1, 3-9 inclusive of the further amended notice of application for leave to appeal, but the appeal should be dismissed.
	
	
	Since writing the above judgment, I have read the draft judgment of Fullerton J. I agree with her Honour’s reasons.
	


Orders


	
	The following orders should be made:
	



	
	Dismiss the appeal brought by the Crown.
	
	
	Grant each of Patrick David McCarthy and Ross Edward Seller leave to appeal on grounds 1, 3-9 inclusive of the further amended notice of application for leave to appeal filed by each of them on 3 October 2014, but dismiss the appeal.
	



	
	FULLERTON J: I have read the judgment of the Chief Justice and agree with the order his Honour proposes in dismissing the Crown appeal. I am grateful for his Honour’s comprehensive summary of the Crown case and the evidence the Crown proposes to adduce from Mr Tang in proof of its case, together with his Honour’s summary of the arguments of the parties.
	
	
	I would wish only to add my own view as to whether Lee v The Queen is authority for the proposition for which the respondents contend, namely that a witness who has been privy to compulsorily acquired information must be excluded from giving evidence in the trial of an accused. I agree with the Chief Justice that it is not necessary on this appeal to decide whether any witness that the Crown might call at trial who has been exposed to compulsorily acquired information must be excluded. I would, however, venture the view that in a particular case that question will depend on the material the witness has been exposed to, and the evidence the witness is to give at trial in proof of the charge or charges, in the context of the issues in dispute at trial in an adversarial setting where the Crown has the obligation of proving the guilt of an accused.
	
	
	Lee v The Queen is, however, authority for the proposition for which it was cited by the respondents on the appeal, namely that the fundamental and underlying tenet of a fair trial at common law is that it is for the prosecution to prove the guilt of an accused person, and that any risk of upsetting the balance between the power of the State to prosecute and the position of an individual who stands accused, by the dissemination of compulsorily acquired material is open to be remedied by discretionary orders of the trial judge of the kind made by the primary judge in this case.
	
	
	On the hearing of the appeal, the Crown submitted that the principles for which Lee v The Queen is authority do not dictate the exclusion of Mr Tang as a witness at the respondents’ trial, the Crown having not been put in a position of unfair advantage relative to the respondents either by reason of Mr Tang having had foreknowledge of the respondents’ answers given under compulsion, or because he has had access to other material produced under compulsion, in circumstances where the senior counsel who is to lead his evidence at trial has been quarantined from that information.
	
	
	As the Chief Justice has emphasised, it is not necessary that the respondents establish, as a matter of fact, that Mr Tang derived some form of improper forensic advantage in the preparation of his witness statement or the preparation of the summaries of the flow of funds from access to the compulsorily acquired information. It is sufficient that the fundamental entitlement the respondents have to a fair trial is not jeopardised by reason of that access. The trial judge’s assessment of the measure of that risk was discretionary and, for my part, an assessment with which I could not reasonably disagree.
	
	
	Further, again as noted by the Chief Justice, it is not determinative of the question whether a fair trial is jeopardised that the Crown prosecutor is unaware of the compulsorily acquired information to which Mr Tang has had access, even if that would serve to negate the risk of unfairness to the respondents in the evidence to be adduced from Mr Tang or the tender through him of the collation and summation of a large number of individual financial transactions in proof of the structure of the whiskey scheme and the flow of funds between the parties to it. Rather, what is determinative is the respondents’ entitlement to present or develop their defence through cross-examination of any Crown witness, including, in this case, Mr Tang, and the question whether that is at risk of being jeopardised were the cross-examiner to be forced to exercise constraint so that his questions do not trespass on the compulsorily acquired information or risk the exposure of that material.
	
	
	In this case, the risk that the respondents’ counsel will, or might, be limited or hindered in the structure and content of the cross-examination of Mr Tang cannot be excluded. It is for that reason, and in order to ensure that the trial is conducted in accordance with the primary tenet of fairness, that the discretionary judgment of the primary judge should not be disturbed.
	
	
	I also agree with the Chief Justice’s disposition of the respondents’ appeal and his Honour’s reasons for doing so. I would only wish to make my own observations as to an aspect of the argument advanced by the respondents in support of grounds 3 and 4.
	
	
	As the Chief Justice observed, those grounds are linked in that what was said to be error in the primary judge’s upholding of the Crown’s claim of legal client privilege has had the consequence that neither Mr Tang nor Ms Simpkin were able to be cross-examined in the pre-trial hearing to explore with them how they were able to quarantine any reference to the compulsorily acquired information in their various conferences with the CDPP.
	
	
	In support of the third ground of appeal, the respondents submitted that his Honour was in error in failing to find that there was an implied or imputed waiver of the privilege resulting from what was said to be inconsistency in the Crown’s assertion that neither Mr Tang nor Ms Simpkin provided any assistance to the CDPP in the conferences they attended on 20 and 23 July 2009 referable to the compulsorily acquired information, and the maintenance of the privilege over the conference notes and/or over any documents provided by Mr Tang and Ms Simpkin in those conferences.
	
	
	The respondents also submitted that the inconsistency was manifest by what his Honour should have accepted was the risk that the prosecution team was indirectly exposed to the compulsorily acquired information by Mr Tang and Ms Simpkin’s participation in conferences attended by prosecuting counsel. They submitted that, were there discussion in conference with the CDPP about the particular defences the respondents may assert at trial and/or the fact and detail of what the Crown relies upon as lies the respondents told officers of the ATO and how those lies might be proved to be lies at trial, there was the strong likelihood that both Mr Tang and Ms Simpkin might, consciously or unconsciously, draw on what they had learnt from the compulsory examinations in contributing to that discussion, even if the source of their views was not disclosed to the CDPP. For that reason, it was submitted that the trial should be stayed until that issue is fully explored in cross-examination.
	
	
	In addition to what the Chief Justice identified in the authorities cited at [164] as the limited circumstances in which waiver of privilege might be imputed to a party, and the even more limited circumstances where an inference can be drawn adverse to the party claiming the privilege at [169] (as to which, see also Standard Chartered Bank of Australia Ltd v Antico (1993) 36 NSWLR 87 per Hodgson J at [94] approved most recently in Cooper v Hobbs [2013] NSWCA 70), the respondents’ submission proceeds on the assumption that, within the privileged material, there would be a basis upon which it could be demonstrated that there had been dissemination to the CDPP of the compulsorily acquired material, including via conversations or communications in conference that were not recorded, or a reasonable possibility or a real risk that that had occurred. Despite attempts by senior counsel for the respondents in oral argument to establish that proposition by inference, I am not persuaded that it was elevated beyond a bare assertion.
	
	
	It seems to me that it does not follow that, because Mr Tang and Ms Simpkin attended what were described as “key meetings” in March 2008 and June 2009, and because they had an extensive knowledge of the history of the investigation leading up to the ultimate laying of the conspiracy charge, that their exposure to the compulsorily acquired information would, or even might, be disseminated by them in the course of conferences with prosecuting counsel and solicitors, or that within the privileged material there was any legitimate basis for raising that inference. As Mr Fagan SC submitted, and as the Chief Justice emphasised in his Honour’s analysis of the question, if the documents protected by the privilege revealed, whether patently or by necessary inference, that there had been communication of the content of the compulsory examinations or to the material compulsorily acquired from the respondents to anybody in the Crown prosecution team, including independent counsel retained by the CDPP, then that material would have to have been disclosed in discharge of prosecuting counsel’s overriding duty of disclosure. The respondents do not submit that Mr Fagan SC was in breach of this duty. To the contrary.
	
	
	In addition, I consider that there is some force in the Crown submission that the arguments advanced by the respondents’ counsel in support of ground 3, and its association with ground 4, have overlooked the independent role of prosecuting counsel. It was not in issue that it was Crown counsel, properly instructed, not the investigators, including Mr Tang and Ms Simpkin, who had the ultimate responsibility in this case to frame the charges to be prosecuted at trial and to settle the Crown case statement in elaboration of the charges. It was also not in serious contention that that was done referable to the evidence considered to be available and admissible at trial exclusive of the information which was wrongly disseminated.
	
	
	In my view, the respondents’ submission in support of the fourth ground of appeal also suffers from the same lack of scrutiny of the role of prosecuting counsel. If there were a plausible connection, or a real and not speculative possibility, that the wrongly disseminated compulsorily acquired information was either within the privilege material or, by necessary inference, based upon it, that information would have to be revealed, irrespective of its privilege status, in discharge of the prosecutor’s duty of disclosure.
	
	
	BELLEW J: I agree with Bathurst CJ. I also agree with the additional observation of Fullerton J.

2703525,R v Duffy (No. 3) [2015] NSWSC 481,"Judgment


	
	The Crown applies for leave under s 38 Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) to cross-examine the witness XY in respect of two matters. The first concerns her presence in the bedroom at the time the deceased was killed. The second concerns where she was in the room at the time she claimed to have entered it after the killing.
	
	
	Leave is sought in respect of the first matter on the basis that her evidence that she was not in the room at the time of the killing is unfavourable to the Crown. This is said to arise in particular because of the evidence of Scott Derbridge, what is likely to be the evidence of Rachael Evans and what the accused has said in interviews that XY was indeed in the room at the time of the killing. The Crown wants to be in the position of being able to suggest to the jury that they should prefer the evidence of Derbridge and Evans that XY was in the room. The Crown case is said to be that she was so present.
	
	
	Leave is sought in relation to the second issue by reason of a prior inconsistent statement made by the witness. In a walkthrough of the premises at 220 Rockbarton Road on 3 June 2012 the witness described where she went into the bedroom after the killing. The transcript relevantly reads:
	


V.3   Rachael was standing here.

V.1   Okay. So where was Rachael? This is when you first came in the room and first watch you saw.

V.3   When I first come in the room Rachael was standing here like, am I allowed to touch it?

V.1   Yeah.

V.3   Rachael was standing here like this, sort of like out of breath and her hair was up and she was going, “Oh, XY, don’t look at the body, don’t look at the body” she said, “don’t look at it” and I was fully standing here like this ….

V.1 was Detective Senior Constable Williams and V.3 was the witness XY.


	
	The Crown relies on that part of the extract in the last excerpt where the witness said “and I was fully standing here like this”. That part of the disc of the walkthrough was played to the Court. It demonstrated that when the witness said “and I was fully standing here like this” she was standing at the foot of the bed in a position where she indicated she was next to Rachael Evans. That is to be contrasted to the evidence she gave in chief that she went only a few steps into the room through the internal door and stood near the cupboard that was positioned near that door.
	
	
	Counsel for the accused opposed leave being given in respect of the first issue but not in respect of the second. Although a viewing of the extract of the disc of the walkthrough suggests to me that the statement relied upon was somewhat equivocal, it was capable of being interpreted as the witness saying that she was standing at the foot of the bed next to Rachael Evans after she entered the room following the killing. If that is the correct reading of her statement there is a clear inconsistency with her evidence in chief and leave should be granted.
	
	
	In relation to the first issue counsel for the accused submitted, first, that the Crown did not open the case to the jury on the basis that the witness was in the room during the killing. Further, he submitted that the Crown was endeavouring to pick and choose which of the witnesses’ various accounts was accepted by the Crown. Finally, he submitted that he intended to cross-examine the witness to suggest that she was in the room at the time of the killing and that if the Crown was entitled to do so it would remove a forensic advantage that the accused had.
	
	
	It is true that the Crown did not open the case to the jury on the basis that this witness was in the room at the time of the killing. Putting aside whether there was any obligation to do so when nothing could be made of the point against the present accused, the Crown was faced with the not unusual situation that it had conflicting evidence from witnesses it was bound to call. The three most significant witnesses are the co-offender Rachael Evans, Scott Derbridge and the present witness XY who were all criminally involved in the events concerned. The Crown had an obligation to lead evidence from the present witness knowing that on this issue it would conflict with the evidence of the other two witnesses. If the Crown did not at least put to this witness that she was present in the room at the time of the killing the Crown would not be in the position to suggest to the jury that they should accept the evidence of Rachael Evans and Scott Derbridge to that effect. In that way, the evidence of this witness that she was not in the room was unfavourable to the Crown.
	
	
	In R v Le [2001] NSWSC 174 McClellan J said:
	


[15]   … [I]n my opinion, the word ""unfavourable"" should be given a broad meaning thereby ensuring that in the course of any criminal trial the Court would not be denied evidence as to any relevant issue and would not be denied the opportunity for that evidence to be appropriately tested. Only this approach will allow the jury to have the opportunity of coming to an informed view about whether or not the evidence called by the Crown should be accepted.


	
	In a somewhat similar vein Refshauge J in R v SH [2011] ACTSC 198; (2011) 6 ACTLR 1 having reviewed a number of authorities on the issue of unfavourable evidence:
	


[35]   It seems to me, however, that these issues really go to the exercise of the discretion to grant leave rather than to the meaning of “unfavourable”. While it may be correct to say that the Crown is to pursue the truth wherever it might lead … the Crown, having laid certain charges, should be able to test the evidence that is inconsistent with those charges. …


	
	In cases such as the present where inconsistent evidence is given by Crown witnesses it is not so much a matter of the Crown picking and choosing as being able to present a coherent account of events based on the evidence that has been given. That may mean inviting the jury to prefer the evidence given by one or more witnesses as opposed to evidence given by another witness.
	
	
	Counsel for the accused was not able to point to any specific forensic disadvantage that would be suffered by the accused if he could not first put to the witness that she had been present in the room at the time of the killing. His only concern was how the questions about the matter would be framed. He is free to press the issue with as much vigour as he chooses, and that is likely to be more vigorous than questions put by the Crown which would simply suggest that the event happened in a particular way. There is no forensic disadvantage from the Crown asking the questions first.
	
	
	In my opinion the witness’s evidence is unfavourable to the Crown and leave ought to be given to the Crown to cross-examine about it.

		25 May 2015",2015-04-29 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2703526,Aslan v R [2015] NSWDC 185,"Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: This is an appeal against two convictions recorded by Mr W Pierce LCM sitting in the Local Court at Burwood on 21 November 2014. The appellant was charged with two offences contrary to s 53 of the Crimes Act 1900. Section 53 is one of the original provisions of that Act and appears never to have been amended. It is in the following terms:
	


“Whosoever, being at the time on horseback, or in charge of any carriage or other vehicle, by wanton or furious riding, or driving, or racing, or other misconduct, or by wilful neglect, does or causes to be done to any person any bodily harm, shall be liable to imprisonment for two years.”

This offence is a Table 1 offence under the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 and is to be dealt with in the Local Court unless an election is made for trial on indictment. When the matter is dealt with in the Local Court, the maximum penalty which can be imposed is 12 months’ imprisonment. I shall need in due course to return to the terms of the statute.


	
	The circumstances which gave rise to the charges arise out of a civil dispute between the appellant, Mr Askin Aslan, and one of the two persons who are alleged to have been the victims of the charges, Mr Houssein Bazzi, who is generally referred to as Sam Bazzi. In April 2012, Mr Bazzi purchased a red Mazda RX8 motor vehicle, registered number BLQ 60R. He bought it on eBay for $15,000. Having purchased the car, Mr Bazzi perceived that there was a problem with the car’s engine. He sought out a motor mechanic to repair the vehicle. He selected E Breathe Easy Solutions Pty Ltd trading as The Edge Tune & Race of 51 Crystal Street, Petersham. The appellant is a mechanic employed by that business. It would appear that Mr Bazzi bailed the vehicle to the repairer on or about 20 June 2012. That is the date of a quotation which became exhibit 4 before me. In the description of the work to be performed the following has been inserted:
	


“Remove and rebuild engine and afterwards look at ECU problems that caused engine failure - talked about $8,000 for engine only, but price depends on strip down[.]”

Mr Bazzi agreed with that quotation and signed it. Either on that day or some time shortly thereafter the vehicle must have been bailed to the repairer.


	
	On 22 November 2012 the repairer generated an invoice directed to Mr Bazzi. It billed $14,400.10, that is, the total cost of the repairs carried out by the repairer. In the meantime, Mr Bazzi had paid a “deposit” to the repairer of $5,000. According to Mr Bazzi’s evidence, the repairer demanded an upfront payment in light of the amount of work that needed to be performed on the red motor car, to which I shall hereafter refer merely as “the red car”. When the invoice of 22 November 2012 was raised, it became clear that Mr Bazzi was indebted to the repairer in the sum of $9,400.10.
	
	
	A dispute then arose. According to the appellant’s evidence-in-chief:
	


“He [Mr Bazzi] was willing to give $7,000 and he owed $9,400 because there was $2,400 worth of extra parts on there that his friend, Michael Corti, had believed[,] because he was a parts interpreter[,] he could have gotten it cheaper. I said, ‘Well, you should have done that before we actually went to the bother of getting it and putting in the car which your friend has already agreed to’. They said they were willing to take the car without those extra parts, but they were already here.”


	
	Mr Michael Corti is in fact a spare parts interpreter by occupation and clearly an acquaintance or friend of Mr Bazzi. After this dispute arose there were numerous interactions between the appellant, and Mr Bazzi and Mr Corti. According to Mr Corti there were over some 15 interactions over a period of at least a year. According to Mr Bazzi he visited the repair shop on 10 to 15 occasions.
	
	
	There were then proceedings in the Consumer Trade and Tenancy Tribunal (CTTT) which has now become part of NCAT. Those proceedings were commenced by Mr Bazzi. In those proceedings, the appellant claimed, in addition, $16,000 in storage fees, and the total cost of his claim or counterclaim against Mr Bazzi exceeded the jurisdictional limit of the CTTT. Those proceedings were finalised before the relevant events. The end result of the finalisation of proceedings in the CTTT/NCAT was the commencement of proceedings in the Local Court. However, the evidence is unclear as to whether they were fresh proceedings or merely the transfer of the CTTT proceedings to the Local Court. On the evidence before me, the civil proceedings in the Local Court have not been finalised.
	
	
	On or about 18 or 19 May 2014 (see transcript p 54 line 25), Mr Bazzi received a communication from the City of Canterbury. The communication was under the hand of Maureen Carey, who described herself as the Regulatory Control Administrator of the Council. Her communication bears date 14 May 2014. The communication was addressed to Mr Bazzi because as far as the Council was aware Mr Bazzi was the owner of the red car. The opening paragraph of the communication is this:
	


“We have been advised that you are the Owner of the abandoned/unattended/unregistered motor vehicle as described below and notice is hereby given in accordance with Section 16 of the Impounding Act, 1993 that council intends to impound the subject vehicle.”

The next paragraph states the vehicle had been abandoned and was considered a danger to the public. The communication required Mr Bazzi to remove the vehicle from its then location by 25 May 2014 and to dispose of it in a proper manner and not to relocate it elsewhere in a public place. The Council went on to advise that, if that did not occur, the vehicle would be taken away for disposal or destruction and that Mr Bazzi will be liable to a fine of $550.


	
	The vehicle was described as being located outside 15 Shaw Avenue, Earlwood. Living at 13 Shaw Avenue, Earlwood was the former wife of the appellant, Ms Birben Aslan. She was living there with her two children, who are also the children of the appellant. Their children were then aged two and three. By “then” I mean at the relevant time. There was no communication between Mr Bazzi and Mr Aslan about the notice that he received from the Council.
	
	
	Mr Bazzi arranged for a tow truck to collect the vehicle on the date the offences are alleged to have occurred, 23 May 2014. He arranged for a tow truck to attend Shaw Avenue and to take the car and to tow it to some place that the evidence does not disclose. The first tow truck operator who arrived there was named Darren. When he arrived in Shaw Avenue and approached the red car a lady, who undoubtedly was the appellant’s former wife, remonstrated with Darren that he had no permission or authority to tow the vehicle away. It is clear from Ms Aslan’s evidence that he was polite to her and acceded to her direction not to remove the vehicle. He left and it is clear that he spoke to his employer, and there was probably further communication between the owner of the tow truck business and Mr Bazzi. According to Mr Bazzi’s evidence Darren had told him he was unable to tow the red car and he, Mr Bazzi, rang the owner of the tow truck business and arranged for another tow truck operator to attend Shaw Avenue and pointed out that Mr Bazzi was going to go down to where the red car was, no doubt, to sort out the dispute between the lady and the tow truck business.
	
	
	Mr Bazzi went to Shaw Avenue in the company of Michael Corti. They went there in a black Mazda 3 motor vehicle, registered number 84ZZI, I shall refer to this vehicle merely as the black car. Ms Aslan said that the red car had been at or outside her premises for “a few months”. She said that the car was parked “there” meaning, I infer, on the street and she was keeping watch over it because it was parked in her street and her former husband had asked her to keep an eye on it.
	
	
	Ms Aslan gave the following evidence as to what occurred after Darren had departed:
	


“Q. So what happened then?

A. I sat at the front of the house just to keep an eye on the street, just to make [sure] no one else coming into the street anyone else coming to try and take the car. So I sat there for about maybe five to ten minutes before I noticed a black car turning right into the end of my street and they were turning really slowly. It was a really sharp turn and they parked right at the end of the street and that caught my attention because I thought it was a little bit odd, the way they were driving.

Q. Do you recall what type of vehicle that was?

A. It was a black car which later on when it moved up I realised it was a black Mazda with black number plates and red writing.

Q. Yes, what happened then?

A. I started getting a little bit worried. I could see two figures in the car, I couldn’t make out exactly who they were. The car sat there for a little while and after about five to ten minutes it slowly drove up. There was no other cars parked along that side of the street and it slowly drove up and stopped right behind the red Mazda. That’s when I realised that these - the gentlemen in the car were here for the car.

Q. Well, if you just tell us what you saw, saw, heard and said?

A. Okay, so they were sitting in the car and I walked up with my phone just to take - walked along the footpath just to take a few snaps because I thought just so I’ve got evidence on who these two men were [,] trying to steal the car.”

What may have caused Ms Aslan to believe that the two men in the black car were going to “steal the car” is a matter of inference. She went on to give evidence about the occupants of the black car:

“They were mouthing things. I couldn’t really hear exactly what they were saying and they were just staring at me and giving me death stares and I felt quite intimidated and scared at that point because I was on my own and my neighbour didn’t want to know about it and wasn’t willing to stick around and help me. Shortly after that I think at that point I contacted Askin and I said, ‘Askin, there’s a car here with two men in the car’. I said, ‘I’m really scared’. I think at that point he said, ‘It must be the owner of the car’. He said, ‘I’m not far, I’ll be here shortly’. Within a few minutes Askin arrived. He got dropped off by a friend or someone and then walked up to the car.”

By the last noun Ms Aslan was referring to the black car.


	
	There was then an ongoing interchange between the appellant and Mr Bazzi and Mr Corti, some of which was overheard by Ms Aslan and some of which has been recorded on moving film taken on Mr Corti’s camera. It is abundantly clear that the appellant believed that Mr Bazzi and Mr Corti had come in order to have a tow truck tow the vehicle out of Shaw Avenue to some destination intended by Mr Bazzi and that the appellant believed that they were doing so in order to defeat his repairer’s lien over vehicle. That lien is properly described as a “possessory lien” although Ms Aslan described it as an “accessory lien” and the word “lien” is sometimes misspelt.
	
	
	There was ill will between the appellant and Mr Bazzi and Mr Corti. Mr Bazzi and Mr Corti could not move the red car. There was only one set of keys to that car and those keys were held by the appellant. The appellant had affixed to the gearshift of the red car what I would refer to as a gearshift lock but is referred to in the evidence as a “club lock”. There is no suggestion that a key to the club lock was given at any time to Mr Bazzi and Mr Corti. Accordingly, the only way that the vehicle could be moved by Mr Bazzi and Mr Corti was if they broke into the vehicle, broke the club lock and hotwired the car or if they had arranged for another tow truck to arrive to tow the vehicle, which is, indeed, what Mr Bazzi had intended.
	
	
	The vehicle was in no imminent danger of being removed from outside 15 Shaw Avenue, Earlwood until a tow truck arrived. If another tow truck did arrive the appellant could have explained his position to the tow truck driver as being the repairer of the vehicle exercising a possessory lien over the vehicle since his cost of repairing the vehicle had been unpaid.
	
	
	I leave to one side the propriety of a repairer of a vehicle claiming the expenses of storing a vehicle over which he was exercising a possessory lien without any contractual right to do so and also the propriety of storing a vehicle in the possession of the repairer outside the house, on a public street, of the former wife of an employee of the repairer. One could be forgiven for thinking that storing the red car in such circumstances was beyond the authorisation implied by law to keep possession of the vehicle prior to releasing it when the repairer’s bill was paid, and quite inconsistent with the rights of the lawful owner.
	
	
	Fortunately, the relevant acts or most of them have been recorded on film taken on Mr Corti’s phone, which was exhibit 3 before the Local Court and is exhibited before me. When Mr Corti’s phone was interrogated by the police, the police downloaded six film clips. They are numbered 883, 884, 885, 889, 890 and 891. The first five of those six video footages are very short, a matter of a few seconds each. However number 891 rolls for about 25 minutes. Clearly when the phone was interrogated the films which would have been numbered by the phone itself as 886, 887 and 888 were missing. It is quite inconceivable that they were taken of some matter other than the interaction between the appellant and Messrs Bazzi and Corti. The inference is clear that they were deleted and the person by who they were deleted could only have been Mr Corti. Why they were deleted the evidence does not disclose but an inference can be drawn that they may have displayed conduct which Mr Corti and or Mr Bazzi could have regretted or been ashamed of.
	
	
	I take narrative events from evidence given by the appellant. In his evidence-in-chief he said this:
	


“A. On the 23rd when I got there I just went up to my ex first of all just to say, “look I know who these guys are”. Then - it was either one or the other. I either went one way or the other but I basically approached them in the car and I explained to them that:

“We have a possessory lien over the vehicle. Like you know the Court date is set, take it to Court, your got all your paperwork, you’ve tried to steal it before from the workshop, you’re trying to steal it again now.”

They’re like, “Have you got the rego papers, it’s not your car”. You know there was a verbal exchange there. I just said, “Look, you’ve got a lawyer, you’ve got a Court date, you’ve got your paperwork and I’ll see you in Court, I’ll see you there.”

Q. So there were three people standing around the car?A. At that point I was at the car. There was the two, Sam and his friend Michael, they were both in the car. My ex was hovering around the situation but I wasn’t really focussed on what on where she was and also one of the neighbours was out the front, our actual next door neighbour, I noticed him as well.

Q. So you had a verbal altercation with these people?

A. Yeah, it was. I don’t know if it was an altercation, I was just pressing my position. He put his finger up at me.

Q. Were there any threats made to you?

A. At that stage did he threaten me? Probably not, probably not at that stage.”

The magistrate then took a short adjournment. The evidence then continued thus:

“Q. Do you recall sitting in the red Mazda?

A. Do I recall sitting?

Q. Recall sitting in the red Mazda?   

A. Yes.

Q. Do you recall Mr Bazzi and Mr Corti standing outside the red Mazda?

A. Yes I do.

Q. And what do you recall them saying anything, threatening or intimidating to you at that point?A. Definitely. Mr...

Q. Could you just speak up a bit?

A. Sorry, Mr Bazzi at that point - just before he sat on the car then he’s like, “What are you going to do about it pussy, what are you going to do about it shit head?” And when he came up to the car he goes, “You’re fucked now cunt. We’re going to fuck you up now cunt”. Like I think he felt he can understood that I was scared at that point and then he said that he came inside and he flicked… he flicked my head, he flicked it.

Q. He physically touched you?

A. Yes. He definitely touched me, like he hit me and then my ex walks up and goes, “Hey you know, what are you doing?” She saw it. And he stomped his foot at her and he swung his arm, went like that and then he, at the same point he opened up the back door and goes, “Look how dirty my car is you shit cunt” and he just spat at me at that point as well. And then I’m like, “You’ve got the paper”, I just kept saying the same thing, I didn’t know what to say because I just kept repeating myself like it wasn’t getting through to him, “You’ve got the paperwork, you’ve got the, you’ve got everything, I’m calling the cops, you know”, …(not transcribable)… you know then Michael walking around, “We’ve been waiting for too long you cunt, waiting two years dickhead”, you know…”

The appellant then went on to say that he felt threatened, more than threatened, he felt afraid.


	
	That description omits certain matters. Prior to getting into the red car the appellant had retrieved a bag, opened the car, popped the bonnet and performed some procedure at the front of the car which was clearly designed to either charge the battery or put the battery into operation. Having completed that, the appellant then lowered the bonnet of the vehicle and entered the vehicle and removed the club lock. It is clear that he placed the key into the ignition of the vehicle. Everything points to the appellant’s attempting to drive off in the vehicle, to remove it from the vicinity of Messrs Bazzi and Corti.
	
	
	It appears to be common ground that Mr Bazzi opened the rear driver’s side door of the red car to inspect it to ascertain its cleanlines. He reached into the vehicle momentarily. That is when the appellant says that his head was flicked. It is shown on the video. The action of Mr Bazzi was extremely brief. He may or may not have touched or flicked the back of the appellant’s head. There is no suggestion that the appellant received any hurt, injury, no suggestion of even any transient, momentary pain. If there was such contact between Mr Bazzi’s hand and the back of the appellant’s head it could only have been cursory and could well have been accidental. It was a trifling event. Although both the appellant and his wife gave evidence of the spitting, nothing of that nature can be seen on the video film and there is no suggestion that it was on any of the three video clips that were deleted. Mr Aslan says it occurred at the same time or shortly immediately after the flicking of his head.
	
	
	Both the appellant’s actions and the video film clearly indicate that the appellant wished to put the vehicle into motion and drive it away so that it could not be towed by a tow truck which had yet to arrive. The appellant’s former wife then entered a vehicle parked in front of the red car and moved it forward. She said she moved it forward in order to put it closer to her front door and she wished to do that in order that she and her two children could get into the car which she had moved and leave the scene, because she feared for the safety of herself and her two children. Equally, it appears to have been a procedure that could have been designed to promote the easy driving of the red car from its parked position onto the driving lane of Shaw Avenue. It could be seen as a procedure that would have expedited the appellant’s driving off in the red car.
	
	
	It is abundantly clear that Messrs Corti and Bazzi both believed that the appellant was about to drive off. By that stage the engine of the vehicle was running, it had been running since the interaction of the appellant and Mr Bazzi on the driver’s side of the vehicle when Mr Bazzi opened the rear driver’s side door. Perceiving that the appellant was about to drive off in the red car, Mr Corti and Mr Bazzi both left the black car and its immediate environs and went to the front of the red car and rested their buttocks on the front of the bonnet of the red car with their feet on the ground. Put in blunt terms, they sat on the bonnet of the car. It is clear they did so to prevent the appellant’s driving away. However, drive away the appellant did. Mr Corti gave this evidence:
	


“A. When Sam had come around the front and met me[,] next to me I then completely stood up instead of leaning on the vehicle. Then I looked at Sam and all of a sudden we were pushed back onto the bonnet and I felt the bumper bar of the RX8 push against the back of my knees which linked [sic] me falling onto the bonnet and seeing Sam fall onto the bonnet as well. The vehicle had taken off. I remember hearing screeching tyres.

Q. Screeching tyres?

A. Yes.

Q. From which car?

A. From the RX8.

Q. What happened?

A. We had then been moving forward, veering out to the right to the middle of the road with us still on the bonnet of the RX8 approximately 10 metres possibly. I had slid over to the left hand side of the bonnet leaning onto the side guard from which I realised was a view to the right of the vehicle. As I sort of roared off I tried to grab something and grabbed the windscreen wiper. I then rolled to the left. I fell onto the ground and kept running. I then looked forward and saw the vehicle continue up the street.

Q. Where was Sam at the time?

A. Sam was still on the bonnet. I then started to run to try to chase the car. I screamed, “Stop.” Sam tried to get off and then I saw the car, the back end of the car swerve to the right but the front was to the left and Sam had slipped off onto the bonnet towards the right with his legs up in the air and his lower back hitting the road first.”

Mr Corti, the correct title of whose occupation was “automotive parts interpreter”, estimated that the speed of the vehicle when he came off the bonnet was between 20 to 30 kilometres per hour and that the at the time that Mr Bazzi left the bonnet of the red car is speed was about 70 kilometres per hour.


	
	Many criticisms were made by the appellant in his submissions to me about the credibility of both Messrs Bazzi and Corti, in particular their insistence that they were standing at the front of the red car when the red car was put into motion, but such criticism, to me, is of little moment. They clearly had their buttocks on the front of the bonnet and their feet on the ground when the car took off, that can be seen in the video film. If there be any issue as to credibility I must be guided not by mere inconsistencies in the evidence, but also the view formed by the learned magistrate, as to the reliability of the witnesses. The learned magistrate clearly had doubts about the reliability of the appellant and his former wife. He said in his very brief reasons this:
	


“I do not find that the RX8 towards the end when Mr Bazzi came off, actually stopped in an extreme hurry, putting an emphasis on the adjective or adverb extreme, I think it was not accurate to describe it as a gentle stopping as both the defendant and his ex-wife said, it was something in the middle but he’d taken off rather quickly, quite quickly.”

Later on the learned magistrate said this,

“I am prepared to accept that there may have been a flick on his [the appellant’s] head, but I am uncertain about the spitting, so I will not make any decision about that.”

He was prepared to accept as a possibility that there may have been a flicking of the appellant’s head but was not even prepared to make such a minor finding in favour of the appellant and his wife of their descriptions of Mr Bazzi spitting at the appellant. In other words, the only evidence as to credibility is against the appellant and his wife, not against Mr Bazzi and Mr Corti. However much criticism can be levelled at them at the type of conduct in which they engaged.


	
	In the defence case, evidence was adduced from an expert that it is possible for the audio on a video clip to be unsynchronised with the visual recording itself and for a visual recording to be speeded up, albeit that the audio recording is not. Submissions were put to me on the first day of this hearing when the appellant was represented by Mr Becker that the video film of the relevant event may have been increased in speed. I reject that submission. The video film of the last 25 minutes, the file numbered 891, records a normal speed of voice, a normal speed of walking, a normal speed of talking. There is absolutely nothing to suggest that the speed of it has been increased. If it were increased, it could have only been to some very minor extent. Nevertheless, I played the relevant part of the film at half speed and it still shows the red car taking off at speed with screeching tyres and a puff of smoke, and then being driven at a very fast pace.
	
	
	The video clearly shows the brake lights of the red car being applied momentarily, at which time Mr Corti, who was on the left-hand side of the bonnet, came off the vehicle, landing on one of his legs, I believe it to have been his left leg, and then the car veered to its right, increasing speed, and then was jerked to the left, causing - I make that finding deliberately - Mr Bazzi to be thrown off the bonnet of the car, landing on his back on the carriageway of Shaw Avenue. One could be forgiven for thinking from watching the video itself that the braking of the car momentarily was designed to throw Mr Corti off the bonnet of the vehicle, and the swerving of the vehicle further on was designed to thrown Mr Bazzi off the bonnet of the vehicle. However, it is not necessary to make such findings.
	
	
	The learned magistrate said this:
	


“There can in my view be no doubt that the driving was furious or wanton, specifically one might say furious. That is not because it was enormously high speed or something like that, which many are, but because almost any speed is pretty dangerous when you have people sitting on the bonnet.”


	
	His Honour then made the remarks about the red car stopping that I have earlier quoted in which he said that it was not accurate to describe it as a gentle stopping. He then refers to the speed of the vehicle as being in mid‑range and pointing out that he had taken off “quite quickly.” He then said this,
	


“There was a blowing of dust and a roar of the engine and off it went. Corti was lucky to get off as he did without injuring himself any more than he did, and plainly he did injure himself when he landed on the pavement. That is the only reasonable inference.”

By the word “pavement”, I infer the learned magistrate was referring to the bitumen of the carriageway rather than the footpath, pavement being a word used by many to describe either a footpath or a footway.


	
	The appellant admitted today that his driving was dangerous. He accepts that it was dangerous to drive off with two people sitting on the bonnet of the car. However, he submitted that his driving was not furious.
	
	
	In the Local Court a defence of self-defence was raised, but the learned magistrate held that the prosecution had successfully negatived beyond reasonable doubt any notion of self-defence or defence of the vehicle. However, having said that, he did not give any reasons for making those findings.
	
	
	Yesterday the appellant, who determined the retainer of his solicitor, submitted that he was entitled to raise the defences of necessity or duress. The argument advanced is that when Messrs Bazzi and Corti got out of the black car and came up to the red car and there was interaction between Mr Bazzi and the appellant on the driver’s side of the vehicle, and Mr Corti went round the left side of the vehicle before sitting on the bonnet, he was put in fear of death or grievous bodily harm. That there were insults and the use of foul language is patently clear. That there were claims and counter-claims is basically clear. For example, the appellant at no time indicated to Mr Bazzi that he was exercising a possessory lien but rather protested that he was the owner of the vehicle. Such a protest made to the true owner of the vehicle would, one would expect, be met with derision. It was. Clearly there was bad blood between the three men. However, there was no attempt at punching, no attempt to restrain the appellant, no attempt to pull him out of the car, no attempt to grab the keys of the vehicle out of the car, nothing of the nature which indicated that some oral threat might be put into action. The appellant says that he was put in fear of his life or wellbeing and the life or wellbeing of his former wife and children by the conduct of the alleged victims, Mr Bazzi and Mr Corti. That their conduct was loutish and boorish is beyond question. However robust their interchanges were with the appellant, there is nothing to suggest that they would put any oral threats into action.
	
	
	At the commencement of the cross-examination of the appellant by the prosecutor, the following evidence was given.
	


“Q. So at the [CTTT] you reckon that Michael was Mr Bazzi’s muscle man?

A. Well that’s what I called him.

Q. That’s what you called him or did he introduce himself as a muscle man? All right, did Mr Bazzi introduce you to Michael as the muscle man, yes or no?

A. No.

Q. So it’s more - it’s what you think in your head, is that what you think in your head?

A. Well no - I’ve got reasons for thinking that way.

Q. What’s the reason?

A. The reason I think that way because he was always - like Sam wouldn’t do anything, and Mike was like the muscle guy, he’d do all the swearing, he’d do all the intimidation, he’s the one that was sent to steal the car, he’s the one who had the argument in the shop. Every time there’s a problem Sam brings Michael along. Every situation, doesn’t come by himself, he comes with Michael and then Michael does all the rough work and I just - I always used to tell my boss, he’s come with the muscle man again, you know, trying to intimidate us.

Q. So it snowballed then, you thought that he may be a muscle man?

A. Sorry?

Q. It’s not confirmed?

A. Well he didn’t tell me, he didn’t say this is my muscle man.

Q. So - but anyhow, because of the incident at the tribunal you have concerns for them - you have concern of your safety if you see them again?

A. He was threatening but I didn’t know how far this guy was going to go.

Q. After the day at the tribunal you [are] scared of them?

A. I thought he was putting on a bit of an act...”

The appellant then admitted that he was not scared of them at the CTTT. He went on to say that he only became scared of them when they got out of the black car and approached him when he was sitting in the red car.


	
	If one accepts what Ms Aslan said, the appellant believed when she told him of the arrival of two men in the black car, pulling in behind the red car, that they were Mr Bazzi and probably Mr Corti. The appellant would realise that as soon as he arrived in Shaw Avenue and saw them in the black car. He does not appear to have been frightened of them at that time. He then went about the process of putting the car into operation, such that he could drive it away. He persisted with that course of action. He put himself closer to the two men whom he asked me to believe caused him fear for his life and safety. If he had any fears about what they might do when he arrived at Shaw Avenue he could have gone into his former wife’s house, locked the door and called the police. He did not do so. He put himself closer to the two men. If he became scared of them when they got out of the vehicle he could have locked himself within the red car and if they wished to gain access to him they would have been required to do something such as smash the window or windows or windscreen, which one would not expect the true owner of the vehicle to do. There was no attempt by the appellant to flee. Much earlier on, in interaction between the appellant and the two other men, the appellant threatened to call the police and he was encouraged to do so by Messrs Bazzi and Corti. He did not. The appellant asked me to believe that he encouraged his wife to call the police, but her evidence was that she could not make contact with 000, a protestation which is extremely difficult to accept. The evidence does not show any objective basis for the appellant honestly to believe that he feared for his life or safety or indeed for the safety of his former wife and their children. It would have been very easy to have left the red vehicle when Messrs Bazzi and Corti got out of the black vehicle and to run back to his former wife’s home, lock himself within it and dial 000. He did not.
	
	
	True it is that sometimes one does not think clearly when under pressure. However, everything points only to one inevitable, inexorable conclusion, that the appellant was determined to drive the vehicle away to prevent its being towed away by a tow truck driver that may have been engaged by Mr Bazzi in order for him to fulfil his obligation under the notice delivered to him by the Council. In addition, the appellant raised both yesterday and today his right to defend his possessory lien in the vehicle, but his right of possession could not be overridden by Mr Bazzi and Mr Corti because they did not have the key to the vehicle or the key to the club lock. It is highly unlikely that Mr Bazzi would have damaged his own vehicle and there is no suggestion that he ever tried to do so.
	
	
	There is no merit to the suggestion that Mr Corti had previously tried to “steal” the vehicle or otherwise take possession of it or that he misbehaved towards the appellant at the CTTT because such things were never put by the defence to Mr Corti when he gave his evidence. Leaving aside the protestations made by the appellant in his evidence, there is no evidence otherwise of any misconduct by Mr Bazzi and Mr Corti in their numerous interactions with the appellant between June 2012 and May 2014. There was no need for the appellant to drive the vehicle away when he only needed to wait for the tow truck to arrive and to explain his position to the tow truck driver and perhaps retain the tow truck driver himself to tow the vehicle back to the repair shop.
	


Self-defence is governed in this State by s 418 of the Crimes Act 1900. Section 418(2) is in the following terms:

“A person carries out conduct in self-defence if and only if the person believes the conduct is necessary:

   (a) to defend himself or herself or another person, or

   […]

   (c) to protect property from unlawful taking, destruction,

   damage or interference, or

   […]

and the conduct is a reasonable response in the circumstances as he or she perceives them.”

I am not persuaded that the defendant honestly believed it was necessary to do what he did to defend himself.


	
	The appellant may have believed it was necessary to drive the vehicle away to protect the vehicle from being taken by a tow truck driver, but the conduct in which the appellant engaged was not in any way a reasonable response in the circumstances that he perceived at the time. The circumstances are a necessity to defend a property which could only arise when a tow truck driver arrived. The appellant wished to pre-empt that occurring at all. Furthermore, the law values the integrity of a person over the integrity of property. It is a much more serious crime to injure a person than it is to damage property. The moral culpability for injuring a person is much greater than the moral culpability for damaging property. The learned magistrate rightly concluded that the prosecution had negatived any defence of self-defence.
	
	
	During this appeal a number of questions of law arose. The appellant protested that he had not intended to cause harm to either of the victims. That raised for consideration what the mental element or mens rea might be in a offence contrary to s 53 of the Crimes Act 1900. It appeared to me, uninstructed by authority, that the appropriate mens rea was the intention to drive. The prohibited conduct is wanton driving, furious driving, racing, some other misconduct or wilful neglect which causes bodily harm to another. It is the manner of the driving which is a necessary element of the offence, but the various mental states involved in each of the sub-categories is quite different and therefore it appeared to me that the only mental element was the intention to drive. However, guidance on this issue can be gleaned from the more serious offences of dangerous driving causing death or grievous bodily harm, which are provided for in s 52A of the Crimes Act 1900. The offence of dangerous driving replaced the offence of culpable driving which had previously been provided by s 52A.
	
	
	The learning on those offences is that the offence is one of strict liability and the prosecution is not required to prove any mens rea. However the defendant can raise an honest and reasonable mistake as to fact, which once raised by the evidence, the prosecution must negative. The authorities for those propositions are Giorgianni v R (1985) 156 CLR 473, and Jiminez v R (1992) 173 CLR 572.
	
	
	There is the presumption that the driving of an accused person is a voluntary and conscious act. It is not necessary for a judge to direct a jury on that element of the offence unless there is some question of sleep or the influence of alcohol or drugs arising. See, for example, Edwards v Macrae (1991) 14 MVR 193 and R v Dunne (NSWCCA, 1 March 1993, unreported). I approach therefore the proper interpretation of s 53 as being a crime of strict liability.
	
	
	The verbiage of s 53 which I quoted at the commencement of these reasons is that of the late 19th century. The offence was clearly directed to horse-drawn transport. I would have thought that the words “in charge of any carriage or other vehicle”, the word “vehicle” should be construed ejusdem generis with the word “carriage” so that the it would be apt to describe a gig, trap or dray or other horse-pulled contraption. But it is clear that the word “vehicle” is appropriate to describe a self-propelled, that is, automobile, vehicle.
	
	
	The court attendance notices charging the appellant refer to “wanton/furious driving”, being two of the categories of conduct proscribed by s 53. The learned magistrate found both wanton and furious driving. The appellant submits that his driving was not furious, relying upon the dictionary definitions of that word. However, there is some learning on the word “furious” in a similar provision. That learning is Chatterton v Parker (1914) 3LT 381, a decision of the King’s Bench Division of the High Court of England. Relevantly, Darling J said this:
	


“In this case the appellant was convicted for that he did drive a trap furiously on a certain highway so as to endanger the lives and limbs of passengers, and it is now contended on his behalf that the conviction was wrong. It appears from the case stated that the appellant was in a cart, that he was apparently asleep, and that the horse was proceeding along the highway at a furious rate. There is no doubt that the appellant had been driving before he went to sleep, but it is now said that because he was asleep that he was not driving, that in fact no one was driving, and that the horse was left to go on furiously according to its own devices and choice. In my opinion the appellant was driving. There is no contention that he had been seized with illness, and was therefore unable to exercise his will. Again, the trap was proceeding at a furious pace. As I have said the appellant was really driving and therefore he was driving at a furious pace. There is nothing in the statute which makes it necessary that, in order to constitute furious driving, the driver should be actually urging on the horses with a whip or using other means to increase his pace. A horse may be driven furiously if the driver neglects to restrain it and keep it under proper control.

The other point raised on behalf of the appellant is that which refers to the endangering of the life or limb of any passenger. In my view the conviction in the present case might be upheld on the ground that the appellant was himself a passenger, that there was evidence that he endangered his own life and limb.”

The other members of the Court, Avory and Rowlatt JJ agreed with the outcome but not with the reasoning that the appellant in that case was a passenger in the dray of which he was a driver. They joined in the judgment of Darling J because they were of the view that the police constable who detected the furious driving was himself put at risk. According to Avory J the person driving must endanger some other person. Rowlatt J was of the same view. Avory J said this:

“The section means that a person is guilty of an offence if he drives furiously in such a manner as to endanger passengers who may reasonably be expected to be on the highway.”

In other words, furious driving is driving at a pace or speed which causes danger to the life or person of other users of the road.


	
	Driving at any pace other than a walking pace with persons sitting on the bonnet of a car is inherently dangerous, offers those persons the prospect of hurt or injury and therefore can properly be described as furious driving. In any event it appears to me that the conduct of the appellant was wanton. I am aware of a decision of one of my predecessors, Cooper DCJ in R v Bolton (unreported 14 May 1981) in which his Honour held that the word “wanton” means unrestrained disregard of the consequences of the accused’s action. The original meaning of “wanton” as an adjective, meant undisciplined, ungoverned, unmanageable or rebellious. When used in connection with cruelty or violence, it meant unprovoked or reckless or gratuitous violence. When the adverb “wantonly” is used in respect to “action” it means without regard for right or consequences, recklessly, gratuitously or wilfully. In my view, wanton is apt to describe reckless conduct. Anyone driving a vehicle with persons sitting on the bonnet of a vehicle at any speed, other than a walking pace is, in my view, acting with reckless disregard to the health and safety of those sitting on the vehicle. In my view, the appellant’s actions were clearly wanton. Indeed, the admission that his driving was dangerous really answers that question.
	
	
	The defence of necessity is not open in a case of this nature. According to Stephen, in his Digest of the Criminal Law:
	


“An act which would otherwise be a crime may in some cases be excused if the person accused can show that it was done only in order to avoid consequences which could not otherwise be avoided, and which, if they had followed would have inflicted him or upon others, whom he was bound to protect inevitable and irreparable evil, that no more was done than was reasonably necessary for that purpose, and that the evil inflicted by it was not disproportionate to the evil avoided.”


	
	The extent of that principle was discussed in R v Loughnan (1981) VR 443, where it was established that there were three elements:
	



	
	the act must have been done only to avoid certain consequences which would have inflicted irreparable evil upon the accused or upon those whom he was bound to protect;
	
	
	the accused must honestly believe on reasonable grounds that he is in imminent peril; and
	
	
	the acts done to avoid the imminent peril must not be out of proportion to the peril to be avoided
	


This defence has been applied in a case of speeding, where the driver was taking his gravely ill son to hospital R v White (1987) 9 NSWLR 427. It has also been held, I am aware in lower courts, that it applies to somebody who breaches, for example, drink/driving laws in order to take a woman in labour in imminent birth of delivery of her child to hospital by a motor vehicle, when there is insufficient time for an ambulance to be called.


	
	Here, what was “the irreparable evil”, which the accused sought to avoid? I have already found on the evidence, that there was no reasonable belief that the appellant himself or his ex‑wife or his children, were in danger of suffering death or grievous bodily harm. The only evil which it appears to me the appellant sought to avoid, was the evil of having the car towed away. To suggest that inflicting actual bodily harm on two persons was a lesser evil than having a car towed away is risible, or to use more plain English, laughable.
	
	
	The final defence upon which the appellant relied was duress.
	


MATTER INTERPOSED


	
	APPELLANT: Your Honour, I’d like to make an application if I can?
	


HIS HONOUR: I’m in the middle of giving judgment, you can’t.

APPELLANT: I’d like to make an application to withdraw, your Honour, upon reflection of the Local Court--

HIS HONOUR: You mean what, the appeal?

APPELLANT: Yes.

HIS HONOUR: No, you can only withdraw the appeal with my leave. Why should I grant you leave when I am giving my reasons?

APPELLANT: Your Honour, I just reflected a bit in the break that we had, I was just having a bit of a reflection and I feel like the Local Court judgment is reasonable and I’m willing to accept it.

HIS HONOUR: Sorry?

APPELLANT: I feel like the Local Court judgment, upon reflection, is reasonable and I’m just willing to accept it, your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: It’s only an appeal against conviction at this stage, I haven’t granted you leave to appeal against the sentence so I can’t interfere with the sentence because there’s no appeal before me against the sentence.

APPELLANT: That’s fine, your Honour, I’ll just accept it as it is.

HIS HONOUR: What do you say, Ms Brown? Section 67--

BROWN: It does at any stage--

HIS HONOUR: Yes, but with leave.

BROWN: Yes, with leave--

HIS HONOUR: I am not to bound to grant it, either.

BROWN: No. Your Honour, probably my only concern is that if there was to be another appeal lodged--

HIS HONOUR: What appeal could there be?

BROWN: There couldn’t be but just if Mr Aslan did in the future decide that he wished to repursue it. I’m also wondering under those circumstances whether there’s a provision for the Crown to seek costs. It’s not something I’ve done before but I think it’s really a matter for the Court whether leave is granted at this late stage, bearing in mind that your Honour had almost finished the judgment.

HIS HONOUR: Yes. I mean when one takes care to deliver judgment, Mr Aslan, if these are civil proceedings it wouldn’t be granted leave at all, you can’t seek leave after commencement of judgment.

BROWN: I think, your Honour, upon reflection my position would be that leave not be granted at this late stage.

HIS HONOUR: Part 53 rule 10.

BROWN: It says in the commentary that a court is not bound to give leave to withdraw.

HIS HONOUR: Yes, I know. Yes, under Part 53, r 10(2)(gi), an application for leave to withdraw an appeal under s 67 of the Crimes Act (Local Courts Appeal and Review) Act 2001 is to be made by a notice of motion. I can dispense with that. Since you don’t wish to proceed further. Just for my benefit I am going to outline briefly what I was going to do, all right, Mr Aslan? Do you understand?

APPELLANT: So it’s withdrawn, your Honour?

HIS HONOUR: Sorry?

APPELLANT: So it’s granted? Is it withdrawn?

HIS HONOUR: No. Since you don’t wish to persist with it, I can abbreviate the reasons I’m going to give for the rest of the judgment.

APPELLANT: And will they be recorded, your Honour?

HIS HONOUR: Yes. Why, you don’t want them recorded, is that why you’re making the application?

APPELLANT: Yes, yes, your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Leave to withdraw the appeal is refused, no proper ground has been shown for why it ought be granted. Have a seat, Mr Aslan.


	
	The remaining substantive defence raised by the appellant is one of duress. The appellant referred me to a number of authorities. They included R v Willer (1986) 83 Cr App R 225; R v Conway [1989] 1 QB 290; DPP v Bell [1992] RTR 335; and R v Cairns [1992] 2 Cr App R 137. In R v Conway, Woolf LJ delivered the judgment of the court which comprised him and McCullough and Auld JJ. At 298D his Lordship quoted from the decision of the Lord Chief Justice Lane in R v Graham [1982] 1 WLR 394. What the Chief Justice said there has been approved by the House of Lords in R v Howe [1987] AC 417. His Lordship said this:
	


“As a matter of public policy, it seems to us essential to limit the defence of duress by means of an objective criterion formulated in the terms of reasonableness. Consistency of approach in defences to criminal liability is obviously desirable. Provocation and duress are analogous. In provocation the words or actions of one person break the self-control of another. In duress the words or actions of one person break the will of another. The law requires a defendant to have the self-control reasonably to be expected of the ordinary citizen in his situation. It should likewise require him to have the steadfastness reasonably to be expected of the ordinary citizen in his *459 situation. So too with self-defence, in which the law permits the use of no more force than is reasonable in the circumstances. And, in general, if a mistake is to excuse what would otherwise be criminal, the mistake must be a reasonable one.

It follows that we accept Mr. Sherrard's submission that the direction in this case was too favourable to the appellant. The Crown having conceded that the issue of duress was open to the appellant and was raised on the evidence, the correct approach on the facts of this case would have been as follows. (1) Was the defendant, or may he have been, impelled to act as he did because, as a result of what he reasonably believed King had said or done, he had good cause to fear that if he did not so act King would kill him or (if this is to be added) cause him serious physical injury? (2) If so, have the prosecution made the jury sure that a sober person of reasonable firmness, sharing the characteristics of the defendant, would not have responded to whatever he reasonably believed King said or did by taking part in the killing?”

There is therefore to be seen that there is to be consistency with defences of duress, provocation and self-defence. Each offence requires not only a subjective belief but a reasonable response in the circumstances viewed objectively.


	
	In the current case I am not persuaded, as earlier said, that the appellant honestly believed that he was at risk of death or serious bodily injury, nor did he honestly believe that his wife and children were subject to a threat of death or serious bodily injury. I also cannot accept that the appellant feared that the vehicle would be removed from Shaw Avenue by the action of Messrs Bazzi and Corti. Such a fear could only arise when a tow truck driver arrived and appeared to take directions from Mr Bazzi. That had not yet occurred. There is no reason to believe that the appellant had a genuine fear that any removal of the car was imminent. In any event, fear for the removal of the car does not in any way justify a reaction which caused actual bodily harm to Messrs Bazzi and Corti. The action was quite disproportionate to any fear that the appellant may genuinely have had about the intention of Mr Bazzi to cause the vehicle to be removed from Shaw Avenue. Furthermore duress, by its definition, is a fear produced by threats of death or grievous bodily harm if a certain act is not done, or overbears the actor’s wish not to perform the act and its effect at the time of the act in constraining him to perform it. That was laid down in DPP for North Ireland v Lynch [1975] AC 653 at 686. The authorities make it clear that the threat must be death or grievous bodily harm, or of imprisonment or of violence generally. I am unaware of any case deciding that a threat to property amounts to duress such as to justify committing an act which causes actual bodily harm. The offence of duress in those circumstances is not made out.
	
	
	A submission has been put by the appellant that there was no causation between the injuries sustained by Mr Corti and his coming off the bonnet of the red car, whether one calls it his falling off or jumping off the vehicle. It is clear that when Mr Corti got off the front of the bonnet, he had the momentum of the car behind him. As I have already pointed out, an inference could be drawn that it was a slight temporary braking by the appellant which caused him to come off the bonnet of the car. Leaving that aside, it is clear that he was trying to escape a position of peril and, acting with the momentum of the car, took a number of strides seeking to remain upright, his no doubt being concerned that if he fell onto the carriageway he might be run over. In the process of making those strides Mr Corti may have suffered the injuries which he did, an injury to his left foot which is shown in photographs of his body, which appear to be part of exhibit 5 before the Local Court and are images numbered 6 to 10. The earlier five images are the images of the injuries sustained by Mr Bazzi. The submission put by the appellant is that these injuries were caused not by Mr Corti coming off the bonnet of the vehicle, but rather by his pursuing the appellant as he drove away in the red car. That submission is unsupportable. It is clear that the strides that Mr Corti took after coming off the car were an attempt to keep his balance and to “burn off” momentum of his body caused by the impetus given to him by the red car. It was suggested by the appellant that Mr Corti pursued the red car after he was thrown off it and after Mr Bazzi came off it, and that the appellant had come to a stop some small distance away from Mr Bazzi and that the appellant decamped in the vehicle because of a continuing fear caused by Mr Corti’s continued pursuit.
	
	
	Such is not supported by the video film which clearly shows Mr Corti reacting to coming off the bonnet of the car and then heading towards the red car but when he sees Mr Bazzi on the roadway he goes no further than Mr Bazzi and stops to give him assistance. The suggestion that it was necessary for the appellant to decamp in the vehicle because of a pursuit by Mr Corti is merely fanciful. I accept that Mr Corti’s injuries were caused by his left foot coming into contact with the roadway either initially when he came off the vehicle or in subsequent stepping out when he was trying to maintain his upright position.
	
	
	The final thing I should say is that there was much evidence concerning skid marks. That evidence went nowhere. It was an unnecessary part of the Crown case and like every other issue in the case was pursued by the defence but unnecessarily so. There is no averment by any police officer that the skid marks that they marked out were fresh, that they had only been laid down in the last 10 to 16 minutes or so, that the smell of burnt rubber was still to be made or appreciated or perceived. There is just a reference to skid marks on the roadway and no attempt was made by the Crown to link those skid marks to the red car at all. The issue, as I said, was an unnecessary one and it was not really part of the Crown case to adduce those skid marks other than to raise a further area of concern for the defence.
	
	
	In the circumstances, I am persuaded that the convictions recorded were correctly recorded. For those reason the appeal is dismissed. Any further application?
	


APPELLANT: Yes, your Honour, I would like to make an application for severity, leave to seek - I thought I’d actually made it already.

HIS HONOUR: No, you haven’t.

APPELLANT: Well, I’d like to seek leave so I can get that fixed up.

HIS HONOUR: I’m giving you a Parker warning. I think the penalty was too low. You are going to get a more severe penalty if you persist with an application for leave to appeal against the severity of the sentence. Furthermore, I suspect that you’re concerned about the disqualification period, am I right in that regard?

APPELLANT: Yes, your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Well I think it’s automatic, isn’t it?

BROWN: Yes, your Honour, it’s the minimum. The order made was actually three years.

APPELLANT: Plus the actual money, your Honour, it’s $2,000 per fine and I’ve got no money. I haven’t been paid in the last six weeks and I’m in financial dire straits and I think the fine was quite--

HIS HONOUR: Well you can make an application to the Registrar of the Local Court about that but in my view some form of custodial sentence was warranted and you can’t get around the disqualification period. As Ms Brown has told me, the disqualification is automatic. The automatic disqualification is in fact three years and the magistrate imposed the minimum applicable which is one year, you can’t do anything about that at all.

APPELLANT: What I wanted to apply for, your Honour, is a s 10(1)(b), that’s what I wanted to--

BROWN: Your Honour, technically the severity appeal is out of time and your Honour doesn’t have to grant leave.

HIS HONOUR: Well technically I have to grant leave, yes.

BROWN: No, well, your Honour doesn’t have to grant leave and considering your Honour has indicated because Mr Aslan is self-represented and your Honour’s indicated that you’re likely to impose a heavier sentence it may be your Honour refuses leave.

HIS HONOUR: That’s right, leave is necessary because in the notice of appeal it doesn’t say this is an appeal against severity of the sentence. The appellant has indicated that he wishes now to pursue an appeal against severity of the sentence, although the notice of appeal appeals only against the conviction. In the circumstances the appellant seeks leave to agitate an appeal against severity of the sentence. I have indicated to the appellant that if he persists with that application I must give him a Parker warning. In my view some form of custodial sentence ought to have been considered by the Local Court. That was not done. The appellant was fined and disqualified from driving for the minimum period applicable. Nothing that I can do other than give the appellant the benefit of s 10 would obviate the conviction. This, considering what I have said about giving the appellant a Parker warning, would be an otiose exercise. Leave to appeal against the severity of sentence is accordingly refused.

BROWN: And, your Honour, that’s an appeal requiring leave under s 12(3).

HIS HONOUR: Yes, we all know that.

BROWN: Yes, just for the purpose of the record.

		28 August 2015",2015-04-29 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2703527,R v Duffy (No. 4) [2015] NSWSC 493,"Judgment


	
	The Crown applies under s 38 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) to cross-examine the witness and co-offender Rachael Evans on the basis that evidence that she has given in-chief is unfavourable evidence. There are seven discrete areas in respect of which cross-examination is sought.
	
	
	The first area relates to the issue of the belt used to kill the deceased. The evidence from Ms Evans was that the belt was on the end of the bed at the time she went into the bedroom with the witness XY intending at that stage to ""smash"" Colleen. She said that when she was in that bedroom at an earlier time that evening talking to Colleen the belt was not there. Her evidence that the belt was in the room when she entered it with the witness XY conflicts with the evidence that was given by the witness XY who said that when they were sitting in the lounge room of the guesthouse Rachael Evans went elsewhere and came back with the belt. XY said that Ms Evans sat with the belt in the living room playing with it and muttering to herself. It was that belt, according to the witness XY, that was taken into the bedroom by Rachael Evans.
	
	
	The other evidence said to be inconsistent with Rachael Evans' evidence is the evidence of Mrs Green who said that there was no belt in the bedroom of the guesthouse when she and her husband left to go on holidays. The significance of that evidence for the present application is considerably weakened, however, by the fact that Rachael Evans herself says that the belt was not there earlier in the evening of the killing.
	
	
	The second area relates to the injury that Rachael Evans says was caused to the deceased's head by XY hitting her on the forehead with a bottle. She says that when that happened the deceased’s forehead was split in a way that caused it to bleed. That evidence is inconsistent with the evidence given by the witness XY who said that she was not even in the room at the time, let alone did not hit the deceased with the bottle. It is also, more significantly, inconsistent with the evidence of the forensic pathologist who said that there was nothing on the forehead of the deceased's body which would indicate that there was a laceration or an injury of the type described by Rachael Evans.
	
	
	The third area of evidence relates to who collected the sheets from the bedroom where the deceased was killed. The evidence of Rachael Evans was that the witness XY collected the sheets some little time after the killing when at least Rachael Evans had taken the deceased's body to the shower and was washing it. That evidence is to be contrasted with the evidence of the witness XY who said that after she was effectively told to get out of the bedroom after the killing, she went and stood on the balcony and soon after the sheets were thrown over the balcony past her from the bedroom by Rachael Evans.
	
	
	The fourth area concerns the conversation Mr Derbridge reported at the park at Campbelltown which is recorded at page 261 of the transcript. This was his evidence that had initially been provided in his final ERISP where he said that at the park Rachael Evans had said she wanted to kill Colleen, that the witness XY had said something similar and when Mr Derbridge was asked about Mr Duffy, he said, ""He was in on it too"" and said, ""He [ie Duffy] went, 'Yeah, we will, we will and, yeah, they killed her'"". The evidence given by Rachael Evans in-chief was that there was no conversation at the park about wanting to kill Colleen.
	
	
	The fifth area concerns evidence given by Mr Derbridge (at T 204) that he and the witness XY were lying down in the second bedroom in the guesthouse when Rachael Evans came into the room and said they were going to kill her now. Rachael Evans gives no such evidence and denies having said anything of the sort. I will return to the detail of what was said presently.
	
	
	The evidence from the witness XY was unclear about whether she was ever in that bedroom, although she seemed to accept, on balance, that it is possible that she was in that bedroom at some stage lying down. However, she did not give evidence consistent with Mr Derbridge's evidence in that regard.
	
	
	The sixth area which the Crown seeks simply to ask Ms Evans, rather than to put it as a positive proposition to her, is that shortly before she went into the bedroom when the deceased was killed, she was sitting in the lounge saying, ""I'm going to do it, I'm not going to do it"" and was debating with herself in a low voice. That was the evidence of the witness XY.
	
	
	Finally, the Crown wishes to cross-examine Ms Evans concerning her motive for having killed the deceased. Her evidence-in-chief was that she did not know why she had killed her. The Crown wishes to put to her that a motive for the killing was jealousy arising from Ms Evans’ past relationship with Mr Duffy. There was evidence that the deceased was interested in Mr Duffy and they had had sex during the course of that evening.
	
	
	The application is opposed by Mr Trevallion of counsel for the accused. He says that the evidence affects only the credibility of the witness and does not amount to unfavourable evidence within the meaning of s 38 of the Act for that reason alone. He particularly opposes cross-examination relating to the fifth area concerning Mr Derbridge’s evidence of what Ms Evans said before the killing.
	
	
	Earlier in the trial an application was made by the Crown under s 38 to cross-examine the witness XY. In my reasons for judgment in permitting that cross-examination, I drew attention to a passage in the judgment of McClellan CJ at CL in R v Le (2001) NSWSC 174 at [15] and a passage in the judgment of R v SH [2011] ACTSC 198; (2011) 6 ACTLR 1 at [35] by Refshauge J. In that judgment I considered that those statements of principle justified the leave to the Crown to cross-examine that witness.
	
	
	It seems to me that there is nothing different in principle from what is being sought in the present case. This is one of a number of Crown witnesses who were present at or about the time of the killing. The evidence of this witness is not on all-fours with the other two significant witnesses, that is, the witness XY and the witness Scott Derbridge. Further, the evidence of the witness Rachael Evans in relation to the injury said to have been caused by being struck by the witness XY is inconsistent with the expert opinion of the forensic pathologist. Nevertheless, the Crown was obliged to lead this evidence as part of its responsibility in properly prosecuting the case.
	
	
	In that sense it seems to me that the evidence in the seven categories that have been identified is unfavourable evidence within the meaning of s 38. No particular prejudice or disadvantage has been pointed to by the accused if the Crown was permitted to cross-examine this witness under s 38 except in relation to the fifth matter. To understand the prejudice alleged it is necessary to set out what appears in the transcript at that point of Mr Derbridge’s evidence.
	
	
	The transcript originally read:
	


Q. What happened then?

A. Rachael ‑ after me and Monique went to sleep Rachael came in, woke us up, saying that, ""They're going to kill Colleen now"".

Subsequently counsel agreed that the evidence of Mr Derbridge involved the use of indirect speech and that the transcript should read:

A. Rachael ‑ after me and Monique went to sleep Rachael came in, woke us up, saying that they're going to kill Colleen now.


	
	Significantly, no objection was taken by Counsel for the Accused to the evidence being given in that form, that is, by the use of indirect speech. Nor was Mr Derbridge cross-examined in attempt to show that what was said by Ms Evans was “We’re going to kill Colleen now”. However, Mr Trevallion, in opposing the s 38 application in relation to this evidence, submitted that it was never made clear by Mr Derbridge whether he was suggesting that Ms Evans was saying “We’re” meaning Ms Evans and perhaps some other person unnamed, or “They’re” which would necessarily exclude her but likely include the accused. If the latter was meant the statement was hearsay and should not be allowed.
	
	
	The use of the term “We’re” was significantly different because it was Ms Evans’ evidence that it was XY who wanted to “smash” the deceased and had asked for Ms Evans’ assistance in that regard. If prejudice arose to Mr Duffy by questions asked about this matter it arose when Mr Derbridge gave his evidence and no objection was taken to it. However, when I sought clarification from the Crown about what precise question she intended to put to Ms Evans concerning Mr Derbridge’s evidence, she said that she intended to put that Ms Evans came into the room and said “We’re going to kill Colleen now”. She was not going to put that Ms Evans said “They’re going to kill Colleen now”.
	
	
	In those circumstances, not only would cross-examination about that matter not be prejudicial to Mr Duffy but the question to be put would clarify Mr Derbridge’s ambiguous evidence in favour of the accused. There is, therefore, no forensic disadvantage nor unfair prejudice to the accused by granting leave under s 38 on this part of the evidence.
	
	
	Otherwise, I regard the evidence in the other areas as unfavourable evidence. For those reasons, leave is granted.

		25 May 2015",2015-04-29 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2703543,R v Farrell [2015] NSWCCA 68,"Judgment


	
	SIMPSON J: I agree with Bellew J.
	
	
	ROTHMAN J: I have had the benefit of the reasons for judgment of Bellew J and his thorough analysis of the issues. I agree with his conclusion that the appeal should be dismissed, but I do so on a different basis.
	
	
	The offence with which the respondent was charged is the possession of an unauthorised pistol, the maximum sentence for which is 14 years’ imprisonment, with a standard non-parole period of 3 years. Each is a guidepost to the sentence to be imposed. There are other guideposts and factors to which Bellew J has referred.
	
	
	This pistol has been described. While it is possible to imagine a more dangerous weapon, it is very difficult to imagine a more dangerous pistol.
	
	
	A canon, for example, would be a more dangerous weapon. The ability to imagine a more dangerous weapon does not detract from the characterisation of the pistol as in the worst category. Its possession was not “wholly innocent” in that, as is required by the offence, the respondent was aware of its existence. Further, the respondent had handled the weapon. The sentencing judge took into account that there was no evidence to suggest possession for an intended criminal purpose to be executed by (by either himself or others) or that he discharged the pistol (or allowed its discharge by others). At the same time, there was no evidence to the opposite effect.
	
	
	If the respondent had discharged the pistol or been complicit in its discharge, a different and more serious offence would have been committed. I do not accept that the lack of evidence of the commission of a more serious offence is an ameliorating factor in this offence. Evidence that positively establishes it had not been and was not the respondent’s intention to discharge the weapon or to use it in a criminal enterprise may be ameliorative in that it proves an innocent purpose.
	
	
	Nevertheless, the pistol is an extremely dangerous weapon and the legislature has understandably treated the possession of such weapons as, of itself, serious, whether or not it is presently intended to be used for another criminal offence. It certainly had the potential to be so used.
	
	
	The Crown relies on manifest inadequacy. It is traditional or conventional to rely on that ground because of the manner in which the provisions of s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 have been understood to apply: see Cranssen v The Queen [1936] HCA 42; (1936) 55 CLR 509 at 519-201; Carroll v The Queen [2009] HCA 13; (2009) 83 ALJR 579 at [6]-[8]. In order to persuade the Court of that ground, the Crown must establish to the Court’s satisfaction that the sentence was unreasonable or plainly unjust: Carroll v The Queen, ibid; Dinsdale v The Queen [2000] HCA 54; (2000) 202 CLR 321.
	
	
	Even allowing for the respondent having served 9 ½ months on remand, a sentence of 2 years imprisonment is, in my view, unreasonably inadequate and plainly unjust. Further, there is an additional inherent leniency in serving the sentence by way of Intensive Correction Order.
	
	
	If this sentence is within the existing range for possession of this type of weapon, then the range is inadequate, even allowing for the subjective circumstances of the offender.
	
	
	Having expressed that view, it would be inappropriate and unjust in the present circumstances to alter retrospectively the relevant range in such a way as to prejudice the current respondent. The purpose of a Crown appeal against sentence is primarily to establish principles for the governance and guidance of sentencing courts: Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; (2011) 244 CLR 462.
	
	
	I have expressed my view on the only principle that has been raised. I am not satisfied that the Crown has satisfied the burden of “establishing that the [residual] discretion conferred…should be exercised to vary the sentence imposed by the court of trial”: CMB v Attorney-General (NSW) [2015] HCA 9; (2015) 317 ALR 308.
	
	
	I agree with the orders proposed by Bellew J.
	
	
	BELLEW J: On 1 July 2013 Shannon Bernard Farrell (“the respondent”) pleaded guilty to a charge of possessing an unauthorised pistol contrary to s. 7(1) of the Firearms Act 1996 (NSW) (“the Act”). The maximum penalty for that offence is imprisonment for 14 years. A standard non-parole period of 3 years is prescribed.
	
	
	When the matter came before his Honour Judge Hanley SC in the District Court, the respondent asked his Honour to take into account four additional matters contained in a Form 1 namely:
	



	
	possessing ammunition without authority;
	
	
	possessing unregistered firearms;
	
	
	not keeping firearm safely; and
	
	
	possessing firearm with defaced identification.
	



	
	On 19 September 2014 his Honour sentenced the respondent to imprisonment for 2 years, to be served by way of an Intensive Correction Order to date from 19 September 2014 and to expire on 18 September 2016.
	
	
	On 16 October 2014, pursuant to s. 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), the Director of Public Prosecutions filed a notice of appeal to this Court against the sentence imposed on the respondent, on the ground that it is manifestly inadequate.
	


THE HISTORY OF THE PROCEEDINGS


	
	The respondent was refused bail when initially arrested. By the time the sentence proceedings first came before his Honour on 21 November 2013 the respondent had spent almost 9 ½ months in custody. On that day, his Honour dealt with the matter pursuant to s. 11 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) and released the respondent on conditional bail. In doing so his Honour said (at ROS 1-2):
	


“I am satisfied that the material before me is that important surgery should take place and part of the granting of the Griffith Remand under s 11 is pursuant to subs(1)(c) of the Act to allow the surgery on the offender's hand to take place. I note that there is evidence before me that suggests that if it is not done at some stage in the near future the damage could be permanent and debilitating to him.

Additionally I also have material before me that suggests that it would be appropriate to give him the opportunity to undertake further supervised rehabilitation outside of that available in the correctional services. It has been my experience, particularly since my very short time on the Bench that there is little or not (sic) availability of drug rehabilitation programs in cusotdy (sic) prior to sentencing. There is (sic) no appropriate programs for people on remand when one would think this is the most appropriate time for them to be available. Those people suffer an unfair disadvantage to those who have been granted bail and on remand who can undertake rehabilitation and therefore present a far more favourable picture to the Court in sentencing.”


	
	The Crown lodged an appeal to this Court on the grounds that the sentence imposed by his Honour was manifestly inadequate: R v Farrell [2014] NSWCCA 30. R A Hulme J (with whom Hoeben CJ at CL and Adams J agreed) concluded (at [67]) that the sentencing discretion had miscarried but that in circumstances where the matter was expected to come before the sentencing judge again in a short time, it was impractical to make the orders sought by the Crown. For that reason, although error was found, the Crown appeal was dismissed (at [69]).
	
	
	In reaching his conclusions, R A Hulme J said the following about the nature of the offence with which the respondent had been charged (at [63]-[64]):
	


“[63] Relevant matters to take into account in an assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence will include the nature of the weapon; the circumstances attending the respondent's possession of it; the fact that it was loaded and its identification information had been defaced; and that further ammunition was found with it. Obviously relevant as well is the seriousness with which Parliament has indicated that such offences are, given the prescription of a 14 year maximum penalty and a 3 year standard non-parole period.”


	
	The matter came back before the sentencing judge on 4 July 2014. Having heard further submissions from the parties, his Honour adjourned the matter to 18 July 2014. On that day, his Honour concluded that the respondent should be sentenced to a term of imprisonment not exceeding two years. Having made that determination, he considered whether there were any alternatives to a full time custodial sentence and adjourned the proceedings to allow the respondent to be assessed as to his suitability for an Intensive Correction Order.
	
	
	The matter then came back before his Honour on 19 September 2014. A favourable assessment having been made, the Intensive Correction Order was imposed, subject to various conditions.
	


THE FACTS


	
	His Honour summarised the facts as follows (commencing at ROS 4):
	


“The offender Shannon Farrell has regularly attended ""Elite Car Audio"", a commercial building at 33 Queen Street, Campbelltown. The business is registered in his de facto partner's name. The statement of facts refers to her as Amanda Peach but I think it is Leach. The offender is not the holder of a firearms licence or permit.

The offender registered the company, was the sole director, shareholder and secretary thereof until 5 November 2012. After this date, those positions were transferred to his de-facto wife.

On 31 January 2013 police executed two search warrants authorising them to search Elite Car Audio and the home premises at 193 Longhurst Road, Minto, respectively. Those warrants were simultaneously executed about 8.37 on 1 February 2013.

The offender had the nature of the warrant explained to him, he was handed a copy, and the entirety of the search warrant was recorded on video. The offender was asked whether there were any items that were listed on the search warrant (drugs, drug paraphernalia, drug ledgers, mobiles, scales, money). The offender said there was nothing. A systematic search of the premises yielded no results.

The workshop that was located at the rear of the store and separate to the main showroom or retail section of the store. Whilst searching the rear of the building, police observed a ""show car"" that was partially disassembled and in the process of being restored. Most of the interior of the panels of the car were removed and stacked inside the car. Police searched the car. A bundle of cloth taped together with black electrical tape was located in the wall panel of the rear left passenger door. The find was photographed in situ. The item was removed, and after the cloth and tape was removed, there was revealed a 9 millimetre Uzi machine pistol with an attached magazine containing 15 rounds of ammunition. The serial numbers of the Uzi had been defaced rendering it unreadable. The Uzi was located with a box containing 40 rounds of 9 millimetre live ammunition.

The offender was cautioned and questioned in relation to the firearm and ammunition but denied any knowledge. He stated the car did not belong to him. It was handed over along with the business when purchased by the offender in October 2012. He was questioned as to whether his DNA would be on the gun and responded, ""No, no way.""

Police located the engine for that car in the offender's garage during the search warrant executed at his home.

CCTV footage was retrieved from within the business premises. This was from a computer tower that was seized at the search warrant. Ms Leach supplied the password to police and CCTV was retrieved covering days 23 January 2013 to 1 February 2013 inclusive.

On 23 January 2013 cameras entitled 31 and 32 captured images of the offender talking to two other unknown men. One of these men approached the left rear passenger door of the ""show car"" and was looking through it. The offender did so as well and reached in through the window and moved an object that had a similar shape and size to the Uzi that had been located. The offender approached the workshop station near the boot of the car with the object that was covered with a light-coloured cloth. He did this in the company of the other men. A few minutes after that, he manipulated the object in a manner consistent with wrapping it in a fashion as it was found by police. He then placed the object in what appeared to be the panel of the left rear passenger door.

On 24 January 2013 cameras entitled 31 and 32 captured the image of the offender standing outside the left rear passenger door reaching through the window and fumbling around. Shortly thereafter he retrieves an object that was similar to the size of the Uzi and examines it. A minute later, he leaves the area without the object. He returns shortly thereafter and reaches in through the car and talks to an unknown man who was present. They then look through and rummage through the car. The offender finds an object that again has a similar appearance to the Uzi and leaves the area.

Police conducted forensic procedures and obtained fingerprints and DNA from the offender. Subsequent forensic testing identified fingerprints belonging to the offender on the Uzi, as well as his DNA that was found on the trigger, trigger guard and handgrip, bolt handle, and external surfaces of the box containing the ammunition.

Ballistic forensic testing identified that the Uzi had been altered to operate in a fully automatic firing mode. The prohibited firearm is deemed to be a 9 millimetre Luger calibre IMI manufactured selective fire submachine gun, serial number obliterated. It was test fired in working order and was capable of propelling, by means of an explosive, a projectile that could inflict a lethal wound upon a human being. It was capable of propelling projectiles in rapid succession during one push of the trigger. Analysis by ballistics had identified that the firearm fires at a rate of 1,700 rounds per minute with a muzzle velocity of 345 metres per second. The effective range of the firearm is 100 metres. The cartridges found are designed for use in firearms chambered for 9 millimetre Luger calibre cartridges.

Around 8.30 on 6 February 2013, the offender was arrested and conveyed to Campbelltown Police Station where he was offered the opportunity to be interviewed, but after speaking to his barrister, he declined to do so.”

HIS HONOUR’S FINDINGS AS TO THE RESPONDENT’S OFFENDING


	
	In considering the objective seriousness of the respondent’s offending, his Honour (commencing at ROS 7) referred at length to what he described to as the “inherent nature of the firearm”. He noted, in particular, that the firearm was:
	



	
	incapable of being registered;
	
	
	in working order;
	
	
	loaded;
	
	
	capable of firing a large number of projectiles within a short period of time;
	
	
	kept in close proximity to other ammunition;
	
	
	defaced, in the sense that the serial number had been removed;
	
	
	secreted in the shell of the show car as opposed to being kept under lock and key; and
	
	
	small and easily secreted.
	



	
	His Honour noted (at ROS 8) that there were no other items such as a silencer secreted with the firearm, and that the respondent had been in possession of it for a relatively short period of time. Whilst his Honour acknowledged that criminality of this nature was not necessarily affected by the period of possession, he observed that a short period of possession may, in some circumstances, be capable of reducing the objective seriousness of the offence.
	
	
	His Honour then turned (commencing at ROS 8) to the circumstances in which the respondent came into possession of the firearm and found (at ROS 10) that he possessed it as a result of unexpectedly finding it in the show car. His Honour contrasted such circumstances with those in which an offender might deliberately obtain an unauthorised firearm for a particular purpose. He concluded (at ROS 10) that the respondent did not plan to come into possession of the firearm, but that once he located it he had decided to retain it.
	
	
	His Honour found (at ROS 11) that there was no evidence before the court to suggest that the respondent:
	



	
	possessed the firearm for any intended criminal purpose;
	
	
	was intending to hand over the firearm to others for any intended criminal purpose;
	
	
	was proposing to sell the firearm;
	
	
	had discharged the firearm; or
	
	
	had permitted others to discharge it.
	



	
	Having cited these matters his Honour said (at ROS 11):
	


“Importantly, there is no evidence of this type that critically goes to the nature of his possession that could characterise it as objectively serious or grave.”


	
	That finding represented a rejection of the Crown submission on sentence that the offending fell above the mid-range of objective seriousness.
	
	
	His Honour went on to note (at ROS 11) that the respondent had told Professor Woods, whose reports were tendered on sentence, that he had no intention of ever selling or using the weapon. His Honour expressly accepted Professor Woods’ evidence (at ROS 14).
	
	
	Ultimately his Honour concluded (at ROS 12):
	


“(12) In determining the objective gravity of the offender's criminality by reference to all of the factors relevant to such a determination, I am satisfied that it is below the midrange for such offending. Despite the presence of factors that are relevant to the inherent nature of the firearm, I am satisfied that those factors that characterise the nature of the possession and the manner in which the offender came into possession are well below the midrange of seriousness.

The circumstances of the latter two factors are somewhat unique when compared to the facts for other offences of this kind and underline the importance of each sentence being apposite to the particular facts before the Court.”

THE RESPONDENT’S SUBJECTIVE CASE


	
	A number of reports of Professor Stephen Woods, Psychologist, were tendered in the respondent’s case on sentence. As I have noted, his Honour accepted the evidence of Professor Woods who documented the respondent’s previous illicit use of drugs, secondary to injuries sustained in a motor vehicle accident.
	
	
	In a report of 1 October 2013 Professor Woods said:
	


“When questioned about the circumstances surrounding the offence Mr Farrell explained that he suffered quite serious injuries in a motor cycle accident in September 2011. I understand that Mr Farrell was unconscious for an unspecified period of time and that he was transferred by ambulance to Liverpool Hospital. Further, that upon discharge after three (3) days, he was advised the continuing severe shoulder and hand pain was not due to fractures and that “it would heal on its own”.

…

Mr Farrell stated that the severe nature of his hand and shoulder pain resulted in him being prescribed the opiate medication Oxycontin.”

He stated that failure of this medication to alleviate the major part of his pain, along with boredom in response to not being able to return to work or engage in preferred pasttimes, caused him to become depressed and in this regard (he) stated:

“I wanted to sleep through it”.

I understand that Mr Farrell subsequently “obtained” the prescription medication Xanax in an attempt to better control the pain and enable him to sleep. His reliance on this medication rapidly escalated to at least five (5) tablets daily (i.e. at least two [2] at night and three [3] during the day). Mr Farrell disclosed that he also became increasingly reliant on a cocktail of illicit drugs that included crystal methamphetamine and cannabis; he stated:

“I used anything I could get my hands on.”

When it became apparent he would never be able to return to his trade, Mr Farrell and his partner “took over” and acquired existing stock as well as other assets of the motor vehicle accessory business “Extreme Audio”. The business name was later changed to Elite Audio. Mr Farrell explained that the owner/proprietor of Extreme Audio was subject to ongoing police investigations and was awaiting trial in relation to charges involving the sale of firearms.

Mr Farrell explained that his increasingly heavy use of prescription and illicit drugs resulted in a constant state of intoxication with loss of awareness of reality. He reported to have begun to sleep in the garage at his home, and to have effectively ceased associating (except at the most basic level) with his family.”

…

Assessment of Mr Farrell in 2005 documented a disturbing history of heavy chronic illicit drug use and depression secondary to aggravating a pre-existing hand injury in a motor vehicle accident. Substance abuse related to brain damage was felt to be a possibility.


	
	Professor Woods also gave oral evidence in the sentence proceedings. He expressed the opinion (at T34 L18 on 21 November 2013) that the respondent’s judgment was “grossly impaired” at the time of the offending.
	
	
	The respondent had a criminal history which included a conviction in 2012 for possession of ammunition without authority. His Honour found (at ROS 18) that such history was not particularly lengthy or significant, but that it disqualified the respondent from receiving the benefit of any particular leniency that might have been available to him had he had no history at all. His Honour did not identify any other aggravating factor(s).
	
	
	In terms of mitigating factors, his Honour firstly noted the respondent’s early plea of guilty which entitled him to a discount of 25%. Although the respondent did not give evidence in the sentence proceedings, his Honour relied upon Professor Woods’ reports and opinions, as well as evidence from the respondent’s partner, to support a conclusion that there was “some remorse” demonstrated. Consistent with his findings as to the circumstances of the offending, his Honour concluded (at ROS 19) that the respondent’s possession of the firearm was not planned, and appeared to have come about “as a matter of chance”. Based largely upon the evidence of Professor Woods, along with evidence of the respondent’s abstinence from illegal drugs for a significant period, his Honour concluded (at ROS 22) that the respondent was unlikely to re-offend providing he continued to pursue his various courses of study and continued his rehabilitation.
	


SUBMISSIONS OF THE CROWN


	
	As I have noted, the Crown relied upon a single ground of appeal, namely that the sentence was manifestly inadequate. In order to succeed on the appeal the Crown must establish that the sentence was unreasonable or plainly unjust: Dinsdale v R [2000] HCA 54; (2000) 202 CLR 321. The Crown relied upon a number of matters which, it submitted, demonstrated the seriousness of the offending and the manifest inadequacy of the sentence imposed.
	
	
	Firstly, the Crown relied upon the nature and characteristics of the firearm. The Crown emphasised, at some length, that the firearm had been modified to enable it to fire multiple rounds upon a single depression of the trigger and submitted that this, combined with the fact that it was fully functional, greatly increased the seriousness of the respondent’s possession of it. It was submitted that his Honour “appeared to have overlooked” these matters.
	
	
	Secondly, the Crown pointed to a number of other circumstances surrounding the respondent’s possession of the firearm, all of which were said to increase the objective seriousness of the offending. These included the fact that the respondent handled the firearm on two occasions, that it was not stored securely, and that it was found loaded and in close proximity to additional rounds of ammunition.
	
	
	Thirdly, the Crown submitted that the combination of these various circumstances with the respondent’s illicit drug use had given rise to a “very dangerous situation” which warranted significant weight being attached to both specific and general deterrence.
	
	
	Fourthly, the Crown relied on the fact that the weapon had been defaced and its identification removed. This, it was submitted, was “consistent with its use for a criminal purpose”. In this regard the Crown submitted that there was unchallenged evidence that in 2013 the respondent was a member of an outlaw motorcycle gang. As I understood it, the fact of the respondent’s membership of such a gang (if it was a fact) was relied upon to support the proposition that the firearm was being used, or was intended to be used, for some criminal purpose. That proposition was, of course, directly contrary to the unchallenged findings made by the sentencing judge.
	
	
	Fifthly, the Crown submitted that although the matters on the Form 1 necessarily overlapped with the substantive charge, they reinforced the need for personal deterrence and retribution.
	
	
	Finally, the Crown submitted that the sentence imposed reflected little or no weight having been given to the relevant purposes of sentencing for offences against s. 7(1) of the Act. In written submissions, the Crown went so far as to submit that the sentencing judge had been “distracted” throughout the sentencing process by the appellant’s subjective case and had “unduly focussed on the standard non-parole period and did not have proper regard to the maximum penalty as part of his intuitive synthesis”. It was submitted that as a consequence of these factors a manifestly inadequate sentence had been imposed.
	


SUBMISSIONS OF THE RESPONDENT


	
	The respondent submitted that it was evident from the remarks on sentence that the sentencing judge was aware of the necessity to undertake an assessment of the relevant criminality, bearing in mind both the maximum penalty and the prescribed standard non-parole period. It was also submitted that it was appropriate for his Honour to have regard, when determining sentence, to the fact that the respondent had served a 9½ month period of actual custody prior to the imposition of the sentence.
	
	
	It was submitted that the sentence imposed was within the appropriate range, particularly having regard to the factual findings of the sentencing judge regarding the circumstances of the respondent’s possession of the firearm, and his personal circumstances. It was further submitted that in order to establish that the sentence was manifestly inadequate, it was incumbent upon the Crown to identify error of the kind discussed in House v the King [1936] HCA 40; (1936) 55 CLR 499. It was submitted that the Crown had failed to do so, and that the appeal should be dismissed.
	


PRINCIPLES APPLICABLE TO A CROWN APPEAL AGAINST INADEQUACY


	
	The right of appeal by the Crown against a sentence which is said to be manifestly inadequate is an exceptional one. It must be exercised with restraint, in order to allow the Court to lay down sentencing principles: Griffiths v R [1977] HCA 44; (1977) 137 CLR 293; Everett v R [1994] HCA 49; (1994) 181 CLR 295; R v MD and ors [2005] NSWCCA 342; (2005) 156 A Crim R 372. In Green v R; Quinn v R [2011] HCA 49; (2011) 244 CLR 462 French CJ, Crennan and Kiefel JJ put the matter in this way (at [1] and [36], citations omitted):
	


[1] The primary purpose of appeals against sentence by the Attorney-General or Director of Public Prosecutions (“Crown appeals”) under s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) (“the Criminal Appeal Act”) is “to lay down principles for the governance and guidance of courts having the duty of sentencing convicted persons.” That purpose distinguishes Crown appeals from appeals against severity of sentence by convicted persons, which are concerned with the correction of judicial error in particular cases. The Court of Criminal Appeal of New South Wales, in the exercise of its jurisdiction under s 5D, has a discretion to decline to interfere with a sentence even though the sentence is erroneously lenient. That discretion is sometimes called the “residual discretion”.

….

[36] A primary consideration relevant to the exercise of the residual discretion is the purpose of Crown appeals under s 5D which, as observed earlier in these reasons, is “to lay down principles for the governance and guidance of courts having the duty of sentencing convicted persons.” That is a limiting purpose. It does not extend to the general correction of errors made by sentencing judges. It provides a framework within which to assess the significance of factors relevant to the exercise of the discretion.”

CONSIDERATION


	
	In considering the submissions of the parties two matters must be emphasised at the outset.
	
	
	Firstly, the inherently serious nature of offending against s. 7(1) of the Act is reflected in the maximum penalty set by Parliament. In the present case, the Crown placed significant reliance upon the nature and characteristics of the firearm to demonstrate what was said to be the seriousness of the offending and the manifest inadequacy of the sentence. However, they were not the only factors which were relevant in determining the seriousness of the offending. Given the charge, the nature and circumstances of the respondent’s possession of the firearm were obviously relevant.
	
	
	Secondly, none of the factual findings of the sentencing judge were the subject of any challenge by the Crown before this Court. This included his Honour’s findings as to:
	



	
	the circumstances in which the respondent came into possession of the firearm;
	
	
	the absence of any evidence that he intended to use it; and
	
	
	his low level of moral culpability.
	



	
	It is plain from his Honour’s observations (at ROS 7-8) that he was aware of, and took into account, the various characteristics of the firearm. His analysis of those characteristics was lengthy and detailed. In those circumstances it was not, in my view, open to the Crown to submit to this Court that the seriousness of the respondent’s possession arising from the nature of the firearm was something that his Honour “appeared to have overlooked”.
	
	
	Further, his Honour dealt at length with the circumstances in which the respondent came into possession of the firearm. As I have noted, he found (at ROS 10) that such possession arose from unexpectedly finding the firearm in the show car. His Honour concluded that the respondent did not plan to come into possession of the firearm but that having done so, he had decided to retain it. All of these findings were consistent with his Honour’s conclusion that the offending fell below the mid-range of objective seriousness.
	
	
	The location of the firearm in immediate proximity to additional rounds of ammunition was relevant to an assessment of the seriousness of the offending: R v Thalari [2009] NSWCCA 170; (2009) 75 NSWLR 307 at [88]. However, that factor was rendered of less significance in the present case in light of his Honour’s findings set out at [27], [28] and [31] above.
	
	
	There was, as I have outlined, evidence that the respondent was in the habit of using illicit drugs at or about the time of the offending. In other circumstances, that may have supported the Crown’s submission that a position of particular danger had been created as a consequence of the respondent’s possession of the firearm. However, leaving aside the fact there was no evidence that the respondent was under the influence of any drug at a time when he handled the firearm, the fact of his addiction is of less significance in light of his Honour’s finding that there was no evidence to support the conclusion that he had any intention of using it.
	
	
	There is no doubt that the identification markings of the firearm had been defaced. In some circumstances, that may well be consistent with the intended use of the weapon for a criminal purpose. However, and again leaving aside the fact that his Honour found no evidence to support any intention on the part of the respondent to use the firearm, he also found (at ROS 7) that there was no evidence that the respondent was responsible for defacing it.
	
	
	In support of the proposition that the respondent’s possession of the firearm was linked to some criminal purpose, the Crown submitted that there was “unchallenged” evidence of the respondent’s previous membership of an outlaw motorcycle gang. In this regard, the Crown pointed to a report of Professor Woods of 1 July 2014 which stated (inter alia):
	


“Mr Farrell is making excellent therapeutic progress and in this regard –

a)…

b)…

c) no longer views himself as being a member of the Rebels O.M.C.G. and in fact now regrets having become a member of the O.M.C.G.;

d)…

e)…”


	
	To the extent that this may have constituted evidence that the respondent had in fact been a member of an outlaw motorcycle gang at some point, there was no evidence that such membership coincided with the time of his offending.
	
	
	An assertion was made by the officer in charge of the investigation when giving evidence in the sentence proceedings that the respondent was a member of an outlaw motor cycle gang (commencing at T13 L33 on 21 November 2013):
	


“Q: Is it your understanding the offender is a member of an outlaw motorcycle gang?

A: Yes, the Rebels.

CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR JAMES

Q: In relation to that last matter you spoke about, is your information concerning that as reliable as the evidence that you have given of the two earlier matters that you spoke about?

A: So the evidence in relation to the charge against Mathew Farrell?

Q: Firstly, you read somebody else’s statement of facts?

A: Yes.

Q: And you have an understanding of that statement of facts that you gained from reading it?

A: Yes.

Q: And you’re giving evidence as though it were, as far as you’re concerned, representing the truth. Is that right?

A: Well the information that I’ve given is only from what I have read from the facts sheet, as I said.

Q: And your understanding?

A: Yes.

Q: Which may or may not be accurate?

A: Yes.”


	
	Contrary to the submission advanced by the Crown, there was clearly a challenge to this evidence. There was an equally clear concession by the witness that his “understanding” the respondent may have been a member of the Rebels Outlaw Motorcycle Gang he may not have been accurate. The Crown’s reliance, before this Court, upon such evidence was in my view misplaced.
	
	
	In respect of the matters contained in the Form 1, his Honour said (at ROS 1-2):
	


“I propose, as advocated by the solicitor for the DPP, to take these four offences on the Form 1 into account when assessing the objective seriousness of the principal offence. I shall not take them into account again, as is the practice, where the sentencing process involves offences included on a Form 1. To do so would be to double count their respective impact in the sentencing process. I understand the solicitor advocate for the DPP agrees with this approach.”


	
	It is evident from that passage that his Honour was aware of those matters and that he took them into account in the sentencing process. It is also evident, from his express reference to it at the commencement of his sentencing remarks, that his Honour was aware of the maximum penalty and the prescribed standard non-parole period.
	
	
	The respondent had the benefit of a series of favourable findings made by the sentencing judge as to the nature and extent of his possession and the level of his moral culpability. None of those findings were challenged on this appeal. They support the conclusion reached by the sentencing judge that the offending fell below the mid-range of seriousness.
	
	
	Moreover, the sentence imposed was one of imprisonment for a lengthy period, albeit one which was to be served other than in full time custody. It was also relevant that the respondent had spent almost 9 ½ months in custody in relation to this matter when his bail had been refused.
	
	
	In all of these circumstances, I am not persuaded that the sentence is unreasonable or plainly unjust.
	


ORDERS


	
	For the forgoing reasons I propose the following order:
	



	
	The Crown appeal is dismissed.

2703546,R v Omar [2015] NSWCCA 67,"Judgment


	
	SIMPSON J: I agree with Bellew J.
	
	
	ROTHMAN J: I agree with Bellew J. The sentence imposed, while lenient, is within range for the peculiar circumstances of the respondent.
	
	
	The mere fact, if it were the fact, that this Court would have imposed a more severe sentence is insufficient to warrant interference in the exercise of discretion and, in this case, even if it were sufficient, the Crown appeal does not raise an issue of the kind that satisfies the burden imposed upon it of establishing that the residual discretion not to vary the sentence should not be exercised: CMB v Attorney-General (NSW) [2015] HCA 9; (2015) 317 ALR 308 at [6].
	
	
	BELLEW J: On 14 August 2013 Michael Omar (“the respondent”) pleaded guilty before the Local Court to the following:
	



	
	aggravated sexual intercourse without consent: Crimes Act 1900 s. 61J(1) (sequence 1);
	
	
	aggravated robbery whilst armed with an offensive weapon causing wounding: Crimes Act 1900 s. 98 (sequence 2);
	
	
	aggravated sexual intercourse without consent: Crimes Act 1900 s. 61J (sequence 3); and
	
	
	aggravated sexual intercourse without consent: Crimes Act 1900 s. 61J(1) (sequence 4).
	



	
	In addition, the respondent pleaded guilty to breaching a bond which had been imposed upon him pursuant to s. 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. The offending in sequences 1, 3 and 4 occurred on 17 July 2004. The offending in sequence 2 occurred on 13 September 2006. It was not until 10 December 2012 that the respondent was arrested and charged. The identification of the respondent as the offender came about through DNA matching.
	
	
	On 11 September 2014 the respondent was sentenced by his Honour Judge Jeffreys in the District Court as follows:
	



	
	as to sequence 1, imprisonment for 4 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 2 years and 3 months, to date from 11 November 2014;
	
	
	as to sequence 2, imprisonment for 4 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 2 years, to date from 11 August 2016;
	
	
	as to sequence 3, imprisonment for 5 years with a non-parole period of 2 years and 6 months, to date from 11 March 2015;
	
	
	as to sequence 4, imprisonment for 6 years with a non-parole period of 2 years and 6 months, to date from 11 July 2015.
	



	
	In respect of the breach of bond, the respondent was sentenced to imprisonment for 12 months with a non-parole period of 4 months, to date from 11 September 2014.
	
	
	The overall sentence imposed was 6 years and 10 months with a non-parole period of 3 years and 11 months. The respondent will be eligible for parole on 10 August 2018.
	
	
	By notice dated 2 October 2014 the Director of Public Prosecutions appealed to this Court, pursuant to s. 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, against the sentences imposed on the respondent, on the grounds of manifest inadequacy.
	


THE FACTS


	
	The sentencing judge summarised the facts as follows (commencing at ROS 3):
	


The agreed facts in relation to the aggravated sexual intercourse without consent are that in 2004 the complainant was a 39 year old mother of two children who resided with her husband and children in Bankstown. Part of her routine was to take a morning walk around the area. She took the same route each day. Around 6am on 17 July she left for her morning walk. There was not much light in the street. As she walked along one of the streets she looked to her left and saw a male person. That male person was the offender who was walking in the park. He walked towards her. She noticed that he was wearing something yellow. About 2 minutes later she reached the first building which was attached to the Bankstown Senior College. She was struck hard to the right side of her face from behind. She screamed for help and was immediately struck again from behind, and knocked to the ground. She screamed 'help' again. Each time she yelled out the offender said 'shut up.' She was struck four times.

When she was on the ground the offender picked her up and threw her over a low fence into the school grounds. As she landed she felt pain to her left shoulder. The offender grabbed her by the top of her jacket and dragged her backwards to her left side. She pleaded saying 'don't kill me, don't kill me, I've got two kids at home, please don't kill me.' The offender said 'shut up or I'll kill you.' She was scared and continued to plead with him. The offender dragged her about 6 metres and in the process her tracksuit pants began to come down. She tried to pull them up with her right hand as her left arm was in pain from earlier injury. At one point she managed to regain her feet. The offender then pushed her from behind. She continued to plead for her life. The offender kept saying 'shut up or I'll kill you.'

She did not scream much because she feared she was going to be killed. Shortly afterwards the offender told her to stop and to close her eyes. She managed to glimpse where she was before closing her eyes. She was in the rear school yard near the fence. The offender moved in front of her and said suck my cock and suck my balls and swallow.' He pushed her down so she was on her knees with her face level with his penis.

The offender pushed her face towards his penis and she felt that his penis was out of his pants. She opened her eyes and saw his flaccid penis.

He was not wearing a condom. In fear of her safety, she placed his penis in her mouth and began sucking his penis. She did this until the penis became hard. He kept saying ‘suck my dick, suck my cock and swallow.' She heard him moaning. She thought she was going to vomit. After a few minutes he said 'ok that's enough.' He did not ejaculate.

The offender pushed her on to her back and said 'don't move, don't move.' She was attempting to hold her pants in an effort to protect herself. The offender took hold of her right shoe, removed her right tracksuit pant leg and underwear and pulled her legs apart. She tried to keep them closed but she was unable to do so. The offender told her to open them wider. He lifted her legs in the air and stretched them apart. He knelt in front of her and inserted his penis into her vagina. He said ‘is it in ‘and she said ‘yes.' He thrust his erect penis in and out of her vagina for a few minutes. The offender stopped and said 'I am going to put it in your anus.' She said 'just do what you want to do, just don't kill me.' The offender said 'is it virgin there' and she said 'yes of course.' He was still holding up her legs, she had her right arm over her face, covering her eyes. The offender then placed his penis in her anus. That activity was for a short period of time.

A short time later the offender stopped. The complainant was unsure if he had ejaculated. She began to put on her underwear. She had her eyes closed. She heard the offender say 'don't move or I'll shoot you and don't peep. I warn you if the police come and get me I'll come and get you and kill you.'

She lay there for a few minutes before she sat up. She put on herunderwear, pants, and shoes and stood up and began to walk but it was painful. She hobbled to the Bankstown hospital and whilst she was doing that she was looking out for the offender. When she got to the hospital she started saying 'please help me.' She hobbled into the front entrance of the hospital and called for help. A security guard came and assisted her and took her to the Emergency Department. She was transported to Liverpool hospital sexual assault unit, where she was examined and on examination it was found that she had bruising to her right eye and face which resulted in complete loss of vision for a few days.

The complainant also sustained bruising and scratches to her right hand, lumps on her head, cuts to her left shoulder, a broken left shoulder, bruising and grazing on her left side, and pain to her back, neck and right shoulder. A sample of semen was taken from a high swab of her vagina.

The facts in relation to the offending on 13 September 2006 are that Mohammed Kanbar and another person worked at the A1 Noor Butchery in Auburn. Mr Kanbar was a casual employee. On 13 September Mr Kanbar started his shift about 8am. At about 9.30am the other employee arrived at the shop then left to go to the bank. At around 10.40am the offender entered the butcher's through the rear entrance. Mr Kanbar did not recognise him. The offender greeted Mr Kanbar in Arabic, saying 'good business.' Mr Kanbar replied 'thank God.' At the time that the offender entered the shop Mr Kanbar was cutting up lamb and completing an order. He thought that the man was a delivery driver and the two spoke about the business. Mr Kanbar put the knife he was using on a bench and walked to the mincing machine. As he did this he turned his back on the offender.

He then felt a punch to the right side of his face which caused pain and nearly knocked him unconscious. He sustained a cut under his right eye which began to bleed. He felt a number of punches to his face, head and body. He later realised that he sustained a number of stab wounds to his head, face and body. He ended up face down on the ground. He felt his wallet being taken from his right back pocket. The offender then left the store.

A short time later, Mr Kanbar picked up his mobile phone, walked out of the front of the shop and sat on the footpath. A passer-by called triple O. Police arrived shortly afterwards and established a crime scene. On a canvass of the area police found a knife on the fence line at the rear of an adjacent property. Forensic examination of that knife revealed a DNA profile different from that of Mr Kanbar. At the time the DNA profile was not matched on the DNA database.

Mr Kanbar's wallet was found close by and handed to the police. Mr Kanbar was taken to Westmead Hospital where he was examined and found to have lacerations around the left and right orbit and posterior scalp, a laceration to the right cheek, a laceration to the right pectoral and nipple, lacerations to the left and right side of his back and laceration to his left forearm. All of these injuries required sutures except the injury to his head which required two sutures and nine staples. He also sustained a small fracture to his nose requiring surgery. Mr Kanbar spent two days in Westmead Hospital. The proceeds of the robbery were $60 in cash and a number of personal cards. The float from the till was not taken.

In October 2011 police received information that the offender may be responsible in relation to the matters, they commenced investigation and obtained a DNA sample from the offender. His DNA matched the DNA on the database taken in relation to the sexual assault and the attack on Mr Kanbar. On 10 December 2012 police attended the home address of the offender and arrested him.”

THE FINDINGS OF THE SENTENCING JUDGE


	
	The sentencing judge found (at ROS 8) that each of the offences for which the respondent was to be sentenced was objectively serious and that no sentence other than a term of imprisonment would be appropriate. Having referred to various authorities, his Honour turned to an assessment of the objective criminality of the offending and said (commencing at ROS 9):
	


“In assessing the objective criminality I draw from the cases the following propositions; the fact that an offence is an isolated incident is not irrelevant to its valuation for purposes of assessing whether it is in the mid-range. Where an offence is defined in the statute to include several categories of conduct, the heinousness of the conduct in a particular case depends not on the statute defining the offence or the particular category of conduct but on the facts of the case in which the nature of intercourse will be but one factor that will determine the seriousness of the offence.

While penile/vaginal penetration may well be more serious than forced fellatio, it does not mean that fellatio must necessarily fall below the mid-point of seriousness. Matters of aggravation will be matters that may lift a matter to or beyond that point. Other matters that may impact on it include how the offence took place, the span of time over which an offence occurred, the degree of force or coercion applied to the complainant, the use of threats before or after a criminal intercourse to ensure compliance with demands made, and/or subsequent silence, the level of physical and other harm done to the complainant.

The forms of intercourse in relation to the complainant was forced oralintercourse, forced vaginal intercourse and forced anal intercourse. Somepeople might think that this is a more serious form of sexual intercourse thanothers, whilst others might take a different view. In times past it wassometimes said there were gradations of forms of sexual intercourse. I do notbelieve that it is possible to say that forced oral sex is any worse or any betterthan forced vaginal sex, or any worse or any better than forced anal sex.

In this matter I need to also take into account that so far as the vaginal sexual intercourse was concerned, the offender ejaculated. The offender had that form of sexual intercourse which is generally regarded as the most serious form of sexual intercourse covered by the definition of the term. The courts have traditionally regarded the risks of pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases associated with unprotected penile/vaginal intercourse as well as the very personal, intimate nature of such acts as demonstrating that offences of this kind are very serious indeed. Of course in this case I note the high vaginal swab indicates that the offender had unprotected sex with the complainant. In this matter the level of violence was considerable.

In relation to the offence of armed robbery with wounding, in accordance with the authorities I need to take into account the guideline judgment in relation to armed robbery in Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346. The guideline in Henry relates to a young offender with no or little criminal history, a weapon like a knife capable of killing or inflicting serious injury, limited degree of planning, limited if any actual violence but a real threat thereof, victim in a vulnerable position such as a shopkeeper or taxi driver, small amount taken and a late plea the significance of which is limited by a strong prosecution case. The guideline in Henry indicated that a sentence in the region of four to five years would be expected.

…

So it seems that the Henry guideline is between three years and three years and nine months for an early plea such as the plea here. As this is an offence of armed robbery with wounding, any guideline needs to be adjusted upwards to take into account the more serious offence.

So far as the robbery with wounding is concerned it seems to me that the offending was opportunistic. It seems that the offender went to the shop. I am not able to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that at that particular time he went there to rob it.

It seems that when Mr Kanbar turned his back on the offender, the offender then struck Mr Kanbar and then availed himself of the knife which Mr Kanbar had just left where he was cutting up the lamb. It was clear that there was no planning, in my view, in relation to that matter and he needs to be sentenced as if it were an opportunistic offence.

So far as the offending in relation to the aggravated sexual assault without consent is concerned, although the facts indicate that the complainant regularly took that particular path in her walk in the morning, there is nothing before me which would indicate that the offender had any knowledge of that. It seems to me that the offender came upon the complainant in the early hours of the morning. The material before me indicates that the offender, around that time, regularly slept in one or other of the local parks. It seems to me that so far as his offending in relation to that matter is concerned that again, I could not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt other than that it was also opportunistic.

The offending in July 2004 is aggravated in the sense that the offenceswere committed whilst the offender was on conditional liberty having been released on a bond pursuant to the provisions of s 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 on 19 April, a matter for which I have already sentenced him.”


	
	His Honour repeated his finding that the entirety of the offending was opportunistic at ROS 15.
	


THE RESPONDENT’S SUBJECTIVE CASE


	
	At the time of sentence the respondent was 33 years of age. He was born in Lebanon and spent the first 10 years of his life in Lebanon and Syria before migrating to Australia with his family.
	
	
	His Honour made lengthy reference (commencing at ROS 12) to a report of Professor Woods which was tendered in the respondent’s case on sentence and to which I have made further reference below when considering the individual grounds of appeal. His Honour found (at ROS 13) that at the time of the respective offending the respondent was using illicit drugs on a daily basis. However, he noted (at ROS 13) that at the conclusion of 2006 the respondent formed a new relationship and that with his partner’s assistance had now reached the point where he was drug free. The respondent’s partner has since given birth to three children. His Honour also found (at ROS 14) that the respondent had greatly assisted his partner with the care of her son from a previous relationship who has a number of special needs for which he receives psychological treatment. His Honour also found that after a period of estrangement, the respondent had re-established a relationship with his family who were supportive of him (at ROS 14).
	
	
	His Honour concluded (at ROS 14):
	


“Clearly in my view I am sentencing an offender who is a totally differentperson from the person who committed the offences in 2004 and in 2006. Theevidence establishes that the offender is now absent from drug abuse, he isemployed, he has close family supportive ties. The Crown in his submissionaccepts that the offender is rehabilitated.”


	
	His Honour then turned to the delay which had been occasioned in the matter and noted (at ROS 15) that DNA matching had brought the offences to light in 2011. His Honour referred to a number of authorities on the question of delay before concluding (at ROS 17):
	


“In my view there has been considerable rehabilitation and it is a matter that I need to take into account.

The Crown in his submission makes mention of the fact that the offender was in the community and did not admit to his offending. That may or may not be right, it may or may not be correct that the offender was in a position of being able to provide the police with sufficient particulars. I do not know and I am not prepared to speculate about these things but it seems to me, in accordance with the authorities, I need to take into account the rehabilitation that has been shown and that operates on questions of specific deterrence.”


	
	His Honour found (at ROS 17) that the respondent was deeply contrite. He also found (at ROS 20) that the son of the respondent’s partner would be considerably affected by the fact that the respondent was incarcerated. His Honour did not regard this as exceptional but treated it as a matter that he needed “to take into account in the factual matrix”.
	
	
	His Honour then proceeded to impose the sentences previously set out.
	


PRINCIPLES APPLICABLE TO A CROWN APPEAL AGAINST INADEQUACY


	
	The right of appeal by the Crown against a sentence which is said to be manifestly inadequate is an exceptional one. It is a right which must be exercised with restraint, so as to allow the Court to lay down sentencing principles: Griffiths v R [1977] HCA 44; (1977) 137 CLR 293; Everett v R [1994] HCA 49; (1994) 181 CLR 295; R v MD and ors [2005] NSWCCA 342; (2005) 156 A Crim R 372. In Green v R; Quinn v R [2011] HCA 49; (2011) 244 CLR 462 French CJ, Crennan and Kiefel JJ put the matter in this way (at [1] and [36], citations omitted):
	


""[1] The primary purpose of appeals against sentence by the Attorney-General or Director of Public Prosecutions (“Crown appeals”) under s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) (“the Criminal Appeal Act”) is “to lay down principles for the governance and guidance of courts having the duty of sentencing convicted persons.” That purpose distinguishes Crown appeals from appeals against severity of sentence by convicted persons, which are concerned with the correction of judicial error in particular cases. The Court of Criminal Appeal of New South Wales, in the exercise of its jurisdiction under s 5D, has a discretion to decline to interfere with a sentence even though the sentence is erroneously lenient. That discretion is sometimes called the “residual discretion”.

….

[36] A primary consideration relevant to the exercise of the residual discretion is the purpose of Crown appeals under s 5D which, as observed earlier in these reasons, is “to lay down principles for the governance and guidance of courts having the duty of sentencing convicted persons.” That is a limiting purpose. It does not extend to the general correction of errors made by sentencing judges. It provides a framework within which to assess the significance of factors relevant to the exercise of the discretion.”

THE GROUNDS OF APPEAL

Ground 1 – His Honour erred by finding the offender had mental problems

The evidence before the sentencing judge


	
	Exhibit 2 before the sentencing judge was a report of Professor Stephen Woods, Psychologist, dated 13 June 2013. That report was prepared following an examination and assessment conducted by Professor Woods on 30 April 2013.
	
	
	Professor Woods obtained a history from the respondent that he had a vague and incomplete memory of the offending which is the subject of sequences 1, 3 and 4. The respondent explained that he was living on the streets at that time, often staying with a group of fellow drug users in premises at Merrylands. He reported that during this period he sometimes spent the night at a park near where the sexual assaults were committed, in order to be close to his family home. The respondent told Professor Woods that at this time of his life he was drug affected every day.
	
	
	The respondent told Professor Woods that he had absolutely no memory of committing the armed robbery offence which is the subject of sequence 2 but that he accepted his guilt. Again, he cited his then drug dependence as the reason for his lack of memory.
	
	
	The respondent gave a history to Professor Woods of having commenced consuming alcohol on a regular basis at about 16 years of age. He said that he first experimented with cannabis at the age of 15 and that in his late teenage years his use of cannabis increased. At age 18-19 his drug use extended to cocaine. By the age of 21-22 he was addicted to crystal methamphetamine. He reported that he had been able to completely relinquish his drug habit with the support of his current partner.
	
	
	At Part 4:2 of his report, under the heading “Diagnosis”, Professor Woods reported in the following terms:
	


“In terms of a formal diagnosis, Mr Omar satisfies the criteria of: -

(Poly) Substance (illicit drugs) Dependence Disorder (DSM-IV-TR 304.80) in remission;

(Poly) Substance Induced Mood Disorder with mixed features (onset during intoxication and withdrawal) (D.S.M.-IV – TR);

Residual symptoms of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (P.T.S.D.) (D.S.M. -IV – TR 309.81) secondary to A) sexual abuse during childhood, B) exposure to war/conflicts but C) most importantly realisation of the nature of his offending behaviour and its impact on the victims.

Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Anxiety and Depressed Mood, secondary to the current matter (DSM – IV – TR 309.28)”.


	
	Professor Woods went on to state:
	


“In cases involving illicit drug use, sexual assault and physical assault with a weapon a diagnosis of Antisocial Personality Disorder would be appropriate. Further, a recommendation for inclusion in relevant offender rehabilitation programmes would have occurred.

In Mr Omar’s case however, it would appear that he has, with support and assistance of his partner, already largely rehabilitated himself. The main area in which Mr Omar requires treatment is that of trauma suffered in relation to his offending behaviour.”


	
	Professor Woods gave evidence in the sentence proceedings on 15 November 2013. He expressed the view (T3 L13-17) that the respondent had some symptoms of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder although not to the extent required to support a formal diagnosis. He said (commencing at T3 L19) that in his opinion the respondent’s symptoms of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder were partly the result of his experiences as a child in war torn Lebanon. Professor Woods went on to state (T3 L42 and following):
	


“…There is good evidence to – scientific evidence to support the argument that he would have been affected by that, predisposed to poor impulse control, plus a person who is exposed to trauma early and there was a sexual abuse of course that occurred as a child, that would have an influencing factor in leading to that poorly developed sense of self, that poorly developed sense of interacting with other people and appropriate boundaries, and leading onto the drug charge, drug use, yes.”


	
	The respondent also gave evidence. He confirmed (commencing at T10 L48) that he was currently drug free and had been for a number of years.
	


The findings of the sentencing judge


	
	At ROS 19, having referred to the evidence of Professor Woods, his Honour said:
	


“It is clear in my view that the offender has considerable mental problems as stated in Professor Woods’ report.”


	
	His Honour then cited the judgment of McClellan CJ at CL in Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194; (2010) 79 NSWLR 1 before stating (at ROS 19):
	


“In my view the offender's mental problems need to be considered in

relation to the moderation of general and specific deterrence and also how a

custodial sentence will impact on a person with his mental problems.”

Submissions of the Crown


	
	The Crown submitted that on a proper analysis, the effect of Professor Woods’ evidence was that any mental condition from which the respondent suffered was secondary to his voluntary use of illicit drugs. It was submitted that in these circumstances it was not open to the sentencing judge to find that the respondent had “mental problems”.
	
	
	In advancing this submission the Crown placed significant reliance upon the judgment of Wood CJ at CL in R v Henry [1999] NSWCCA 111; (1999) 46 NSWLR 346 at [273] and following where his Honour said:
	


“[273] In my view the relevant principles are as follows:

(a) the need to acquire funds to support a drug habit, even a severe habit, is not an excuse to commit an armed robbery or any similar offence, and of itself is not a matter of mitigation;

(b) however the fact that an offence is motivated by such a need may be taken into account as a factor relevant to the objective criminality of the offence in so far as it may throw light on matters such as:

(i) the impulsivity of the offence and the extent of any planning for it; (cf Bouchard (1996) 84 A Crim R 499 at 501-502); and Nolan (1988) VSCA 135 (2 December 1998);

(ii) the existence or non existence of any alternative reason that may have operated in aggravation of the offence, eg that it was motivated to fund some other serious criminal venture or to support a campaign of terrorism;

(iii) the state of mind or capacity of the offender to exercise judgment, eg if he or she was in the grips of an extreme state of withdrawal of the kind that may have led to a frank disorder of thought processes or to the act being other than a willed act;

(c) It may also be relevant as a subjective circumstance, in so far as the origin or extent of the addiction, and any attempts to overcome it, might:

(i) impact upon the prospects of recidivism/rehabilitation, in which respect it may on occasions prove to be a two-edged sword (eg Lewis Court of Criminal Appeal New South Wales 1 July 1992);

(ii) suggest that the addiction was not a matter of personal choice but was attributable to some other event for which the offender was not primarily responsible, for example where it arose as the result of the medical prescription of potentially addictive drugs following injury, illness, or surgery (cf Hodge Court of Criminal Appeal New South Wales 2 November 1993; and Talbot); or where it occurred at a very young age, or in a person whose mental or intellectual capacity was impaired, so that their ability to exercise appropriate judgment or choice was incomplete;

(iii) justify special consideration in the case of offenders judged to be at the ""cross roads"": Osenkowski (1982) 5 A Crim R 394.

[274] To go further, and to accept the fact of drug addiction as a mitigating factor generally, would not be justified in principle. Moreover, it would involve an exercise in irresponsibility on the part of the Court, if it were understood as a message that committing the crime of armed robbery to feed a drug habit is less deserving of censure than would otherwise be the case.

[275] The legislature has, by the heavy maximum penalty prescribed for armed robbery, spoken clearly in relation to this offence. Drug dependent persons should not be encouraged, as a class, to think that they are free to engage in serious criminal conduct of whatever kind with impunity, or with any hope of favourable treatment because they are able to show that they needed money through their addiction.

[276] In summary, I see no reason to depart from the planks of punishment, retribution and rehabilitation that underlie the sentencing process generally, and that permit of individualised sentencing by reference to the objective and subjective circumstances of each case.”


	
	The Crown further submitted that the sentencing judge’s error in finding that the respondent had “mental problems” was, in effect, compounded by the further error of using that finding in a way which was contrary to the principles set out by Wood CJ at CL in Henry, and which afforded leniency to the respondent on the basis of his prior illicit drug use. In oral argument before this Court, the Crown submitted that even if the primary error relied upon in support of ground 1 was not made out, his Honour’s use of the finding that he made was nevertheless erroneous and supported the Crown’s position in respect of grounds 2, 3 and 4.
	


Submissions of the Respondent


	
	Senior counsel for the respondent submitted that it had been open to his Honour to accept the evidence of Professor Woods, and that such evidence supported his conclusion as to the respondent’s mental state.
	
	
	It was further submitted that the Crown’s position in respect of ground 1 reflected a misunderstanding of the judgment of Wood CJ at CL in Henry. It was submitted that his Honour’s observations in that case were authority for the proposition that (inter alia) those who commit offences to feed a drug addiction cannot rely upon such addiction as a mitigating factor on sentence. Senior counsel submitted that no such issue arose in the present case. It was submitted that nothing in his Honour’s judgment indicated that he had used the evidence of the respondent’s prior drug use as a mitigating factor in any event.
	


Consideration


	
	In my view, there are a number of difficulties arising from the way in which the Crown articulated its position in support of this ground.
	
	
	Firstly, the terms of ground 1 sought to challenge a factual finding by the sentencing judge that the respondent had “mental problems”. The Crown’s submissions tended to conflate this factual finding with the use to which that finding was ultimately put by the sentencing judge. The two matters were completely separate. Only the first properly related to ground 1.
	
	
	Secondly, fundamental to the Crown’s submission was the proposition that if the respondent did suffer from mental problems, such problems were secondary to his illicit drug use. That submission ignores the evidence of Professor Woods. As set out at [24] above Professor Woods diagnosed four separate forms of mental illness. The first (and by inference the second) were in remission. The third and fourth were not. Even more significantly, Professor Woods’ opinion was that the third and fourth conditions were not, as the Crown submitted, secondary to the use of illicit drugs at all. Rather, they were attributable to a variety of other factors. Professor Woods’ opinions in these respects were largely unchallenged. The sentencing judge was entitled to, and did, accept them. They formed the basis of his finding that the respondent had mental problems. The Crown failed to demonstrate any error at all on the part of the sentencing judge in reaching that finding.
	
	
	Thirdly, the Crown’s submission that the resolution of this ground invited application of the principles articulated by Wood CJ at CL in Henry was based upon the erroneous proposition that the respondent’s mental state was secondary to his drug taking. It was not put to the sentencing judge that the respondent was entitled to rely upon his drug addiction as a mitigating factor in the sense to which Wood CJ at CL referred. The sentencing judge made no such finding. The principles articulated by Wood CJ at CL in Henry are simply not engaged.
	
	
	For all of these reasons, ground 1 is not made out.
	


Ground 2 – His Honour erred by finding that the offender’s mental problems moderated the need for general deterrence.

Ground 3 – His Honour erred by finding the offender’s mental problems moderated the need for specific deterrence.

Ground 4 – His Honour erred by finding that the offender’s mental problems were relevant to an assessment of the impact of a custodial sentence.

The findings of the sentencing judge


	
	The findings of the sentencing judge which are relevant to these grounds are set out in [28] and [29] above.
	


Submissions of the Crown


	
	The Crown submitted that it was not open to the sentencing judge to conclude that the respondent’s mental problems moderated the need for general or specific deterrence. Again, it was submitted that Professor Woods’ evidence was to the effect that the entirety of the respondent’s mental health issues were secondary to his drug taking. It was further submitted that any mental health issues had resolved, and that the only remaining issue was the trauma experienced by the respondent as a consequence of his own offending behaviour.
	
	
	It was further submitted that there was no evidence before the sentencing judge that the respondent suffered from ongoing mental problems which would make more difficult for him to serve a custodial sentence.
	
	
	Finally, the Crown submitted that in these circumstances his Honour “must have found” that there was some causal connection between the respondent’s mental illness and his offending. Implicit in that submission, although not specifically put, was the proposition that such a finding was an error.
	


Submissions of the respondent


	
	Senior counsel for the respondent submitted that the errors for which the Crown contended were not made out. It was submitted, in particular, that it was evident from the reference to De La Rosa that his Honour was aware of the relevant principles governing the relevance of mental illness on sentence, and that he applied them correctly.
	
	
	It was further submitted that his Honour’s findings as to the respondent’s mental illness were supported by the oral evidence of Professor Woods set out at [26] above, who drew a causal connection between such mental illness and the offending.
	


Consideration


	
	Once again there are a number of difficulties with the way in which the Crown put its position in support of these grounds.
	
	
	Firstly, for the reasons I have already stated, the proposition that the respondent’s mental illness was secondary to his drug taking, as well as the proposition that the respondent’s mental health issues had resolved, must be rejected. Both ignore the unchallenged evidence of Professor Woods which the sentencing judge accepted.
	
	
	Secondly, when dealing with this issue the sentencing judge made specific reference to the decision of McClellan CJ at CL in Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194 at [177]:
	


“[177] Where an offender is suffering from a mental illness, intellectual handicap or other mental problems the courts have developed principles to be applied when sentencing: see, eg, R v Engert (1995) 84 A Crim R 67; R v Tsiarias [1996] 1 VR 398 at 400; R v Fahda [1999] NSWCCA 267 at [40]-[48]; Lauritsen v R [2000] WASCA 203 ; (2000) 114 A Crim R 333 at [43]-[51]; R v Harb [2001] NSWCCA 249 at [35]-[45]; R v Israil [2002] NSWCCA 255; R v Hemsley [2004] NSWCCA 228 at [33]-[36]; R v Verdins [2007] VSCA 102 at [32]; Courtney v R [2007] NSWCCA 195 at [14]-[18]; and R v Henry [2007] NSWCCA 90 at [28]. They can be summarised in the following manner:

Where the state of a person's mental health contributes to the commission of the offence in a material way, the offender's moral culpability may be reduced. Consequently the need to denounce the crime may be reduced with a reduction in the sentence: R v Henry [1999] NSWCCA 111; 46 NSWLR 346 at [254]; Miller v R [1999] WASCA 66 at [23]; R v Jiminez [1999] WASCA 7 at [23], [25]; Tsiaras at 400; Lauritsen at [51]; Israil at [23]; R v Pearson [2004] NSWCCA 129 at [43]; Henry at [28].

It may also have the consequence that an offender is an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence resulting in a reduction in the sentence which would otherwise have been imposed: Engert at 71; R v Wright (1997) 93 A Crim R 48 at 50-51; Israil at [22]; Pearson at [42]; Henry at [28].

It may mean that a custodial sentence may weigh more heavily on the person. Because the sentence will be more onerous for that person the length of the prison term or the conditions under which it is served may be reduced: Tsiaris at 400; Jiminez at [25]; Israil at [26]; Henry at [28].

It may reduce or eliminate the significance of specific deterrence: Courtney at [14]; Tsiaras at 400; Israil at [25]; JW at [192].

Conversely, it may be that because of a person's mental illness, they present more of a danger to the community. In those circumstances, considerations of specific deterrence may result in an increased sentence: Israil at [24]; Henry at [28]. Where a person has been diagnosed with an Antisocial Personality Disorder there may be a particular need to give consideration to the protection of the public: R v Lawrence (2005) NSWCCA 91 per Spigelman CJ at [23]-[24].

[178] I should stress that the mental health problems of an offender need not amount to a serious psychiatric illness before they will be relevant to the sentencing process. The circumstances may indicate that when an offender has a mental disorder of modest severity it may nevertheless be appropriate to moderate the need for general or specific deterrence: R v Skura [2004] VSCA 53; R v Verdins [2007] VSCA 102; (2007) 16 VR 269 at [5].”


	
	Having referred to these passages, the sentencing judge found (at ROS 19) that the respondent’s mental illness warranted the moderation of general and specific deterrence. Although his Honour did not specifically say so, it may be inferred that he found a causal connection between the respondent’s mental state and his offending. Those findings do not reflect error. They were supported by the evidence of Professor Woods and they reflected a correct application of the principles set out by McClellan CJ at CL in De La Rosa.  Having found that the respondent suffered from mental problems, it was open to his Honour to find that such problems would have some impact on any custodial sentence which was imposed.
	
	
	Further, and to the extent that the Crown’s submission might have suggested otherwise, an offender’s mental state may remain relevant to sentence even in the absence of some causal link between such mental state and the relevant offending: Iskandar v R [2013] NSWCCA 235 at [30] per the Court (Beazley JA, R A Hulme and Bellew JJ).
	
	
	Finally, in light of the matters discussed in respect of ground 5 below concerning the degree of the respondent’s rehabilitation, it was open to his Honour to find that considerations of personal deterrence were similarly moderated.
	
	
	For all of these reasons, grounds 2, 3 and 4 are not made out.
	


Ground 5 – The sentences, individually and in total, are manifestly inadequate

Submissions of the Crown


	
	The Crown submitted that the sentences imposed at first instance reflected little weight having been given to general deterrence.
	
	
	In terms of the offending in sequences 1, 3 and 4, it was submitted that the respondent’s behaviour was consistent with someone who had “preyed” on the victim. It was submitted that the objective seriousness of the offending was reflected in the respondent:
	



	
	setting upon the victim;
	
	
	directing her to comply with sexual demands;
	
	
	acting violently towards her and causing injury;
	
	
	engaging in three separate and distinct forms of sexual intercourse;
	
	
	ejaculating, thereby exposing the victim to the possibility of pregnancy and the possibility of acquiring a sexually transmitted disease.
	



	
	The Crown submitted that the robbery offence in sequence 2 involved a vicious attack which targeted the victim’s head with a knife. The Crown also submitted, in respect of the overall sentence, that partial accumulation was insufficient to properly reflect the totality of the respondent’s offending.
	
	
	Finally, the Crown submitted that the sentencing judge had afforded excessive weight to the issue of delay. It was submitted that the delay between the offending (in 2004 and 2006) and the respondent being charged (in 2011) was a consequence of the respondent “keeping quiet” about what he had done. It was submitted that in these circumstances it was not open to rely upon that delay as a mitigating factor.
	


Submissions of the respondent


	
	Senior counsel for the respondent acknowledged that the offending was objectively serious. However, he submitted that in all of the circumstances the Crown had not established that the sentences imposed were unreasonable or plainly unjust. In advancing that submission, senior counsel relied upon a number of factors.
	
	
	Firstly, in terms of general deterrence, senior counsel repeated the submission (which I have previously accepted in my consideration of grounds 2, 3 and 4) that it was open to the sentencing judge to conclude that considerations of general deterrence should be moderated in view of the respondent’s mental illness.
	
	
	Secondly, it was submitted that specific deterrence was a matter of limited relevance, given the degree of the respondent’s rehabilitation.
	
	
	Thirdly, it was submitted that the relevance of delay on sentence necessarily differed according to the circumstances of a particular case. It was submitted that in the present case, the respondent had undergone total rehabilitation during the period of the delay and that this was clearly a powerful mitigating factor.
	
	
	Fourthly, reliance was placed on the finding of the sentencing judge that none of the offending was planned and was in fact opportunistic.
	
	
	Finally, it was submitted that the present case called for the application of a significant degree of understanding and flexibility in determining sentence, particularly in view of the respondent’s mental illness and his achieved level of rehabilitation.
	


Consideration


	
	There is force in the Crown’s submission as to the objective seriousness of the respondent’s offending. The offending in sequences 1, 3 and 4 involved the commission of separate and distinct acts of forced sexual intercourse, accompanied by degrading commands being made of the victim with which she was forced to comply out of fear for her safety. Significantly, the victim suffered physical injury as a consequence of the offending. However I am not able to accept the Crown’s submission in committing these offences the respondent had “preyed” on the victim. Such a submission suggests some degree of pre-meditation. That suggestion runs completely contrary to his Honour’s uncontested finding that the entirety of the offending was opportunistic.
	
	
	The robbery offence in sequence 2 was also serious. It involved a completely random and unprovoked attack on a shopkeeper who suffered serious injury as the result of an attack with a knife.
	
	
	I am unable to accept the Crown’s submission that the sentences imposed reflect insufficient weight being given to considerations of general deterrence. For the reasons previously stated, there was no error in his Honour’s conclusions regarding the respondent’s mental illness. That mental illness lessened the significance of general deterrence on sentence. It should also be pointed out that the sentencing judge did not find that general deterrence was of no weight at all. Rather, he concluded that the need for it was moderated in the circumstances of this case.
	
	
	One of the most significant factors in terms of determining sentence in the present case was the rehabilitation undertaken by the respondent during the period between the offending and his arrest. His uncontested evidence was that at the time of sentence he had been drug free for 5 years. He was in a stable relationship with his partner who, when giving evidence before the sentencing judge, expressed her unequivocal support for the respondent, variously describing him as an “amazing individual” and a “good man”.
	
	
	His Honour effectively found (at ROS 14) that the respondent’s rehabilitation was total and complete. Before this Court the Crown did not cavil with that proposition. That finding necessarily meant that considerations of specific deterrence were of less significance than might otherwise have been the case. His Honour also concluded (at ROS 17) that the respondent was deeply contrite, a sentiment that the respondent himself expressed when giving evidence.
	
	
	In advancing the submission that the sentencing judge had given excessive weight to the delay which had occurred between the offending and the respondent being charged, the Crown relied upon the decision of this Court in R v Kay [2004] NSWCCA 130. In that case, the relevant offending had been detected as a result of DNA matching some 13 months after the offending, a substantially shorter period than that in the present case. McColl JA, with whom Hidden and Levine JJ agreed, made reference (at [23]-[25]) to the decision of this Court in R v Todd [1982] 2 NSWLR 517, and to the decision of the High Court in Mill v R [1998] HCA 70; (1988) 166 CLR 59. Both cases considered the effect of delay on sentence where such delay was caused by the operation of the criminal justice system.
	
	
	In Todd Street CJ said (at 519):
	


“ … where there has been a lengthy postponement, whetherdue to an interstate sentence or otherwise, fairness to the prisoner requiresweight to be given to the progress of his rehabilitation during the term of hisearlier sentence, to the circumstance that he has been left in a state ofuncertain suspense as to what will happen to him when in due course hecomes up for sentence on the subsequent occasion, and to the fact thatsentencing for a stale crime, long after the committing of the offences, callsfor a considerable measure of understanding and flexibility of approach —passage of time between offence and sentence, when lengthy, will often leadto considerations of fairness to the prisoner in his present situation playing a

dominant role in the determination of what should be done in the matter of sentence; at times this can require what might otherwise be a quite undue degree of leniency being extended to the prisoner.”


	
	The decision in Todd was referred to by the plurality (Wilson, Deane, Dawson, Toohey and Gaudron JJ) in Mill v R (at 66):
	


“The long deferment of the trial or punishment of an offender, with the consequent uncertainty as to what will happen to him, raise considerations of fairness to an offender which must be taken into consideration when the second court is determining an appropriate head sentence.”


	
	In distinguishing those decisions, McColl JA said (at [33]):
	


“… the applicant was content to remain silent, hoping, presumably, that his association with the October 2001 offence would not be detected. Having remained silent, he now argues that he ought, in effect, be rewarded for his successful concealment of his commission of the offence by a substantially reduced or even deferred sentence. The authorities make plain that the significance of the delay will turn on the circumstances of each case. In my view the circumstances of this case do not attract the Todd principle”.


	
	In the present case, the respondent did not submit to the sentencing judge that the delay was attributable to the criminal justice system and that it should be taken into account because it had caused him stress and anxiety. Accordingly, as was the case in Kay, the circumstances of the present case did not attract application of what McColl JA referred to as the “Todd principle”.
	
	
	Whether delay is relevant, and if so on what basis and to what extent, will depend on the circumstances. In my view, the submission made by senior counsel that the respondent’s complete rehabilitation was a powerful mitigating factor should be accepted. In particular, it should be emphasised that the respondent reported to Professor Woods that he had an incomplete memory of the sexual offending, and no memory at all of the robbery. Those propositions were not challenged when the respondent was cross-examined in the sentence proceedings. Accordingly, this was not a case in which the respondent, in the knowledge that he had offended, had deliberately remained silent, or had deliberately “hidden” himself from the authorities, between the time of his offending and the time of his arrest. Those circumstances are clearly distinguishable from those considered in Kay. 
	
	
	In order to succeed on the present appeal, the Crown must establish that they were unreasonable or plainly unjust: Dinsdale v R [2000] HCA 54; (2000) 202 CLR 321. The sentences should, in my view, be regarded as lenient. At the same time however, they reflect considerations which were specific to the present case.
	
	
	In particular, the sentences reflect the sentencing judge having reached a particular conclusion regarding the respondent’s mental state, and its effect upon the need for general deterrence. They also reflect his Honour having properly given significant weight to the respondent’s complete rehabilitation, and its effect upon the need for personal deterrence.
	
	
	In all of these circumstances, I am not persuaded that the sentences are unreasonable or plainly unjust.
	


ORDERS


	
	I propose the following order:
	



	
	The Crown appeal is dismissed.

		22 April 2015",2015-04-20 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2703549,ALS v R [2015] NSWCCA 70,"Judgment


	
	MACFARLAN JA: In August 2013 the appellant was convicted after a jury trial of an offence under the then s 67 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) that between 22 April 1974 and 21 April 1975 he carnally knew the complainant who was a person then under the age of 10 years. He was charged with the offence by an indictment dated 25 July 2013. The appellant had previously been convicted of the same offence by a judge sitting without a jury but the conviction was quashed and a new trial ordered ([2013] NSWCCA 63). The basis of those orders was that further evidence, arguably supporting the appellant’s case, had become available since the trial. This evidence comprised a letter written by the complainant and a video recording to which I refer below.
	
	
	The offence the subject of the charge was alleged to have occurred whilst the complainant was nine years old and to have involved penile vaginal intercourse. Evidence of other alleged sexual conduct of the appellant directed to the complainant was given as contextual evidence.
	
	
	The appellant’s first ground of appeal is that the verdict of guilty is “unreasonable, or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence”. This ground invokes s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) and requires the Court to undertake its own independent assessment of the evidence, both as to its sufficiency and its quality (SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; 243 CLR 400 at [14]). Having done this, the Court must determine whether it was open to the jury to conclude beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was guilty of the offence with which he was charged (ibid, [21]).
	
	
	The appellant has two other grounds of appeal but as I am of the view that he succeeds on his first ground, with the consequence that his conviction should be quashed and a verdict of acquittal entered, it is unnecessary to deal with those grounds.
	


THE EVIDENCE AT THE TRIAL

The complainant’s evidence


	
	The complainant was born in April 1965. She has a sister about 18 months older than her and a younger sister, all with the same father (not the appellant). When the complainant was about three years old her mother entered into a relationship with the appellant with whom she had another daughter.
	
	
	The complainant gave evidence that when she was about four years old, the appellant had the complainant and her older sister lie naked on a double bed in their home where he made them touch each other’s genitals and kiss each other whilst he masturbated. The complainant said that she was very scared about what had happened and that the appellant told her not to tell anyone. She obeyed that instruction because she was frightened of the appellant as he had previously hit her.
	
	
	The complainant also gave evidence that when she was about six years old, before the family moved house, the appellant would come into her room about two or three times per week, wake her up, put his hands underneath the bed covers and touch her on the genitals, with the appellant sometimes putting his finger inside her. This occurred in the complainant’s bedroom which she shared with her older sister.
	
	
	The complainant gave evidence that there were occasions when the appellant hit her and, after the family moved house, when the appellant acting violently towards the complainant’s mother.
	
	
	The complainant said that at this house also the appellant used to come into her room at night and touch her genitals. This occurred in a room that she shared with her two sisters and in a bed that she shared with her older sister.
	
	
	The complainant gave evidence of an occasion when she was nine years old (being that the subject of the charge against the appellant) when the appellant asked the complainant’s mother if the complainant could stay home and help him in the garden whilst the rest of the family went on a shopping trip. She said that the appellant took her into a bedroom, removed her shorts and underwear, but left her top on, and removed his own shorts and underwear. She said that he started to touch her, that his penis was erect and that he said “when I put this in you, I’m going to split you in half”. At the time, the appellant’s father was watching television in an adjacent room with the volume turned up because he was very hard of hearing. There was no door separating the two rooms. The complainant sought to deter the appellant by saying that she thought she heard his father but he proceeded to have penile vaginal intercourse with her.
	
	
	The complainant said that she told her mother what had happened when her mother returned home, with the result that her mother confronted the appellant. An argument ensued during which the appellant said that the complainant had made up the allegation. The complainant’s sisters were present at the time. The appellant then took the complainant into another room and flogged her severely. The following day, the complainant found out that her mother had asked the appellant to leave the home. He returned after about two weeks but did not touch her in a sexual way again.
	
	
	The complainant gave evidence that when she was about 14 years old she told her school counsellor what had happened to her. She said that the counsellor left the room for about 15 minutes and when she came back she told the complainant that she had contacted the complainant’s parents and told them what the complainant had said. The counsellor told her that her parents had said she was going to be in trouble when she got home because she had made it up. When she returned home, the complainant received a “belting” from the appellant.
	
	
	When she was 17 years old, the complainant moved out of home. Prior to moving out she had a “big” argument with the appellant because he would not let her go out on the weekend. She told him she was leaving and he slapped her across the face.
	
	
	The complainant had limited contact with her mother in the following two years and only on occasions when she was sure that the appellant would not be present. After an argument with her mother when she was 19 years old, the complainant decided not to have any further contact with her.
	
	
	In 2008, the complainant commenced making notes about what had happened to her and in September 2008 she made a statement to the police. In June 2010, at the instigation of the police, she had a lawfully recorded telephone conversation with the appellant in which she told him that she was seeing a counsellor and that what he had done had a big impact on her life. The appellant denied that he had ever sexually assaulted or molested the complainant.
	


The photograph, postcards, letter and video evidence


	
	A photograph taken at the wedding in 1995 of one of the complainant’s sisters was tendered at trial. It showed the complainant in a family group, posing for the photograph with her hand placed upon the appellant’s chest in an apparently friendly fashion. The complainant gave evidence that the photographer told her to place her hand in that position.
	
	
	Also tendered were a number of postcards and a letter written by the complainant to her mother and the appellant whilst she was in Queensland when aged about 20 or 21 years. The postcards were affectionate in tone, were addressed to “Dear Mum and Dad” and signed with “love” or “all my love”, and one said “PS please write”. A three-page letter written by the complainant referred to the appellant as “Dad” and said “I wish I could come down to say hello at Christmas” and “I miss you all very much now, and am always thinking of you”. In another letter addressed to “Dear Dad” and signed “all my love”, the complainant wrote “Dad could you please write a letter to me and tell me what’s happening down there” and suggested that the appellant “should come up here and fish the marlin”.
	
	
	In video recordings of her sister’s 1995 wedding, the complainant appears spontaneously to rub or touch the appellant’s back in an affectionate manner and to squeeze his chin and pinch his chest.
	


The complainant’s inheritance 


	
	A Statement of Agreed Facts in evidence recorded that in 1962, the complainant’s mother had transferred to her mother an entitlement that she would otherwise have had in respect of the estate of her late father. Her mother died in 1995 leaving her estate to be divided equally between her grandchildren, subject to a life tenancy in favour of her de facto partner, thus excluding the complainant’s mother.
	
	
	After her mother’s partner died in June 2009, the complainant’s mother commenced proceedings in the Supreme Court claiming that she had not been properly provided for by her mother. In 2011 a Deed of Family Arrangement brought the court proceedings to an end. Under the Deed, the complainant and her three sisters received about $29,000 each and their mother received $75,000.
	


The evidence of the complainant’s sisters


	
	The complainant’s older sister and the sister next after the complainant in age gave evidence about what occurred at the wedding in 1995. The complainant’s older sister said that the relationship between the appellant and the complainant was “very strained” at the wedding (Transcript p 73). Neither sister gave evidence of sexual misconduct on the part of the appellant and the complainant’s older sister said that she had “no recollection” of the incident referred to at [6] above.
	


The evidence of the complainant’s mother


	
	The complainant’s mother gave evidence that she never left the appellant alone with her daughters or with the complainant and that the complainant never spoke to her about sexual misconduct on the part of the appellant. She said that the appellant could not have gotten up during the night and gone into the complainant’s room without her knowing. In addition, she denied that she had ever received a call from a school counsellor concerning any complaints made by the complainant, and said that on no occasion did she ask the appellant to leave the home.
	


The school counsellor


	
	A police officer gave evidence that the complainant’s school no longer had any records of the complainant’s dealings with the school counsellor as student records had been destroyed after eight years. He also gave evidence of a letter from the manager of student counselling employed by the Department of Education and Training which stated that inquiries had been made with the counsellor who was employed at the school at the relevant time and she had no recollection of a student by the name of the complainant.
	


The appellant’s evidence


	
	The appellant gave evidence and denied that he had engaged in any sexual misconduct in relation to the complainant. He had made a similar denial in his earlier interview with the police, which was in evidence at the trial. In that interview, the appellant said that the complainant was motivated to make false complaints by the dispute concerning her grandmother’s will and the prospect of losing her share in her grandmother’s estate (see [19]-[20] above).
	


RESOLUTION OF THE APPEAL


	
	Having conducted an independent assessment of the evidence at the trial, I have a reasonable doubt as to the appellant’s guilt of the offence of which he was convicted. I consider that it is a doubt that the jury ought also to have experienced and do not consider that the fact that the jury did not have it is explicable by the jury’s advantage in seeing and hearing the witnesses at trial (SKA v The Queen at [13] citing M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; 181 CLR 487 at 494).
	
	
	I emphasise that none of the factors to which I will now refer is alone decisive. Rather, my conclusion was arrived at on the basis of the combined effect of the following matters.
	
	
	First, the complainant’s evidence was not corroborated in any material respect.
	
	
	The complainant’s older sister, whom the complainant said was involved in the incident referred to at [6] above, was called to give evidence but did not depose to any recollection supportive of the complainant’s evidence in that regard, despite the incident having been likely, on the complainant’s description, to have been traumatic and therefore not easily forgotten. The fact that she is 18 months older than the complainant could be expected to have increased the likelihood of her remembering such an incident.
	
	
	Furthermore, that sister gave no evidence supportive of the complainant’s account of the repeated sexual misconduct of the appellant in a bedroom that the complainant shared with that sister and, as to part of it, in the bed that she shared with her.
	
	
	Likewise, the younger sister of the complainant who gave evidence did not give any evidence in support of the complainant’s account of the appellant’s sexual misconduct, despite the fact that, on the complainant’s evidence, this occurred repeatedly over a substantial period in a room that that sister (who was two years younger than the complainant) also shared with the complainant.
	
	
	The complainant’s mother did not corroborate the complainant’s evidence in any way. Indeed, she denied knowledge of any complaints made by the complainant concerning sexual abuse by the appellant, including that which the complainant said she made to the school counsellor and which she said was passed on to her mother and the appellant. Her evidence remains significant in this context notwithstanding that there were other aspects of her evidence that should reasonably have caused the jury to entertain doubts about her evidence generally. I refer in particular to her adamant evidence, first, that despite the appellant living with her and her daughters for many years, there were no occasions at all when the appellant was left with the care of the four daughters or with the complainant alone and, secondly, that it was not possible for the appellant ever to have gotten out of bed during the night and gone into the complainant’s room without her knowing (Transcript p 91).
	
	
	Nor was the complainant’s evidence concerning what must have been, on her evidence, a particularly noteworthy occasion even for the school counsellor, corroborated by that counsellor.
	
	
	Secondly, the postcards, letter and video evidence referred to in [17] and [18] above appear to contradict the complainant’s evidence of deep-seated ill-will on her part towards the appellant. The complainant gave evidence that she hated the appellant, that she has trouble being in the same room with him and that she would not willingly have physical contact with him (Transcript p 40). Her explanation for the postcards and letter to the effect that her mother told her to write them is difficult to reconcile with the number of communications and the warmth of their tone. So too is her evidence that she wrote to her mother and the appellant in order to “keep the peace”, in the hope that they would accept her and her partner, and the family could reconcile (Transcript pp 55 (first trial), 27 (second trial)).
	
	
	Likewise, the video recording referred to in [18] above appears to demonstrate the existence of affection on the part of the complainant towards the appellant which is inconsistent with her evidence. Her explanations of that conduct in cross-examination were varied and unconvincing. For instance, she stated that she was in fact “strangling” the appellant and that she did not want to ruin her sister’s wedding by causing any trouble (Transcript pp 51, 54). That evidence did not correspond with the seemingly comfortable interactions between the complainant and appellant depicted by the video recording, and the spontaneous physical contact which she appeared to initiate with him.
	
	
	I add that I have not attached any significance to the family photograph in which the complainant has her hand on the appellant’s chest (see [16] above). The complainant’s explanation that the photographer told her to put her hand there seemed credible and derived support from the testimony of both sisters who were called to give evidence (Transcript pp 71, 77).
	
	
	Thirdly, there are at least two aspects of the complainant’s description of the incident that was the subject of the charge against the appellant (see [10] above) that raise questions about its veracity. In particular, the description of it occurring within a few metres of the appellant’s father, who was watching television in the adjacent room where no door intervened between him and his son who was having sexual intercourse with a semi-naked nine year old girl, is not easy to accept. Although the appellant’s father was hard of hearing, there was no suggestion that he had any difficulties with his sight or that he was too old to appreciate what was going on if he observed it. The absence in the complainant’s account of any reference to the pain which one would have expected a nine year old girl to experience as a result of sexual intercourse with an adult male, is also significant.
	
	
	Fourthly, the appellant gave evidence and denied the charge in a way that did not appear, on reading the transcript, to have any obvious lack of credibility about it. His evidence accorded with the answers he had given to the police in his recorded interview with them and with the vociferous denials he made when the complainant telephoned him at the instigation of the police, the appellant being unaware that the call was being recorded.
	
	
	Before finalising this judgment, I had the advantage of reading the judgment of Fullerton J in draft form. I have considered the matters to which her Honour refers but nevertheless remain of the opinion that the appeal should be allowed. Her Honour gives reasons why the passage of almost 40 years between the dates of the alleged offences and the trial rendered it difficult for the Crown to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt. That is undoubtedly so but the fact remains that no evidence corroborative of the complainant’s evidence was able to be called. The existence of reasons for the absence of such evidence does not fill that lacuna. Furthermore, even if the jury considered the matters to which her Honour refers in relation to the complainant’s mother’s evidence to be well-founded, the mother’s evidence, negative as it was to the Crown case, does not become evidence that provides positive support for it.
	
	
	Moreover, I do not consider that the complainant adequately explained her correspondence with the appellant and the wedding video. On my assessment, that evidence stands in conflict with her evidence of her relationship with the appellant. Certainly, when considered in conjunction with the other matters to which I have referred, I consider that it raises a reasonable doubt as to the appellant’s guilt. This is not a doubt that is in my opinion capable of being dispelled by recognition of the jury’s advantage in observing the manner in which the witnesses gave their evidence (M v The Queen at 494-5; Lachlan Wilson v R [2014] NSWCCA 266 at [161]). As required by M v The Queen at 493 (approved in SKA at [11]), I have formed my view upon the whole of the evidence. I am left with the conclusion that “there is a significant possibility that an innocent person has been convicted” (M v The Queen at 494; MFA v The Queen [2002] HCA 53; 213 CLR 606 at [95]-[96]; SKA at [14]).
	


ORDERS


	
	For the reasons I have given, I consider that the verdict of the jury is unreasonable and cannot be supported having regard to the evidence. It is not necessary to grant the appellant leave to appeal as he was entitled to appeal as of right on the two other grounds (which I have found it unnecessary to deal with) which he advanced. I propose the following orders:
	



	
	Appeal allowed.
	
	
	Quash the appellant’s conviction on the charge contained in the indictment against him dated 25 July 2013.
	
	
	Enter a verdict of acquittal on that charge.
	



	
	FULLERTON J: I have had the advantage of reading in draft the judgment of Macfarlan JA and his Honour’s reasons for concluding that, upon the whole of the evidence at the appellant’s trial, it was not open to the jury to convict him of the carnal knowledge of the complainant and that the conviction on that count should be quashed and a verdict of acquittal entered.
	
	
	I have also read the draft judgment of Bellew J in which he expresses his agreement with Macfarlan JA’s reasons for concluding that the jury’s verdict could not be supported having regard to the evidence, and his agreement with the orders his Honour proposes.
	
	
	In compliance with the principled approach to an appeal under s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act, I have undertaken my own assessment of the evidence led at the appellant’s retrial, both as to its sufficiency and quality. I have also taken into account what I consider to be the inferences available to be drawn from the facts established by that evidence that both support the Crown case and those that undermine it. In the result, I have come to the conclusion that, despite all matters properly put in issue in the trial, it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the appellant’s guilt and that the first ground of appeal should be dismissed.
	
	
	For that reason, it will be necessary for me to consider the second and third grounds of appeal, filed as supplementary grounds after the Crown’s submissions in answer to the first ground of appeal were filed. The Crown filed supplementary submissions to address the supplementary grounds.
	
	
	Both the second and third grounds of appeal relate to what is said to be the Crown’s breach of the rule in Browne v Dunn (1893) 6 R 67 when, in closing submissions, the trial advocate urged the jury to accept that the complainant made an immediate complaint to her mother after she was sexually assaulted by the appellant, in support of his further submission that the jury would find the complainant an honest and reliable witness, but had failed to challenge the evidence of the complainant's mother as untrue when she denied that her daughter had complained to her.
	


The first ground of appeal: The verdict of guilty was unreasonable, or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence.


	
	The obligation of the Court in considering whether a verdict of a jury is unreasonable is the subject of settled principle. The question the Court must ask itself was restated in SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; 243 CLR 400. The majority (French CJ, Gummow and Kiefel JJ) held at [11] that, in conformity with the approach by Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ in M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; 181 CLR 487 at 493, the question is:
	


… whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty.


	
	In Sami Kurdi v R [2011] NSWCCA 179, Bathurst CJ said at [8] that in order to comply with M v The Queen:
	


… it is necessary for the Court to review the whole of the evidence available to the jury. That is not to say that a court of appeal conducts its own trial. The question which it must answer is whether it was open to the jury to reach the verdict which it in fact reached. Further, as was pointed out in M v The Queen supra, the Court must pay full regard to the primacy of the jury as the fact-finding tribunal and to the fact that the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the evidence.


	
	The primacy of the jury is of particular importance in a case where, as here, without corroboration of the complainant’s evidence, the jury’s assessment of her reliability and credibility as a witness depended upon the opportunity they had (which this Court does not enjoy) of viewing her give her evidence, including, importantly, her demeanour under cross-examination (see GL v R [2014] NSWCCA 68 at [129]).
	
	
	The primacy of the jury’s position as fact finders is of additional importance in this case given the opportunity they had to see and hear the complainant’s mother give evidence denying that her daughter reported being sexually assaulted by the appellant; denying that her daughter informed a school counsellor in 1984 that she had been sexually abused by him; denying that they attended at the school in response to that allegation; and denying that the appellant physically assaulted the complainant in retribution for making the complaint. The jury also had the opportunity of considering the demeanour of the complainant’s mother when she denied that the appellant was ever left at home alone with the complainant (or any of her daughters) and denied that he physically disciplined the complainant in the ways she described in her evidence. The jury also had the opportunity of making their assessment of her evidence in circumstances where she admitted she was the victim of repeated domestic violence at the hand of the appellant but that she had never complained to police about his mistreatment of her.
	
	
	In undertaking my own evaluative review of the evidence, I have also taken into account that the Crown case suffered from the deficiencies of proof frequently encountered in a case where an adult alleges s/he was sexually abused as a child. In this case, almost 40 years had elapsed from the date of the offence, particularised in the indictment as between dates in 1974 and 1975 when the complainant was aged nine, and the sexual and other abuse she claimed to have suffered as a child before that assault, and the appellant’s first trial in 2013, five years after the complainant first reported the matter to police in September 2008 at a time when she was aged 33.
	
	
	In this case, the passage of years not only attracted a Longman direction (Longman v The Queen [1989] HCA 60; 168 CLR 79) but also had the potential to deprive the Crown case of evidence corroborative of the complainant’s evidence - a deficiency in the Crown case to which both Macfarlan JA referred at [27] and Bellew J referred at [123] in reasoning to the conclusion that the jury’s verdict was unreasonable.
	
	
	The high school the complainant attended in 1979 when, at age 14, she said she told a school counsellor that she had been sexually abused by the appellant, was unable to produce any record of the complaint (assuming one were made) or the attendance of the appellant and her mother at the counsellor’s invitation (assuming that invitation was extended and they attended), since the school routinely destroyed its student records after eight years. In addition, after this Court overturned the appellant’s conviction on fresh evidence grounds in 2013 following a judge alone trial in 2012 (ALS v R [2013] NSWCCA 63), and after additional enquiries by the police identified the counsellor who was apparently associated with the school, she told police she had no recollection of the complainant by her name. A police officer gave evidence to that effect at the appellant’s trial.
	
	
	The complainant’s grandmother died in 1995. The complainant gave evidence that she sought and gained solace and protection from her grandmother. Although the complainant did not give evidence that she told her grandmother that the appellant had ever sexually abused her, on the day of the sexual assault charged on the indictment, and after she said she was beaten by the appellant for complaining to her mother that he had sexually assaulted her whilst her mother and her sisters were away from the house, her grandmother removed her from her parents’ house.
	
	
	These observations are, of course, collateral to the enquiry whether I consider that upon the whole of the evidence that was led at trial it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the Crown proved the appellant’s guilt. That said, the fact that the complainant’s grandmother was not available to be called as a witness is not unimportant given that the complainant’s evidence that she was routinely physically disciplined by the appellant, sometimes by thrashing her with his belt, was also denied by him and by the complainant’s mother.
	
	
	The complainant’s older sister by eighteen months (referred to in the evidence as “K”), gave evidence in the Crown case. She was not asked whether she witnessed the complainant being physically assaulted by the appellant with a belt or in the other ways the complainant deposed to in her evidence. Neither was it put to her in cross-examination that this did not happen. She did give evidence, however, that she had no recollection of being the victim of the indecent assault involving herself and K as detailed by the complainant in her evidence and relied upon by the Crown as relationship evidence.
	
	
	Despite the fact that the complainant’s evidence (both of the act of sexual intercourse charged as a breach of the then s 67 of the Crimes Act and the evidence she gave of other indecent assaults led as context evidence) was uncorroborated, I remain of the opinion that it was open to the jury to be left in no doubt as to the appellant’s guilt. I have come to that conclusion despite the attack upon the complainant’s credibility and, in particular, despite the cross-examination which focused on the letters and cards she sent to the appellant and her mother many years after the sexual assault the subject of the charge on the indictment, and what is said to be her display of spontaneous and genuine affection for him at her sister’s wedding in 1995. The three excerpts of video footage of the wedding, and one letter additional to the letters and cards tendered at the appellant’s first trial, comprised the fresh evidence that resulted in a retrial being ordered by this Court in 2013.
	
	
	I have reviewed the transcript of evidence led at the appellant’s retrial for its sufficiency and quality, inclusive of the fresh evidence upon which the complainant was cross-examined at length, and the evidence of the complainant’s mother and the appellant, neither of whom gave evidence at the earlier trial. What follows is a summary of that evidence.
	


The complainant’s evidence


	
	I gratefully adopt the comprehensive summary of the complainant’s evidence summarised by Beech-Jones J at [11]-[42] in ALS v R [2013] NSWCCA 63, apparently extracted from the Crown Part A Summary prepared for the earlier appeal. The same summary was prepared by the Crown for this appeal. The complainant’s evidence in chief, cross-examination and re-examination at the first trial was before the jury at the appellant’s retrial pursuant to orders made under s 306B(1) of the Criminal Procedure Act.
	


Chronology of events

[10] ...

[11] TW was born in April 1965. The appellant formed a relationship with TW's mother sometime in the late 1960s. Initially he lived with TW's mother, TW and her two sisters, K and J, at their grandparents' house in Cardiff. When TW was four she, her mother, her sisters and the appellant moved to a house in Adamstown Heights. In 1972 the appellant and TW's mother had a daughter, A, being TW's half-sister.

[12] When TW was six they moved to a house in Merewether. It was at this house that the events the subject of the charge were said by TW to have occurred, although TW gave evidence of other uncharged acts by the appellant which were said to have placed the offence in context (see Steadman v R (No 1) [2013] NSWCCA 55 at [7] to [11] per Macfarlan JA). They were all denied by the appellant.

[13] In the late 1970s the family moved to Lambton Heights. Sometime around 1982 when TW was aged seventeen she left home. Around the age of nineteen she left the Newcastle area. It appears to have been common ground that she had little contact with the appellant or her mother until the mid-1990s although certain letters and postcards were sent by her which I refer to below. TW's half-sister, A, married in February 1995. TW attended the wedding.

[14] In June 1995 TW's maternal grandmother passed away. This touched off a dispute which the appellant claimed, and TW denied, was of significance to her in making the allegations against him (the ""will dispute""). The will dispute had its origins in 1962 when TW's mother transferred her entitlement under the estate of her late father to her mother, which included a home. In 1967 TW's grandmother made a will leaving all of her estate in equal portions to her grandchildren once they had reached 21 years of age. However their interests were subject to a life tenancy over her home granted to her de facto partner. When she died in 1995 the terms of the will became known and the life tenancy commenced. TW and her sisters were due to receive the remainder of the estate upon the tenant's death. Apparently from that time TW's mother began pressing her children to return some of the remainder of the estate to her. On 22 June 2009 the life tenant died and the contingent interests of the grandchildren crystallised. On 27 May 2010 Letters of Administration were granted. On 21 November 2010 TW's mother commenced proceedings. On 21 March 2011 those proceedings were settled in accordance with a deed. Under the deed TW's mother received $75,000.00 and each of her four daughters received $29,230.07.

[15] On 26 September 2008 TW provided a statement to the police. On 4 June 2010 TW telephoned the appellant. Pursuant to a warrant granted by this Court the conversation was recorded. In the conversation TW confronted him with accusations which he denied.

[16] On 17 June 2010 the appellant was arrested. He was taken to the police station and participated in an Electronically Recorded Interview with a Suspected Person (""ERISP""). The allegations concerning TW (as well as her sisters) were put to him and denied.

The Evidence at the Second Trial

[17] At the second trial the Crown called two witnesses: TW and one of the investigating Detectives, Senior Constable Evans. Senior Constable Evans confirmed the dates noted in [15] and [16]. He also stated that an approach was made to the principal of Lambton High School to ascertain if the school had any records concerning TW (see [30]), but was advised that records were destroyed after eight years. He also made an inquiry in relation to a particular school counsellor, but no records were available concerning her either (see [31]).

[18] The Crown tendered a recording of the ERISP, a transcript of the ERISP that edited out references to the accusations of K and J, as well as a recording and transcript of the telephone call between TW and the appellant on 4 June 2010. There were also agreed facts concerning the will dispute.

TW's evidence in chief - background and context evidence

[19] TW gave evidence of her personal background consistent with [11] to [12] above. She recalled that when she lived with her grandmother before she was four years old the appellant hit her with a belt or his hand on her bottom outside her clothes.

[20] TW recounted an incident after they moved to the house in Adamstown Heights in which the appellant made her and her sister sit on the double bed in her mother's bedroom. Both girls were naked and the appellant made them touch each other's genitals and kiss each other while he masturbated by rubbing his penis up and down. TW could not remember how she came to be naked in the room. The incident lasted for about five minutes, during which she did not say anything. No one was at home at the time and TW did not say anything afterwards because she was scared of the appellant as he had hit her previously.

[21] TW stated that the appellant used to come into the room which she shared with her sister at night. She said that about two to three times a week he would wake her up, place his hands underneath the covers and touch her on the genitals both outside of and inside her underpants. Sometimes he would put his finger inside her. He told her to be quiet and she remained so because she was too scared to say anything. She prepared a sketch of the layout of the house at Adamstown Heights which was tendered, depicting her and her sister's bedroom.

[22] TW stated that sometimes the appellant hit her with a belt, leaving big swollen lumps across her bottom and lower back. She was sent to her grandmother's place to recover. She said that the appellant also hit her very hard across her ear and head and she suffered partial hearing loss in her left ear as a result.

[23] TW stated that after they moved to the house in Merewether, the appellant continued to come into the room that she shared with her two sisters at night and touch her genitals. He told her to be quiet and she listened because she was terrified. She said that the appellant also frequently hit her with his hand and belt, which was doubled over a couple of times. He made her pull her underwear down and bend over one of the beds before hitting her with the belt.

[24] Often when the appellant came home from work he was drunk and bashed TW's mother, who as a result suffered bruises around her neck, face and wrists. TW said she was scared that the appellant would kill her mother. From the age of seven years she would sometimes punch him to help her mother. On one occasion the appellant responded by picking TW up and throwing her against a wall. On another occasion the appellant was bashing her mother and she ran next door and asked the neighbours to call the police. The police attended the house and the appellant stood at the front door with his arm up so that the police could not enter, and he told them that everything was all right. He would not let TW's mother speak and the children were told to go to their bedrooms.

TW's evidence in chief - the offence

[25] TW stated that when she was nine years old the appellant's father came to live with them at the house in Merewether. Sometime in the warmer months but before the Christmas holidays TW, her sisters and mother planned a shopping trip. Before they left, the appellant said ""[TW] can stay home with me and help in the garden and do some, like, work"". TW said she was very upset that the appellant had told her she was not allowed to go on the shopping trip. She cried and then went out the back to play. The appellant's father was still at home and watching the television with the sound blaring.

[26] The appellant told TW to come inside. He led her into her parents' bedroom and made her lay on the bed. He removed her underwear and shorts but left her top on. He removed his own shorts and underwear. He started to touch her and his penis was erect. He said to her ""[w]hen I put this in you, I'm going to split you in half"". When he said this, TW heard the television blaring and told him ""I think I hear granddad"". The appellant did not respond. He put his penis inside her vagina and moved it in and out. He had her legs spread and he was on his knees in front of her. TW said that she clenched her fists, held her arms up to her chest, turned away and closed her eyes. After a few minutes, the appellant removed his penis and told her that she could go.

[27] TW said she put on her underwear and shorts and went to the outside toilet, where she sat and cried until her mother and sister returned home. She waited until her mother went to the outside toilet, knocked at the door and asked if she could go in to speak to her. TW went inside the toilet and told her mother that the appellant ""had stuck his thing in me"" and said to her that ""he was going to split me in two"".

[28] TW could not recall what her mother said. She said her mother went inside the house and confronted the appellant. There was an argument and the appellant said that TW had made it all up. TW protested. The appellant took TW into her room, pulled down her pants and shorts, made her bend over and struck her six or seven times with his belt. TW suffered welts to her body as result. Later that day TW's grandmother took her away. She said that she did not tell her grandmother what the appellant had done because she was too scared.

[29] When TW returned the next day, she was surprised to learn that her mother had asked the appellant to leave. He left, but moved back into the house after about two weeks. TW's mother and the appellant did not discuss what had happened after this time. TW said that the appellant did not touch her in a sexual way again. However she thought that the appellant was treating her worse than before the incident. She said she was grounded all the time, had to do extra work and was not allowed to go out when her sisters were.

TW's evidence in chief - complaint and post-offence relations

[30] When TW was thirteen years old the family moved to Lambton Heights and she attended Lambton High School. Once, when she was fourteen years old, she became ill at school. An ambulance officer was called and she was sent home after being treated. Her mother took her to the hospital but when the doctors asked if something was troubling her, she felt that she could not reply because her mother and the appellant were in the room.

[31] In her evidence TW said that she had realised at school after a personal development class that what the appellant had done to her constituted sexual intercourse. TW told her school counsellor that the appellant had molested her from a young age and had sex with her when she was nine. She recalled that the counsellor left the room and when she returned said that she had spoken to her parents. The counsellor told her that her parents said that she had made it all up and that she would be in trouble when she got home. When TW arrived at home the appellant yelled at her and gave her a ""belting"". She said that as a result she was too scared to tell anyone else about what happened and did not think anyone could help her.

[32] TW left school after Year 10 but continued to live at home until she was seventeen years old. After moving out she did not have much contact with her mother as the appellant had told her not to see her mother or contact the florist shop they operated together. Nevertheless they maintained some contact, but when TW was nineteen she had an argument with her mother and decided not to have further contact with her.

[33] She moved away from Newcastle. She agreed that she did not ""have much contact with [her] family"" after she moved away. The next contact she recounted was being advised in 1995 that her grandmother had died and attending the funeral in Newcastle.

[34] TW said that sometime in 1995 or the year after she received a phone call from her mother and the appellant threatening that her mother would contest her grandmother's will if she did not sign over her 25% stake in her grandmother's house. TW said the phone call became heated and she said ""[how] dare youse ring me up after all these years and threaten me?"" She asked the appellant ""[w]ho are you molesting now?"", and said ""people like you just don't stop doing this"". She said that TW's mother and the appellant hung up the phone on the complainant. The complainant rang them back and asked the appellant again ""[w]ho are you molesting now?"" They hung up on her again. TW said that was the last contact she had with them.

[35] As I have said, TW made a statement to police on 26 September 2008. She said that prior to making that statement she kept notes on her experiences for around three months after speaking to a sexual assault counsellor. She said that she was motivated to do so by her depression and the effect of what had happened to her when she was a child. In addition, she said that she had just discovered the bodies of the family members of a friend, and had become a witness in that matter.

[36] Consistent with the defence case, it was put to TW that all of the events of abuse and violence that she said she suffered did not happen. She also confirmed that, after the argument with her mother when she was nineteen (see [32]), she resolved not to see her mother again.

[37]  In cross-examination TW was shown a bundle of documents which were tendered. One of those documents was a photograph taken at A's wedding in 1995. As I explain below, she identified herself as the woman with her hand on the appellant's torso in what appears to be a friendly gesture towards him.

[38]  TW was shown a postcard written by her to her mother and the appellant from North Queensland. She said that she thought the card had been written when she was 20 or 21 years old. She agreed that she wrote ""Dear Mum and Dad"" and signed off ""All my love, [TW]"". She said that she had never stopped loving her mother despite what happened.

[39]  TW was shown another postcard from the Gold Coast and two postcards stapled together from Cape Tribulation which TW said had been sent in a three to four month period when she was travelling with someone her mother and the appellant did not like. She agreed that the postcard started with ""Dear Dad and Mum"" and was signed off ""Love [TW]"" ""PS please write"".

[40]  She was also shown a three page letter written by her which included a reference to ""Dad"" (ie the appellant). She agreed that in it she wrote ""I wish I could come home to say hello at Christmas"", ""I miss you all very much now and am always thinking of you"", and on the last page ""[w]ell I love you all very much"" and ""PS Mum don't work to [sic] hard"". The complainant disagreed that the content of these items was inconsistent with what she had alleged in the proceedings.

[41]  In cross-examination the complainant denied that her entire motivation was her anger at the prospect of being deprived of her share in her grandmother's estate. She denied that she timed her statement so that it would coincide almost exactly with the death of her grandmother's surviving de facto partner on 22 June 2009 and the end of his life tenancy of the estate. She said that she knew he suffered from lung cancer but not that it was ""that bad"". She also denied that she had in effect carried out her threat to cause trouble if her mother challenged the will. It was put to her that during the conversation referred to in [34] she said ""[y]ou deprive me of my money and I'll cause you trouble"". She said ""I don't remember that"".

TW's re-examination

[42] In re-examination TW stated that she wrote the postcards and the letter in an effort to ""keep the peace with mum and, like, because [I] tried to let her know just where I was to make, like, say I was all right too"". She also said that she had not seen any family members prior to attending her half-sister's wedding and that at the wedding she spoke to her sisters but not the appellant.

Mr Rosser QC’s cross-examination of the complainant at the retrial


	
	The complainant confirmed that on 4 February 2013 she attended at the Bega Police Station, where she was invited by police to view three brief segments of a video taken at her sister A’s wedding in 1995. The video, which extended over some hours, was located by A after her father was convicted in the judge alone trial.
	
	
	The complainant also confirmed she was invited by police to read a letter she sent from Cairns, Queensland to the appellant addressed, “Dear Dad” and signed, “All my love”. That letter was sent in the same timeframe as letters and cards tendered in the defence case at the earlier trial and summarised by Beech-Jones J at [38]-[40].
	
	
	The three segments from the wedding video and the “Dear Dad” letter was the focus of Mr Rosser’s cross-examination. It was also central to the evidence relied upon by the appellant on the appeal as evidence so seriously undermining the complainant’s credibility that the jury ought to have had a reasonable doubt as to the appellant’s guilt. The additional feature of the evidence relied upon by the appellant’s counsel on the appeal as compounding the doubt the jury should have had was the evidence of the complainant’s mother contradicting the complainant’s evidence that she complained to her about the appellant’s sexual assault when she was aged nine (the charge on the indictment) and contradicting the complainant’s evidence that when the appellant was confronted with that allegation an argument ensued and her mother excluded him from the family home.
	


The “Dear Dad” letter


	
	In essence, the complainant gave evidence that she wrote the “Dear Dad” letter because her mother asked her to. She said that her mother made that request of her by telephone in one of the calls she made each fortnight from Queensland at her mother’s insistence so that her mother would know she was “still alive”. While she agreed that her mother did not suggest how she might express herself in the “Dear Dad” letter, or ask her to sign it “All my love”, she said that she did what her mother asked of her in the hope that it would help to reconcile what had, by that time, become a family rift because of her fractured relationship with the appellant, and that she did what her mother asked of her principally in her mother’s interests.
	
	
	It was not put to the complainant in cross-examination that the appellant responded favourably to the letter by acknowledging its receipt, or that her overtures smoothed the way for her inclusion as a family member before her sister K’s wedding. To the contrary. She gave evidence, as did her sister K, that the complainant was ostracised at her wedding in 1986.
	
	
	It was put to the complainant in cross-examination that her evidence that her mother asked her to write the letter was a lie and that the truth was that the letter was a genuine expression of her loving regard for the appellant. It was also put to her that she falsely attributed to her mother a request that she write to the appellant to cover up the fact that she had been “caught out” after the first trial. She rejected both propositions. When she was cross-examined as to why she included in the letter an express request that the appellant write to her, she explained that the tone and content of the entire letter was because her mother had asked her to “write him a nice letter” so that the appellant may allow her entry back into the family. She said that she also included in that letter a desire to “come down to say hello at Christmas” because she wanted to see her family and she knew that she would not be allowed contact with them until the appellant gave his permission.
	


Impact of the “Dear Dad” letter on the complainant’s credibility


	
	I regard the complainant’s explanations for the “Dear Dad” letter as open to the jury to be accepted as consistent with the explanations she gave under cross-examination at the earlier trial for the cards and letters she had addressed to both her mother and the appellant from Queensland, all of which was before the jury for their consideration, as was the complainant’s explanation for sending them. I respectfully disagree with Macfarlan JA at [33] and Bellew J at [125], that the complainant’s explanation for sending the postcards and letters cannot be reconciled with the warmth of her tone and the number of communications, or that it is necessarily inconsistent with her deep, but by that time unexpressed, hatred of the appellant for his abuse of her as a child. I consider that her explanation for the “Dear Dad” letter (as with her explanations for the course of correspondence of which the “Dear Dad” letter was a further example) was credible and the attack upon her credibility by reference to that material was a matter properly within the province of the jury when considering whether they were sufficiently confident of her honesty and reliability to return a guilty verdict.
	


The wedding video


	
	The most controversial of the three video segments of A’s wedding was a group portrait of the complainant’s family. The appellant and his wife were seated with the bride standing immediately behind the appellant. The complainant was standing to the bride’s right and her two other sisters (J and K) to the far left of the bride, standing behind the complainant’s mother. A still photograph of the same arrangement, either lifted from the video or taken by a photographer at the same time as the video was being shot, was tendered at the first trial. That photograph, as with the corresponding video segment, shows the complainant with her right hand extended over the appellant’s shoulder and placed on the centre of his chest. The complainant gave evidence at the first trial, which she confirmed in the retrial, that she was included in the photograph as a family member at the insistence of the photographer and directed by that person to place her hand on the appellant. She agreed that both the photograph and the video segment showed an apparently happy family, but said the reality was that she was nervous and uneasy in the appellant’s presence. She said she obliged her sister, it being her sister’s wedding day, by not resisting what the photographer asked of her.
	
	
	As the third segment of the video comprises a sequence of moving images (albeit over a period of a minute or thereabouts), it reveals more than the still photograph. The video segment shows the complainant touching the appellant, which has the appearance of being a spontaneous action as she placed her hand on the appellant’s chest. It then reveals that she moved her hand (again, seemingly spontaneously) and touched or tickled his dewlap. It was suggested to her in cross-examination that she was “playing with his chins” as a display of affection. She disagreed. She said that, in the moment, she “tried to be as nice as she could to everybody, including the appellant”. She accepted that the video gave the appearance of her touching the appellant in an affectionate and natural way, and that others viewing it may perceive it that way, but it was not a reflection of her real feelings. She also gave evidence that she had already had an argument with the appellant at her sister K’s wedding a couple of years earlier and that she “didn’t want to ruin [her] little sister’s wedding”. She said on the day of A’s wedding she was told not to cause any trouble.
	
	
	Her sister K gave evidence consistent with the complainant’s evidence in this respect. She also confirmed the complainant’s evidence that at neither her wedding nor A’s wedding was the complainant permitted to sit with the wedding party, being seated, at the appellant’s and their mother’s direction, “down the back” with people she did not know. K also confirmed that in the family photograph (and video) taken at A’s wedding, the complainant was positioned behind the appellant at the direction of the photographer, despite the complainant’s efforts to distance herself from the appellant and that it was the photographer who directed that she put her hand on the appellant’s shoulder. K gave evidence in chief as follows:
	


Q. And I take it that the photographer asked [the complainant] to put her hand on whose shoulder?

A. [The appellant’s].

Q. Did she do that?

A. Yes, reluctantly, but she did kick up a bit of a song and dance about it, like to me like she didn’t want to and in the end she just did.

Q. Just pause there, you said she did it reluctantly. Why do you say that? What did she say?

A. She just looked at me and she just went, “I don’t want to do that”, more or less, you know, just said, “I don’t want to” and yeah, in the end she just did, just ‘cause she didn’t want to cause an argument.

Q. Did you see what happened after she put her hand on the accused?

A. Well the photo was taken.

Q. See what happened then?

A. And then she sort of gave like a strangling sort of motion.

…

Q. Did she say anything at that time, when she made that gesture?

A. No, she just gave me a look.

…

Q. At the wedding, what were your observations as to the relationship between – if any – between the accused and [the complainant]?

A. Very strained.


	
	In his cross-examination of K, Mr Rosser did not suggest that the arrangement of the family members in the wedding photograph (as revealed in the moving images on the video) was other than to “balance the photograph”. He did suggest to her, however, that the complainant had quite spontaneously, voluntarily and happily displayed affection toward the appellant, by the touching of his chest and the “tickling of his chins”. K said, “I don’t see it as that, no”. Mr Rosser did not challenge K’s evidence in any other respect including, in particular, her evidence (extracted above) which is supportive of the complainant’s evidence, or her evidence that the complainant expressed nervousness in advance of attending A’s wedding given what had occurred at her own wedding some years earlier.
	


The impact of the “wedding video” on the complainant’s credibility


	
	Having given close consideration to the third segment of the wedding video and the complainant’s evidence, and her sister K’s evidence about the circumstances in which the sequence was filmed, I am not persuaded that this evidence renders the complainant’s evidence concerning the sexual assault she sustained as a child inherently incredible. I respectfully disagree with Macfarlan JA’s assessment of the complainant’s explanations for what is shown in the third segment as “varied and unconvincing”. To the contrary. I consider her explanations for her apparent but disingenuous demonstrations of affection for the appellant as open and available and, viewed in that way, not inconsistent with her evidence that she had a deep and lasting enmity for him for his sexual mistreatment of her as a child, but which she concealed for understandable reasons.
	
	
	In so far as concerns the remaining two segments of the wedding video, I do not regard them as undermining the complainant’s credibility in the way contended for by the appellant’s counsel at trial and by his counsel on the appeal. Whilst it is true that under cross-examination she initially resisted any suggestion that in the second video segment she moved toward the appellant and rubbed his back in an apparent gesture of affection and warmth, she ultimately accepted that the video showed that gesture. She explained this conduct consistently with her evidence generally, in that she was endeavouring to give the appearance of being a member of a close and integrated family to guests at the wedding for her sister’s sake, when in truth, at least from her perspective, the appellant’s mistreatment of her as a child had made her fearful of him and his determination to exclude her from the family made her wary of him.
	
	
	There was also evidence before the jury that months prior to the complainant making a formal police statement in September 2008, she had commenced a written statement detailing the past abuse and had also been undertaking counselling for some time. This was evidence the jury were entitled to take into account not only as part of the complainant’s evidence bearing upon the question whether she had been sexually assaulted as a child, but evidence they were entitled to take into account in considering whether the jury found her to be a truthful witness, upon whose evidence they could confidently rely as distinct from a witness who would or might be motivated to make false accusations for financial reasons.
	


The complainant’s motive to lie


	
	It was put to the complainant by cross-examining counsel at the earlier trial (doubtless as a result of what the appellant told police in his ERISP) that the reason she falsely accused the appellant of sexual and physical abuse was to ensure that she was not deprived of her quarter share of her grandmother's estate. It was suggested to her that it was after being advised that her mother was going to pursue her entitlement to challenge the grandmother's will that the complainant decided to “cause trouble”. One obvious difficulty with the attribution to the complainant of that as a motive for the making of false allegations against the appellant (the only motive ever suggested to her) is that the person who was seeking a share of her grandmother's estate was not the appellant but her mother. Furthermore, as the evidence before the jury made clear, it was the complainant’s mother who was the only party to the proceedings in the Supreme Court. Further, by the time the complainant first came to give evidence under oath, the dispute in relation to the grandmother's estate had been resolved by the complainant and each of her sisters entering into a deed of arrangement with their mother.
	


The complainant’s mother’s evidence


	
	As noted by Beech-Jones J at [48] in ALS v R [2013] NSWCCA 63, the Crown, by agreement with the defence, did not call the appellant’s wife at the earlier trial after adverse credit findings were made by the trial judge in the judge alone trial which preceded the appellant’s earlier trial at which he was charged, but acquitted, of sexually assaulting the complainant’s sisters K and J.
	
	
	She was called as a Crown witness at the appellant’s retrial before the jury, no doubt at the request of the defence and in discharge of the Crown’s obligation to call her as a Crown witness. However, given that when first spoken to by police in 2010 she gave an account contradicting the complainant’s evidence and supporting the appellant’s account that he had never sexually or physically assaulted the complainant, the defence could have been under no illusion that her evidence would not be embraced by the Crown.
	


The complainant’s mother’s evidence in chief


	
	The trial advocate led evidence confirming that when she commenced her relationship with the appellant, she had three young daughters and that when the appellant moved in with her he assumed the role of a step-parent. When describing the degree of discipline he exercised over the complainant in that role, she said that he would sometimes smack her and once used a belt to discipline her. The complainant’s mother volunteered that she told him that was not to happen and he did not do use a belt again.
	
	
	She also gave evidence that on Friday nights the appellant would go to the hotel and, after returning home, would behave aggressively toward her. She said:
	


Q. Did he consume a lot of alcohol on those occasions?

A. He didn’t have to consume a lot of alcohol, because he didn’t drink a lot. It didn’t take much to put him over.

Q. And when he, in your words, put him over, how did he behave towards you when he came home?

A. Sometimes he was aggressive.

Q. And when you say aggressive, what do you mean?

A. We had arguments.

Q. Did those arguments become physical at any stage?

A. Yes.

Q. And when you agree that they became physical, what would he do in relation to you?

A. He’d hit me.


	
	When pressed by the trial advocate as to what the arguments were about, she said that it would have been about the appellant’s drinking, despite suggesting in the evidence extracted above that he “didn’t drink a lot”. She said the domestic violence associated with his drinking extended over seven years and in a succession of houses they lived in during that time. Given the modest size of the houses, she agreed that the complainant would have seen the appellant assaulting her. When asked whether she was injured as a result of the assaults, she said:
	


Q. Were you ever injured as a result of the assaults by your husband?

A. No.

Q. Did you ever have any – a bruise?

A. I’ve had bruises.

Q. You don’t count that as an injury, is that what you say?

A. I bruise now.

Q. But I’m talking about that time when you were living at …, over that seven year period and the accused assaulted you by hitting you with his open hand, you had bruises, is that the case?

A. I couldn’t have had too many bruises. It wasn’t as if he bashed and bashed at me.

Q. And did he ever use a fist, a closed fist?

A. No, never. Never.

Q. What about choking you?

A. Never.

Q. Was there ever a time when you were on the floor and he was hitting you?

A. No.

Q. Did you ever have an injury above your eye?

A. Yes.

Q. And what was the nature of that injury?

A. It was here and it was caused by hitting into the corner of her car door in the night time.

Q. Well just be clear about it, do you say that the accused did something in relation to you with the car door?

A. No. No I didn’t say that. We’d been to my brother-in-law and sister-in-law’s for dinner. It was late at night. When we got out of the car, the footpath was slanted a bit so that made it that once I was out of the car I was low and I’d forgotten to get something out of the car and I’ve turned back around and the door wasn’t back far enough and it hit me just here.

Q. You understand I was asking you questions about injuries occasioned to you at the hands of the accused?

A. Yes.

Q. You say that’s the eye, the area you pointed to, just for the transcript, above your left eye in the area of your eyebrow, you say that was some sort of accident, do you?

A. Yes, it was here.

Q. Do you recall an occasion when the accused was assaulting you and [the complainant] came to your aid?

A. Never. The girls were told to stay in the bedroom out of the way.

Q. Who told the girls to stay in the bedroom out of the way?

A. I did and [the appellant] did.

Q. Was there ever an occasion where she tried to fight him and pull him off you?

A. No.

Q. Did you ever see her try to jump on his back at a time when he was being violent towards you?

A. No.

Q. Did he ever throw her across the room, when she was trying to come to your aid?

A. Never.

Q. Did you ever hit him?

A. Yes.

Q. What happened when you hit him?

A. He’d hit back.


	
	When the trial advocate asked whether there were occasions when, after coming home drunk, the appellant had occasion to get out of bed and use the toilet during the night, she said that once the appellant went to bed he usually stayed in bed and even were he to have need to use the toilet, she would know about it because she was a light sleeper. She went on to deny any possibility that the appellant could have got out of bed at any time and gone into the complainant’s room without her knowing. In essence, she said that had never happened. She said the only time he may have gone into the room was to kiss the complainant goodnight or to tell her to come out for dinner.
	
	
	Leave was applied for under s 38 of the Evidence Act (and not opposed) to cross-examine the complainant’s mother as to this aspect of her evidence in light of answers she had given to police in an interview in June 2010:
	


Q. You told us in your evidence earlier today that, I think you were asked [by police], “Did the accused go into the girls’ room” and said, “Sometimes he’d kiss them goodnight, he never went into the girls’ room drunk” is that right, do you remember that evidence this morning?

A. Yes.

Q. You told the police something different when you were interviewed by them on 17 June 2010, didn’t you?

A. I had said that he never went into their room.

Q. You were asked at 174, “Did you ever know [the appellant] to go into the girls’ room?” and you said, “No”. Remember that?

A. I remember that.

Q. And--

A. Meaning that he didn’t--

Q. Just pardon me for a moment. It was then put to you,

“Q 175. Never?

A. No.

Q 176. Not for any particular reason?

A. Not that I know of, no.

Q 177. Why is that?

A. There was no reason for him to go in there.”

Do you remember that evidence in--

A. Yes.

Q. And you’ve changed your evidence today, haven’t you?

A. I’ve said yes he had gone in perhaps to kiss them goodnight.

Q. That’s different to the evidence you--

A. But the evidence that--

Q. Just pardon me ma’am. We can’t talk over each other. You’ve changed your evidence today from the evidence you gave to the police, that’s true isn’t it?

HIS HONOUR: Well please Mr Crown I think we should be careful with what’s being put. What should be, I think, if we put what was said today and what was said previously without any adjectives.

TRIAL ADVOCATE: Thank you, your Honour.

Q. You say today that sometimes he’d kiss them goodnight, do you mean by that he went into their rooms?

A. Yes.

Q. And you say today that he never went into the girls’ room when he was drunk?

A. No he didn’t.

Q. You told the police that--

HIS HONOUR: On what day?

TRIAL ADVOCATE

Q. On 17 June 2010 that he never went into the girls’ room for any particular reason. Do you see that?

A. Yes and with the line of questioning that was going on then it was – they were trying to make out smut with him and that was why I said, “No”.


	
	In my view, from that line of questioning the jury would be entitled to draw an inference adverse to the credibility of the complainant’s mother as an impartial and unbiased witness given her implicit admission that she framed her answers to police because her husband was being accused of sexual interference with her daughters and then changed her account in evidence before the jury to be coincident with her husband’s evidence.
	
	
	The witness also denied any occasion when her daughters were left unsupervised by her in the appellant’s care, as exemplified in the following questions:
	


Q. – generally the girls were with you and that they weren’t often left with him?

A. They were never left with him there.

Q. What about at … Street?

A. No, my girls used to go shopping with me. I’m an only child and I like the company.

Q. Were there occasions where he was left with the care of the girls at … Street?

A. No.

Q. Not ever?

A. No.

Q. You say that there was no time when the accused was left with [the complainant] for example?

A. No.

Q. Never, ever?

A. No. We all used to go shopping, the girls liked going shopping.

Q. But you had, at that stage you had four girls, is that right?

A. Yes.

Q. Various ages?

A. Yeah.

Q. And you always took them shopping?

A. Always took them shopping.

Q. They were never alone with the accused?

A. No.


	
	The trial advocate followed that answer with this question, “Is that something you’ve just thought of just now?”, to which she answered, “No”.
	
	
	After denying that there was ever an occasion when the complainant might have been left at home with the appellant, the complainant’s mother gave the following evidence on the issue of complaint (it is this aspect of the trial advocate’s examination of the witness that is the subject of the second and third grounds of appeal):
	


Q. Did [the complainant] ever complain to you about something that the accused had done to her?

A. No.

Q. I’m talking about a time when she was nine and you were living at [the place where the complainant gave evidence she was sexually assaulted], did she ever complain to you about something the accused--

A. No.

Q. Did she ever tell you that he had touched her in a sexual way at … Street?

A. No.

Q. Did you ever have an argument with him about him touching [the complainant]?

A. No.

Q. Was there an occasion where you asked the accused to leave the house?

A. No.

Q. Did he ever go and live at a pub in … at some stage?

A. No.

Q. In 1974?

A. No.


	
	The complainant’s mother agreed that the complainant ran away from home when she was age 17. However, the explanation she gave for her daughter’s departure was because “she lost an apprenticeship” the appellant had secured for her. She agreed that the complainant never lived with the family again, and although she maintained contact with her daughter, there was no communication between her daughter and the appellant for many years. She attributed that to embarrassment on the complainant’s part because she had lost the apprenticeship. She also confirmed that the appellant had made it clear he “didn’t want [the complainant] near the house or in the house”, despite being aware that this was during a time when she was sending cards and letters to her mother. She denied ever asking the complainant to write to the appellant to try to mend the relationship with him, which she persistently attributed to embarrassment on the complainant’s part for having lost the apprenticeship. I note (as will be obvious when I come to summarise the appellant’s evidence) the appellant gives the same explanation for the complainant leaving home and his insistence that all contact with her be severed. In my view, the jury would be entitled to find their evidence a contrivance and their joint explanation for the complainant leaving the family home and being thereafter unwelcome in it as utterly implausible.
	
	
	The complainant’s mother also denied that there was any trouble at A’s wedding between the appellant and the complainant as to which she said, “No, why would there be?”. This evidence was not only in conflict with the complainant, but also her daughter K.
	


Cross-examination of the complainant’s mother


	
	Mr Rosser’s cross-examination was brief but on the issue of complaint it was direct and focused. I extract it in full not only for its significance as part of the evidence available to be considered by the jury but for the bearing it has to Grounds 2 and 3 on the appeal.
	


Q. Just to make it clear, we are told that there is a date that probably just before school holidays in December 1974 when you came home from shopping with K, J and A and your daughter [the complainant] told you that the accused had just that day had sexual intercourse with her?

A. No.

Q. Did that ever happen?

A. No.

Q. What would you have done if she’d told you that?

A. I’d have rang the police straight away.

Q. Was it something – is that something you’d have been prepared to overlook?

A. No.

Q. We’re also told that that day after you were – after [the complainant] told you that she was taken by the accused into her bedroom and given a flogging?

A. No.

Q. And that you kicked him out of the house for a couple of weeks?

A. No. He was never--

Q. Did that ever happen?

A. Sorry?

Q. Did that ever happen?

A. No.


	
	The trial advocate did not re-examine.
	


The impact of the evidence of the complainant’s mother


	
	On my analysis of the evidence of the complainant’s mother, the jury could have been in no doubt that the trial advocate’s questioning of her as to whether the appellant was ever alone with the children and whether he ever went into their rooms (drunk or sober), and what was led as prior inconsistent statements in her interview with police concerning the latter, was to challenge her credibility. Since much of the questioning was in the form of leading questions put as if in cross-examination (as to which no objection was taken), the jury could have been in no doubt that the trial advocate sought to discredit the complainant’s mother’s assertion that there was no occasion when the appellant was alone with the complainant (or any of her daughters), or that he ever went into their bedrooms such as might have afforded him the opportunity to commit the offence with which he was charged or perpetrate the abuse led by the Crown as relationship evidence, inclusive of her denials that her daughter made a complaint of sexual abuse.
	
	
	The jury also heard evidence that the complainant's mother had suffered years of domestic violence at the hands of the appellant without taking any steps to protect herself or prevent her young daughters from being exposed to violence. It would also have been open to the jury to consider that the complainant’s mother only revealed the fact that she was a victim of domestic violence because the appellant had revealed in his ERISP that he had beaten his wife and that their evidence on this issue deliberately understated the extent of the violence as exemplified by the evidence under questioning as to whether police attended (see the appellant’s evidence on this question at [95] below).
	
	
	That being so, in my view it also follows that it was also open to the jury to find that, on the whole of her evidence, the complainant’s mother was not a reliable witness on matters of substance, including whether the complainant had complained to her in the terms and in the circumstances the complainant deposed to in her evidence and the way the appellant treated the complainant, thereafter culminating in her being progressively ostracised from the family.
	
	
	The appellant’s evidence
	
	
	The appellant’s evidence in chief was limited to confirming the accuracy and truthfulness of his denials to police when interviewed in June 2010. The ERISP and a transcript edited to remove questions directed to the complaints of abuse by K and J was tendered in the Crown case. It was also summarised by Beech-Jones J in ALS v R [2013] NSWCCA 63, and which I gratefully adopt:
	


[43] I note five matters about the appellant's ERISP. First the appellant denied each and every allegation that he was either violent or sexually abusive towards TW.

[44] Second, while the appellant stated that he used to drink ""no more than anyone else"", he did admit to assaulting his wife in the past but said that he had not done so for forty years.

[45] Third, the appellant said that when the family lived at the houses in Adamstown Heights and Merewether he would not go into the girls' room unless he needed to get them for something. However, he said he did go into their room to kiss them goodnight on the cheek, and sometimes he would go in there after he had been to the hotel to say ""goodnight"".

[46] Fourth, in relation to the alleged offence against TW, the appellant said that only rarely would his wife leave the girls at home. He said that it was possible that he had been alone in the house with TW, but he denied any sexual misconduct or any of the events following the assault that she alleged occurred.

[47] Fifth, the appellant stated that TW's account of events was fabricated and motivated by the will dispute.


	
	Specifically, as concerns the allegation of sexual intercourse the subject of the indictment, the appellant said in his evidence, “It didn’t happen, it just didn’t happen”. He also denied the allegations of sexual misconduct led by the Crown as relationship evidence.
	


The cross-examination of the appellant


	
	Under cross-examination, the appellant confirmed that he was aged 18 when he first met the complainant’s mother at a club. She was aged 27 and not working at that time. He confirmed that he was working (in some unstated capacity) at BHP on a seven-day roster, including weekends. He said that for that reason, he did not go to the hotel very much during the week to drink with “the boys”, but did drink with them after football. He agreed that when he arrived home drunk, there were often arguments. After some pressing by the trial advocate, he agreed that the arguments were about his drinking and that those arguments erupted into violence, however he denied that he ever punched his wife with a fist. He said he only ever hit her with an open hand. This was available to be considered by the jury as either an honest account of the domestic violence inflicted by the appellant and suffered by the complainant’s mother in the family home at the time when the complainant says she was assaulted both physically and sexually, or a contrived account in an attempt to minimise the extent of his assaultive behaviour generally and his sexual assault of the complainant in particular.
	
	
	When asked whether, after hitting his wife with an open hand, the appellant hit her more than once, he said:
	


A. I don’t know. I can’t say I hit her more than once. Look, it’s hard to explain it. If I hit [my wife], [my wife] would hit me back. She wouldn’t just stand there and be passive. It wasn’t like I went home and dragged her out and did that. It wasn’t like that assaulting. Just the argument would happen. If I hit her, she’d try to defend herself. I regret that.

Q. Didn’t you try and choke her?

A. Never.

Q. Didn’t you have her on the--

A. Never.

Q. –floor and try to choke her?

A. Never ever, ever.

Q. And you didn’t hit her and cause her – did you cause an injury to her face?

A. I could have, a bruise or whatever, because it was an open hand.

Q. You said in the interview that you’d have to ask [your wife] and she agreed that she had bruises?

A. Well, it’s not like I know that she had bruises but I don’t--

Q. You hit her. You knew--

A. I don’t deny--

Q. You saw the bruise, didn’t you?

A. –that she would have some.


	
	The appellant agreed in cross-examination that he was physically stronger than both his wife and his children, and that his physical presence was such that he was able to intimidate his wife. In answer to a question asked by the trial judge, the appellant gave the following evidence which, in my view, the jury would be entitled to take into account adverse to him when assessing his credibility:
	


Q. I think the question that’s being put to you is that by your physical presence you were able to intimidate your wife, I think that’s what’s being put?

A. Well I probably could if I was aggressive your Honour, you know, I mean I think anybody could to most wives.


	
	He also gave evidence, consistently with his wife’s evidence, that there was no occasion, even after he had assaulted her on arriving home from the hotel, when he did not sleep in the marital bed. Although he agreed that the arguments consisted of loud yelling, he denied that there was ever an occasion when the complainant came out of her room to protect her mother.
	
	
	He claimed no recollection (as did his wife) of the argument detailed by the complainant in her evidence which resulted in the attendance of police, as to which he gave the following evidence:
	


Q. When you say the arguments got loud, I think you agreed with that, was there an occasion when an argument between you and your wife saw the police come to the door?

A. I can’t recall that. I heard you say it before but I can’t recall that. It could have happened. I don’t know.

Q. And is it the case that when the – well, do you agree that it could have happened, you just can’t remember? Is that right?

A. I don’t know. I know the police came on time for a – when I went for my bus licence but I can’t recall the other time.

Q. The police came to your house in relation to a bus licence?

A. Because I went for a bus licence. I had my semi licence and I went to get a bus licence. You have to – the police come to your door and interview you.

Q. You lived next door at … to Mrs Robinson, is that right?

A. That’s correct.

Q. And you don’t remember the police coming to your house at … Street?

A. No, I don’t.

Q. You don’t remember speaking to the police at the front door?

A. I don’t. I could’ve. I don’t recall that though.

Q. It’d be a fairly significant event though, isn’t it, if a police officer comes to your front door about a disturbance?

A. It is, yes.

Q. But you say you can’t remember?

A. I can’t remember that. They could’ve come. I’m not saying they didn’t.

Q. Did you tell – do you remember speaking to the police if they could’ve come? Do you remember – you would’ve spoken to the police?

A. I can’t tell you I spoke to the police when I can’t even remember whether they come to my house.


	
	Again, on this evidence it would have been open to the jury to reject the appellant’s claim to having no memory of police attending in response to a complaint of domestic violence as untrue, and to treat the evidence of his wife to similar effect as adverse to her credibility on the question whether the complainant told her of the sexual assault.
	
	
	The appellant was also asked whether there were occasions when he came home from the pub when he had to discipline the children. He said he never went near the children, having had no need to discipline them, but he may have gone into their rooms to say “goodnight”.
	
	
	Again consistently with the complainant’s mother’s evidence, he said that there were no occasions when he was left alone with the children and that his wife “used to take the children everywhere with her”.
	
	
	The appellant also gave evidence, consistently with the evidence of his wife, that his relationship with the complainant was a good relationship until she discontinued her apprenticeship and left home at age 17. He said, “I never had that much contact after that”. The trial advocate suggested to him that the relationship with the complainant changed many years before that in the context of his drinking and the violence he inflicted on her mother, as to which he gave the following evidence:
	


Q. I suggest to you that the relationship changed with [the complainant] many years before that in that changed because of your drinking and you violence towards her mother. What do you say about that?

A. I say that’s wrong.

Q. That she saw you being violent with her mother and she heard you being violent towards her mother?

A. Well why didn’t the other ones, there’s three other daughters. Why hasn’t it affected them?

Q. She saw marks on her mother caused by you when you hit her?

A. I can’t say what she saw.

Q. She also was struck by you and she had welts on her bottom because of you?

A. Never. Never, ever, ever did they ever get hit. When I had an argument with K they were sent to their room and they never, ever were touched. The only time they ever got a smack was when they were naughty or they’d get sent in the corner.


	
	In my view, the jury would be entitled to see the last answer, in the almost identical terms with which the complainant’s mother dealt with the question of the appellant disciplining the children, as another deliberate contrivance on their part to give false evidence and, viewed in that way, as the appellant deliberately underplaying his violent disposition generally and the opportunity he had to assault the complainant in the ways she detailed in her evidence, including the sexual assault charged on the indictment.
	
	
	The trial advocate put a detailed series of propositions to the appellant consistently with his obligations under the rule in Browne v Dunn, directing the appellant to each of the allegations detailed by the complainant in her evidence. To each of those propositions the appellant denied in increasingly emphatic terms that he had at any time mistreated any of his daughters and, in particular, the complainant.
	
	
	The appellant’s denials under oath, as with his denials when first confronted by the complainant in the recorded conversation under warrant and his denials to police when interviewed, were all equally emphatic. After giving consideration to that fact in the context of his evidence generally, I do not regard his denials to be of such overwhelming weight that I am left with a reasonable doubt as to his guilt. As I have also sought to emphasise in the context of my review of the complainant’s evidence, it is essential when exercising the jurisdiction under s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act to give full regard to the primacy of the jury as the fact-finding tribunal and the opportunity they had to consider the way in which a witness gives their evidence.
	
	
	By their verdict in this case, the jury must have rejected the appellant’s denials under oath as unconvincing, as do I.
	


GROUND 2: The trial miscarried by reason of the conduct of the presentation of the case by the Crown Prosecutor.

GROUND 3: The trial miscarried in that his Honour failed to direct the jury that, because the Crown Prosecutor failed to challenge the complainant's mother's evidence that the complainant did not make an immediate complaint to her about the alleged offence, the jury should take that failure into account in assessing the complainant's evidence.


	
	The appellant’s senior counsel accepted that leave was required under Rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules (NSW) to argue both grounds of appeal. He submitted that leave should be granted as the decision by trial counsel not to complain about the trial advocate’s closing address (in the very limited respect complained of) and to seek directions from the trial judge to address the unfairness to which that submission was said to give rise, could not reasonably be said to have been the result of any forensic decision by trial counsel. It was further submitted that leave should be granted as the rule of unfairness which underpins the principal in Browne and Dunn has been so egregiously breached in this trial that the trial has miscarried.
	
	
	I would refuse leave under Rule 4 and dismiss both grounds of appeal.
	
	
	The appellant submitted that in his closing address to the jury the trial advocate breached the rule in Browne v Dunn by submitting that there was evidence of immediate complaint when the complainant’s mother had not given that evidence and where he had made no application under s 38 of the Evidence Act to cross-examine her on the issue so as to afford her the opportunity of answering the suggestion in his closing address that she should not be believed.
	
	
	The passage in the closing address to which exception was taken on the appeal arose in the way following context: After reminding the jury of the complainant’s evidence, including what the trial advocate submitted was her courage in standing up to the appellant when he was drunk and abusive, and her fears when she watched her mother and sisters walk away from the home leaving her alone with him on the day he had sexual intercourse with her, and after he summarised her evidence of the assault and how she felt, the trial advocate said:
	


What she is telling you is, in the Crown's submission, the real circumstances of what happened. It's not made up, in the Crown's submission to you.

After she says she tells her mother that he ""stuck his thing in me and said he was going to split me in two."" What that amounts to, in the Crown's submission to you, is that she made immediate complaint to her mother.


	
	The appellant submitted that what his counsel characterised as the breach of the rule in Browne v Dunn by the trial advocate’s assertion that “she made immediate complaint” was productive of two consequences. First, he ought not to have addressed the jury that an “immediate complaint” was made. This was said to be the substance of Ground 2 of the amended grounds of appeal. R v Kennedy [2000] NSWCCA 487; 118 A Crim R 34 at [35]-[37] was cited as authority for that proposition.
	
	
	As Latham J observed in Soames v R [2012] NSWCCA 188 at [104]-[106], the authorities (of which Kennedy is one) which deal with the conduct of a prosecutor where an attack is made on the credibility of a witness called in the Crown case in breach of the rule in Browne v Dunn, emphasise that the unfairness which is said to result from that conduct is because the witness has not had the opportunity to answer an allegation of bias or dishonesty.
	
	
	In this case, after some trenchant questioning of the complainant’s mother about the extent of violence in the household, the trial advocate raised the issue of complaint with the complainant’s mother in a non-leading way. At [84] I set out the questions the trial advocate asked the complainant’s mother as to whether the complainant ever complained to her about the appellant’s sexual mistreatment of her, as to which (after interrupting the trial advocate as he framed the question) she gave an emphatic denial. This was consistent with her evidence that the appellant had never inflicted physical violence of any kind on her children and only minor injuries, if any, on her; a position from which she did not resile. The submission advanced on the appeal seems to be that the trial advocate was obliged at that time, in order to comply with the rule in Browne v Dunn, to make an application under s 38 of the Evidence Act in order to cross-examine the witness by a series of leading questions (I assume in the form of positive propositions to the effect that her daughter did complain), and that when he was met again with her anticipated denial, to then accuse her of lying to support her husband in order to make clear that the Crown was challenging her credibility and to permit her to defend herself against that accusation.
	
	
	In the circumstances of this case I do not regard adherence to the principle of unfairness that underpins the rule of the rule in Browne v Dunn to have required the trial advocate to have made that application. As I have already observed in my assessment of the evidence in considering Ground 1 of the appeal, the jury would have been in no doubt that the trial advocate did not regard the complainant’s mother as a witness of truth given his questioning of her generally. Although the Court was not referred to it, in his closing address the trial advocate did not go the distance of accusing the complainant’s mother of lying. His treatment of her evidence and her lack of credibility was more subtle. When dealing further with the complainant’s credibility later in his address (the mainstay of his submission that the jury would be left in no doubt as to the appellant’s guilt), he said:
	


The Crown says to you that she was a compelling witness. She told you in that extraordinary detail the events subject to the charge. And she did it in a way the Crown says to you was convincing because of its warts and all detail. Her evidence in the Crown’s - and you might think – of an unspeakable act, she described in detail and that evidence was of such a quality that you would be convinced of its veracity.

Now, in the Crown’s submission to you she was honest and that she was accurate in the circumstances of a person relating what a nine year old had experienced; that that [sic] amalgam of honesty and accuracy is something on which you can rely in this court. She was an extremely forthright witness.

Now, some of her evidence did not reflect well upon her, you might think. She talked about having a breakdown later in life, she talked about her depression, she talked about her associates, a bad man she might have associated with. She blamed herself for not being able to protect her mother.

Now, thank goodness we live in more enlightened times. We see that as naïve. We understand why a child may not tell somebody outside the family. But she did tell her mother. Now, you might think – it’s a matter for you whether that trust was correctly placed. It’s a matter for you. But she still said to you, quite plainly, she still loved her mother, a bond you might think is not easily broken.

[Emphasis added.]


	
	In leaving the issue of complaint as he did in evidence in chief, the trial advocate afforded Mr Rosser the forensic opportunity to cross-examine the complainant’s mother which he did, potentially, to very considerable effect. This in turn laid the ground work for a submission he advanced, also with considerable force, in his closing address on the appellant’s behalf, as the following extract makes clear:
	


But let’s look, shall we, at the evidence of the complainant. Does the evidence fit with other evidence? I’ve already referred to the fact of the very big conflict between what she says and what her mother says. “I told mum that day.” Her mum says that’s just not so. “I was never told anything like that.” The accused was kicked out of the house for two weeks. Her mother says – well, the accused says it’s not true but the mother says it’s not true.

Look, members of the jury, this is a mother we’re talking about and effectively what you are asked to believe is that that woman you saw you’re asked to believe that that woman is such an unnatural mother, is so callous and unfeeling that when she’s told by her daughter “your husband has had sexual intercourse with me this morning” within two weeks she’s got him back in the house living with her. This is her mother. Members of the jury, if nothing else, that’s got to give you the greatest pause in accepting what the complainant says to you. You really can’t divorce her allegations from the fact that she says, “I told mum that day”, and how could you be satisfied that she told mum that day?

There’s something else perhaps a bit revealing about whether she told her mother. Remember the calls [referring to the calls recorded under warrant]? Mum is on the phone a couple of times in those calls. In the first one, “Let me talk to [the appellant]”, and I’m paraphrasing. “What do you want to talk to him about?” This woman [the complainant] says, “I told my mother about this”. Wouldn’t you have thought that what you’d have heard from her then was, “You know what I want to talk about. I told you what he did to me when I was a child”? You didn’t hear that. “I want to talk to him about my childhood”, she says.

Remember if the complainant is telling you the truth … her mum knows. She told her mum the day it happened when she was nine years old that the accused had had sexual intercourse with her. Wouldn’t you have thought what she’d have said to mum, “You know what I want to talk to him about. It’s what I told you about all those years ago”. And in the second of those calls she actually tells her mother, “You have no idea”. “You have no idea”, she says to her mother. They’re her words. She says that to a woman whom she supposedly told about this.

Try to fit that together. It’s unlikely enough, we would suggest, that she told her mother about it and her mother saw fit just to ignore it and forgive him and overlook it. That’s difficult enough to swallow. But then when she speaks to her mother she doesn’t make reference to the fact “you know about it”. In fact she says the opposite. “You know nothing about it.” It is overwhelmingly likely, not, let me emphasise, not that the defence has to prove a thing to you, but it is overwhelmingly likely that her mother is telling you nothing but the simple truth. There was never any complaint like that. “There was never anything said to me like that.” You would have to find this to be a very unusual mother indeed just to let this go by the board, kick him out for two weeks and take him back. You just won’t accept that.

And what does that say to you? There is a bit of evidence that the mother – what does the Crown say to you about it? Not a word. There’s not very much to be said about it, is there? This is her own mother and you’re asked to accept what you can’t accept. That’s a very big obstacle, you accepting [the complainant].


	
	It was also submitted in support of Ground 3 that the trial judge should have directed the jury in such a way as to redress what was said to be the unfairness to the appellant by the trial advocate’s failure to comply with Browne v Dunn by giving the jury the following directions:
	



	
	The Crown did not challenge the complaint evidence from the complainant’s mother;
	
	
	That failure caused an unfairness to the appellant - in particular, the jury did not have a proper opportunity of assessing her credibility; and
	
	
	The jury should take that failure into account in assessing the weight of the complainant's evidence and the weight of the Crown's submission regarding the complaint evidence   .
	



	
	The Crown submitted, and I accept, that there was no unfairness to the appellant in the approach adopted by the trial advocate in the evidence led from the complainant’s mother or the way in which he dealt with her evidence on the question of complaint in his closing address and, accordingly, no warrant for the directions appellate counsel submitted should have been given. In particular, the Crown submitted there was a challenge to her evidence by the questions asked in chief, as is aptly demonstrated both by the questions the trial advocate did ask, and, given the way in which Mr Rosser cross-examined the complainant’s mother and then dealt with her evidence in his closing address, there was no unfairness of the kind complained of. The Crown submitted that, in this case, the jury had every opportunity to assess the credibility of the complainant’s mother by the way in which she was both examined and cross-examined. I accept that submission.
	
	
	In respect of all witnesses (including the complainant's mother), the jury were directed in conventional terms that it was for them to assess the evidence and to determine whether it was both truthful and reliable, by considering not only what the witness has had to say, but the manner in which the witness gave their evidence and the general impression which the witness made when giving their evidence. The jury could have been left in no doubt that the evidence of the complainant, on the one hand, and her mother, on the other, on the issue of complaint was diametrically opposed. The jury could also have been in no doubt, given the tenor and the style of the trial advocate’s questioning of the complainant’s mother, that he was inviting the jury to treat her evidence, at the very least, as unreliable and not to reject the complainant’s evidence as untruthful because of it.
	
	
	The order I would propose is that the appeal against conviction should be dismissed.
	
	
	BELLEW J: I have had the advantage of reading, in draft, the judgments of Macfarlan JA and Fullerton J.
	
	
	I agree, for the reasons that his Honour has expressed, with the orders that Macfarlan JA proposes. I wish only to add the following brief observations.
	
	
	In reaching the view that the appeal should be allowed, I agree with Macfarlan JA that no single factor is determinative. However, in the circumstances of the present case, particular significance attaches to three aspects of the evidence.
	
	
	Firstly, the complainant’s evidence was entirely uncorroborated. In matters of this nature that might not be regarded as unusual in one sense. What is significant in the present case is that, accepting the complainant’s account of the offending, her two sisters were in a position to corroborate at least some aspects of her evidence. No such corroboration was forthcoming from either of them. As Macfarlan JA has pointed out, the fact that there may be reasons which explain that circumstance does not operate to fill what is an evidentiary void.
	
	
	Secondly, the multiplicity of communications, in one of which extended the complainant invited the appellant to join her on a holiday, are fundamentally at odds with the complainant’s asserted feelings of animosity towards the appellant.
	
	
	Thirdly, what is depicted in the film taken at the wedding reception of the complainant’s sister is inconsistent with the complainant’s evidence. I accept that the wedding reception obviously extended over some hours and that the film tendered in evidence was a short “snapshot” of the entire event. The essence of the Crown’s submission was that what can be seen in such a snapshot should not be regarded as being generally representative of the complainant’s attitude towards the appellant at that time.
	
	
	In other circumstances, the Crown’s submission may have been deserving of greater weight. However, the film demonstrated clear and unequivocal expressions of affection on the part of the complainant towards the appellant. Even when full weight is given to the short duration of the film, what was depicted is fundamentally inconsistent with the complainant’s evidence.
	
	
	Having regard to the combination of matters to which Macfarlan JA has referred, I am driven to the conclusion that the appeal should be allowed.

		21 April 2015",2015-04-20 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2703568,R v Pratten (No 14) [2015] NSWSC 457,"JUDGMENT


	
	HIS HONOUR: The Court is required to deal with an application for a temporary stay of a pending criminal trial in relation to Mr Pratten, the accused in the trial and the applicant on the motion (hereinafter, “the applicant/accused”). Mr Pratten is the subject of seven charges of dishonestly obtaining a financial advantage by deception, contrary to s 134.2 of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth) (the Code). Each charge relates to a different financial year between 30 June 2003 and 30 June 2009 and relates to knowingly understating income derived in the relevant financial year.
	
	
	The applicant/accused was originally arrested on 22 September 2010 and on 21 November 2011 the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions (CDPP) sought restraining orders pursuant to s 17 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (Cth). Those orders were granted.
	
	
	The applicant/accused was tried before a jury; the trial commencing 19 March 2012, and concluding on 13 June 2012, with guilty verdicts in relation to each charge. In addition to the length of the trial, there were a significant number of accounting records and other documents tendered during the course of the trial and it is fair to describe the trial, and the nature of the Crown case, as complex.
	
	
	Apparently, the first trial was initially funded by the applicant/accused and, after a short period of time, was the subject of a grant of Legal Aid. It is said that the sentence proceedings were conducted on behalf of the applicant/accused on a pro bono basis, although, it seems, that the fees for the day of sentence were funded by another grant of Legal Aid.
	
	
	The applicant/accused lodged an appeal against conviction and sentence. A cross-appeal was filed by the CDPP against sentence. The Court of Criminal Appeal heard the appeal, the application for leave to appeal and associated matters over three days in June 2014 and upheld the appeal against conviction on 1 July 2014. The appeal was also funded by the Legal Aid Commission.
	
	
	Having succeeded on the conviction appeal, in the manner determined, the applicant/accused faces another trial, which is scheduled to commence on 18 May 2015, with an estimate of six weeks.
	
	
	The applicant/accused applies for the trial (and proceedings) to “be stayed pending the provision of funding for its preparation and running”. In the alternative to the primary orders sought, the applicant/accused seeks to have the commencement date of 18 May 2015 vacated.
	
	
	The applicant/accused was represented throughout the first trial, as well as during substantial proceedings, being a collateral civil attack on the institution of the prosecution by attacking the conduct of the CDPP, the Australian Federal Police, the Australian Taxation Office and/or officers thereof in relation to the investigation and was also represented for the prosecution of the appeal.
	
	
	The applicant/accused, as stated, was represented by two senior counsel and junior counsel (instructed by solicitors) during the appeal. One of the bases upon which the appeal was prosecuted was that the verdict was unreasonable, as a consequence of which all of the evidence in the first trial was required to be read by the legal representatives and was the subject of full and thorough submissions to the Court of Criminal Appeal.
	


Evidence on the Motion


	
	The essential basis upon which the applicant/accused relies for the success of the motion is the principle embodied in the comments of the High Court inDietrich v The Queen [1992] HCA 57; (1992) 177 CLR 292, namely, that for the trial of the seven charges, that is the second trial, to proceed “without representation” would not be a “fair trial” and the matter should not proceed until representation has been provided. In essence, the applicant/accused submits that he is constructively, or as a matter of practical effect, without representation, because of the manner in which Legal Aid has been provided or qualified.
	
	
	The applicant/accused relies upon two affidavits of Justeen Kim Dormer, one sworn 30 March 2015 and the other sworn 1 April 2015. The applicant/accused also relies upon an affidavit of Vivian Evans sworn 2 April 2015.
	
	
	In response, the CDPP relies upon an affidavit of Katrina Curry sworn 1 April 2015. There was no cross-examination of any witness and the factual dispute is within short compass.
	
	
	At his first trial, the applicant/accused was represented by Mr Paul Hardin of Hardin Law. On 11 February 2015, Paul Hardin advised, in writing, that he (and I infer his firm) was “no longer willing to act” in any of Mr Pratten’s matters and informed Mr Pratten that he had orally informed the Legal Aid Commission of that circumstance and was shortly to confirm it by email.
	
	
	The email correspondence referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph was the culmination of correspondence between the applicant/accused and the solicitors then acting for him. As a consequence of the foregoing, the litigation history of this matter involves one firm of solicitors acting for the applicant/accused in his first trial, in the collateral attack on the investigation and prosecution decisions, in the appeal against conviction and sentence and, necessarily, in the cross-appeal. Different counsel acted at different times. It is necessary to particularise some prior history.
	
	
	On 18 December 2014, the solicitors acting for the applicant/accused in this matter (hereinafter, “the current solicitors”) wrote to the Legal Aid Commission informing them that Mr Pratten had instructed them “that the relationship between [the applicant/accused] and [his previous solicitors] has broken down and that he would like to engage [the current solicitors]…”. The correspondence requested transfer of the Legal Aid grant from the previous solicitors to the current solicitors, notwithstanding the fact that the current solicitors were not on the Legal Aid Panel for Serious Crime.
	
	
	It is unnecessary to set out the full extent of the correspondence.
	
	
	Nevertheless, from the time of the correspondence of 18 December 2014, there was clearly a breakdown between the applicant/accused and his previous solicitors, at least from the perspective of the applicant/accused.
	
	
	On 19 December 2014, the applicant/accused wrote to the Legal Aid Commission confirming that he had not sacked his previous solicitors. This was in response to correspondence, some of which has already been mentioned.
	
	
	As earlier stated, on 11 February 2015, the previous solicitors wrote to the applicant/accused advising that they were no longer willing to act “under any circumstances in any of your matters”.
	
	
	A request was then made by the applicant/accused to transfer the grant of Legal Aid to the current solicitors.
	
	
	The ensuing correspondence between the current solicitors and the Legal Aid Commission dealt with the amount of the grant and the basis upon which funds would be allowed and the work for which it is was allowed. It also included correspondence as to rates.
	
	
	Much correspondence has occurred, as earlier stated, in relation to the time that has been allowed for preparation and the rates that have been set and whether or not the current solicitors could be the subject of a grant of Legal Aid in a serious and complex criminal proceeding.
	
	
	The material before the Court, on which there is little controversy, suggests that the criminal prosecution involves commercial complexities; the brief of evidence consists of approximately 20,000 pages; there are nearly 10,000 pages of statements and exhibits; evidence in the first trial was taken over forty days of evidence; there are approximately 2,000 pages of trial transcripts; while no witnesses were called by the defence in the first trial, there are potentially 6 or more witnesses who might be called in the defence case in the forthcoming trial; and the current estimate for the re-trial is thirty days. However, the Crown has (to its credit) proposed to adduce the evidence in a more confined manner in the re-trial, details of which are being awaited.
	
	
	The Legal Aid grant, as it currently stands, provides (to whomever it may be transferred) ten days of preparation for a solicitor at prescribed Legal Aid rates; fifteen days’ preparation for junior counsel at differently prescribed Legal Aid rates; ten days’ preparation for senior counsel at a third level of prescribed Legal Aid rates; and thirty days of hearing for senior counsel, junior counsel and a solicitor appearing at the trial.
	
	
	It is said, on behalf of the applicant/accused that the amount of time for preparation (if the current solicitors were preparing it) is between 368 and 510 hours.
	


Principles and Consideration


	
	There is no issue between the parties as to the principles to be applied in determining an application for a stay based upon the Dietrich principles. It is the effect of those principles that is in issue. Nevertheless, in order to arrive at the appropriate result, it is necessary to explain the principles. Given the absence of controversy as to those principles, the explanation will be brief.
	
	
	There is no right for an accused person to be provided with counsel or solicitor at public expense. Nevertheless, where an accused is charged with a serious criminal offence, the courts have traditionally required representation of the accused as an essential element to the provision of a fair trial: seeDietrich at 298.
	
	
	Where an accused, in the above situation, is unrepresented and the court considers that, as a consequence, an essential aspect of a fair trial is missing, the court may (and probably will) stay or adjourn a trial until arrangements are made for counsel to appear. This usually involves public expense: seeDietrich at 298. The basis for that principle derives from the fundamental principles associated with natural justice or procedural fairness. Every party, particularly a party facing a serious criminal charge, is entitled to an adequate opportunity to prepare and to present the desired case (and answer the charge as preferred).
	
	
	There are significant advantages to an accused to be represented by counsel and those advantages, as the High Court has adumbrated, are more obvious today than they have been in the past. However, as the number of appeals to the Court of Criminal Appeal discloses, those appeals being based, inter alia, on incompetence of legal representation leading to manifest injustice, there are different levels of expertise and specialisation amongst the legal profession.
	
	
	No doubt, this latter element is one of the factors that has led the Legal Aid Commission to establish panels of persons whom they consider to be competent to deal with different kinds of matters, and relevantly, a Serious Crime Panel. The restriction by the Legal Aid Commission on a grant of Legal Aid to persons who are on that panel (assuming the panel has been derived with sufficient choice for the accused or potential accused and on a bona fide basis, neither of which is impugned in these proceedings) cannot be the subject of complaint. Such a qualification on the grant of Legal Aid is not inconsistent with the principles established by the High Court in Dietrich. Indeed, it may be a necessary concomitant of the requirement that representation be competent.
	
	
	I am satisfied that, given the effect of the confiscation orders made by this Court on the assets of the applicant/accused, he does not currently have available to him sufficient resources to secure legal representation in the absence of a grant of Legal Aid. Further, I am satisfied that, as is all but conceded by the Legal Aid Commission in its requirement for an allocation from the Serious Crime Panel and its allowance for senior counsel in preparation and hearing, the matter is sufficiently serious to warrant the application of the Dietrich principles.
	
	
	In other words, it would be essential to a fair trial of the applicant/accused that he be represented during the trial. As a consequence of the foregoing, in the absence of Legal Aid and representation, the applicant/accused will not be able to obtain a fair trial from his own resources.
	
	
	I accept the submission that if the Legal Aid being offered is so inadequate or subject to such restrictive terms that adequate legal representation could not be procured on the basis offered, then the accused should be taken to be a person who, for any constructive purpose, is unrepresented: see R v Souter(1997) 93 A Crim R 400 at 402-404.
	
	
	It is no answer to the application of the principles in Dietrich that some practitioners may be available to conduct the case out of a sense of duty or basis other than the normal and usual fee and the appropriate level of preparation for proceedings. It is not for the applicant on a motion such as this to trawl though all of the legal practitioners in New South Wales to see if one can act. However, that is not the issue in this motion.
	
	
	The expert evidence before the Court suggests that, if taken afresh, a brief to represent the accused at his retrial could not be adequately prepared in the time made available by the grant of Legal Aid. It is misleading to refer to it as ten days’ preparation. It is ten days’ preparation for a solicitor and further days, as set out earlier, for junior and senior counsel. Nor is it inconsistent with Dietrich that the Legal Aid Commission insists that where two counsel are warranted each is counsel and that the solicitor is performing different work. It is not the role of the Court to arbitrate the fees set by the Legal Aid Commission or the respective roles it suggests or demands of the different branches of the legal profession.
	
	
	The difficulty with the proposition that ten days’ preparation is insufficient is, in some senses, manifest. The application is made by counsel, who is not briefed at the hearing, instructed by a solicitor, who is not the subject of a grant of Legal Aid. The Legal Aid Commission has asked the applicant/accused to select a solicitor from its panel to whom it can grant the Legal Aid.
	
	
	Ms Evans, called as an expert witness on behalf of the applicant/accused, specified the general practice in relation to the acceptance of a Legal Aid brief. She is a solicitor on the panel. Her evidence is that the Legal Aid Commission does not generally inform her of the extent of the documents disclosed in a matter and she accepts a brief on a Legal Aid basis without the knowledge of the extent of the preparation required or the extent of the brief. Once the brief is accepted, she then negotiates the terms of the grant with the Legal Aid Commission: Affidavit of Vivian Evans, 2 April 2015, at [10].
	
	
	I have no evidence or material to suggest that the foregoing general practice would not apply in this matter.
	
	
	Further, once the applicant/accused selects a solicitor to whom the grant of Legal Aid will be transferred (either a solicitor on the requisite panel or a solicitor that can establish exceptional circumstances required for a brief outside the panel) and that solicitor briefs counsel, the Court will be in the position, described separately by Gaudron J and by Toohey J in Dietrich, to ascertain whether the Court should intervene to ameliorate a risk that the trial will be unfair.
	
	
	For all the Court now knows, one or more of the counsel and solicitors that have been briefed in the various proceedings, each of which has been fully prepared, in this sorry tale of litigation, will accept the brief in these proceedings and will not require the kind of hours of preparation to which the current solicitors attest.
	
	
	The Court will not be in a position to ascertain that issue until a solicitor has been engaged and counsel instructed.
	
	
	The fundamental principle that a party is entitled to an adequate opportunity to prepare and to present (or, in criminal proceedings, to answer) the case necessarily is qualified by the proposition that the opportunity, once given, is a matter for the party. The Court cannot ensure that such an opportunity is used to the best advantage: Sullivan v Department of Transport (1978) 20 ALR 323 at 343, per Deane J.
	
	
	Thus far, the applicant/accused’s case has been prepared at least twice. There is no suggestion of incompetence of any previous legal representation. As far as the Court is aware, the previous solicitors no longer act as a result of action that has no relationship with the reasonableness and adequacy of the work they performed.
	
	
	It cannot be part of the principles applicable under Dietrich that an accused may dismiss solicitors and counsel and then claim an inadequate opportunity to prepare afresh a case that has already been prepared. Unfairness that may be caused by that course is an unfairness wholly in the hands of the accused.
	
	
	I am not suggesting that the foregoing statement is applicable to this applicant/accused, but there is nothing before the Court to suggest to the contrary. Nor, might I add, will there be anything or could there be anything until such time as solicitors and counsel who will be acting at the time of the re-trial have been engaged.
	
	
	For the foregoing reasons, I adjourned the motion to a time and date that would allow the solicitors and counsel to be engaged and the Court to be aware of the real needs of the applicant/accused.

		29 April 2016",2015-04-22 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2703570,White v Sparks [2015] NSWDC 53,"Judgment


	
	The plaintiff commenced these proceedings for defamation by statement of claim filed on 9 October 2014. The sole defendant is a journalist employed by Channel Seven’s Today Tonight programme.
	
	
	There are substantial failures to comply with r 14.30 Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW) (“UCPR”) in the statement of claim. The dates and circumstances of each of the matters complained of are not identified with clarity; the texts of the matters complained of have not been attached to the statement of claim, no imputations are pleaded, and the number of publications sued upon and the period over which they were published are difficult to estimate. Doing the best I can, these publications appear to fall into four categories:
	



	
	Between May and June 2010, the defendant contacted four persons employed by the plaintiff at the time in her dental registry for the purpose of interviews.
	
	
	On 10 May and 15 June 2010, Channel Seven’s Today Tonight television show allegations that the plaintiff was “a fraud” and “making millions of dollars of false/fraudulent claims into the Medicare and other health care systems” (statement of claim, paragraph 3). The defendant participated in that programme in some capacity.
	
	
	These broadcasts were available on YouTube until the end of August 2010, on Media Monitors until September 2010 and additionally sent in a web link emailed to the Australian Dental Association branches in September 2010 (although by whom is unclear).
	
	
	There was a further broadcast on Tuesday 8 October 2013 which, according to the statement of claim, was made after the plaintiff commenced defamation proceedings in this court against two of her former employees for their statements to Ms Sparks, and Ms Sparks and a camera crew attended outside the District Court. Those broadcasts remained on the YouTube site and Today Tonight website until January 2014.
	



	
	There do not appear to have been any fresh publications since Tuesday 8 October 2013. Thus the only publication within the limitation period as at the time when the statement of claim was formally filed would be the YouTube publication in (d) above.
	
	
	As the above chronology makes clear, these are not the first defamation proceedings commenced in relation to these matters. The plaintiff also commenced proceedings on 11 June 2013 (proceedings 2013/177859) against two of her former employees. According to JusticeLink, the first return date for the plaintiff’s proceedings against her former employees was 12 July 2013. According to the statement of claim filed in these proceedings, Ms Stark, “attacked” the plaintiff in front of the District Court when she attended the court’s Defamation List on an unspecified date in September 2013, and it was in these circumstances that the broadcast of Tuesday 8 October 2013, one of the publications the subject of these proceedings, came to be broadcast. Those proceedings were apparently dismissed by a judge conducting the defamation list, on the application of the defendants, on the basis that the plaintiff subsequently failed to prosecute them (no judgment is available).
	
	
	The circumstances in which the 8 October 2013 claim was filed out of time and the proceedings became stale are unfortunate. The plaintiff commenced these proceedings by sending copies of the statement of claim to the court for filing under cover of a letter dated 2 October 2014. The court did not attend to filing this document until 9 October 2014, one day after the limitation period for the 8 October 2013 publication had expired. However, that was not the only problem with the filing of this pleading. Regrettably, due to an oversight by the District Court Registry, the statements of claim were not returned to the plaintiff so that she could effect service, nor was the plaintiff notified of the first return date of 7 November 2014.
	
	
	On 7 November 2014, these proceedings were listed, as a first return date, before McLoughlin SC DCJ. There was no appearance for the plaintiff and his Honour made the following orders:
	


“Stood over to the Defamation List 28th November 2014

Request the Registrar write to the Plaintiff advising that if there is no appearance on the next occasion the matter may be Struck-out”


	
	Prior to the defamation list callover on 28 November 2014, I read the documents in the file, found the sealed copies had never been returned to the plaintiff for service and realised she had not been notified of the return date. The plaintiff’s request for help with the filing of the claim was set out in the statement of claim at paragraphs 9 and 15. This included a recital of the plaintiff being involved in a fatal car accident in the course of which she suffered serious injuries. She also explained her problems in her letter of 2 October 2014 as follows:
	


“I am the plaintiff for this court case matter and due to my financial hardship I am self representing in this court case matter and I live in Lightning Ridge which is about 800KM from the court registry.

So I am express posting to you all the original documents and a copy of all the documents for you to file and stamp the documents and send me back the copy in the self addressed envelope included so that I can serve the same on the other party. I thank you in advance for the act of your kindness for filing and stamping my court documents and for posting me the copies so that I can serve the same on the defendant.”


	
	While the court had filed these documents, all copies were still in the file, and clearly had not been returned to the plaintiff, nor had she been notified of the first return date. I was also not satisfied that the court had notified Dr White of McLoughlin SC DCJ’s orders. In those circumstances, I arranged for the plaintiff to be notified of the return date and for her to appear by telephone link so that I could determine how the matter should proceed.
	
	
	The orders I made on 28 November 2014 were as follows:
	



	
	Note the plaintiff was not told of the 7 November 2014 return date, or sent copies of the Statement of Claim for service, hence her non-appearance on 7 November 2014; inspection of the file confirms no correspondence was sent from the Court.
	
	
	Extend time for service of the statement of claim to Friday 19 December 2014.
	
	
	Direct the Court to provide sealed copies of the Statement of Claim forthwith.
	
	
	Refer the plaintiff to the NSW Bar Association for advice and assistance in the redrafting of the Statement of Claim and the future conduct of these proceedings, if appropriate.
	
	
	Judge Gibson to provide the NSW Bar Association with the Statement of Claim.
	
	
	Matter stood over for further directions to Friday 19 December 2014.
	



	
	As the plaintiff attended court by telephone link, the orders I made on 28 November 2014 were not only read to her but also explained, as well as being emailed to her by my associate. I encouraged the plaintiff to seek legal assistance from the NSW Bar Association because of the pleadings defects and limitation period problems. A copy of the statement of claim was provided to the NSW Bar Association by my associate.
	
	
	When the matter next came before me on 19 December 2014, the statement of claim had still not been served and I made the following orders:
	



	
	Note that the plaintiff has not yet served the statement of claim and extend time for service to Wednesday 18 February 2015.
	
	
	Matter stood over for further directions on Thursday 19 February 2015 at 2:00pm.
	
	
	Registry is to notify the plaintiff of these orders and that no further extensions of time will be granted without good cause.
	



	
	On 19 February 2015 the plaintiff appeared by telephone again. I granted her a further extension of time for service of the statement to Thursday 19 March 2015. As the plaintiff told me she was having trouble obtaining pro bono assistance from the NSW Bar Association (due to the vacation period and other difficulties), I arranged for enquiries to be made on the NSW Bar Associate Pro Bono Scheme. The NSW Bar Association Pro Bono Scheme retained Mr Smark SC, who has provided her with advice and assistance since that time. He has appeared before me this morning and I am indebted to him for his careful and helpful submissions on the plaintiff’s behalf.
	
	
	On 19 March 2015, Mr Smark SC appeared by telephone link. He advised that an Amended Statement of Claim had been prepared, and orders were made as follows:
	



	
	Extend time for service of any statement of claim in these proceedings to 9 April 2015.
	
	
	Extend time for the plaintiff to amend the statement of claim to 9 April 2015.
	
	
	Matter stood over for further directions on Thursday 16 April 2015 at 9:30am.
	
	
	Plaintiff is to notify the defendant of this return date.
	



	
	When the matter came before me on 16 April 2015, Ms Guo of counsel appeared for the plaintiff. Ms Guo sought a further extension of time for the plaintiff to serve the statement of claim. Ms Guo did her best to explain why the amended statement of claim had been served, but the principal difficulty seems to have been that the plaintiff was not returning email or telephone messages. As a result, the time for service of the statement of claim had now expired. The orders I made were as follows:
	



	
	Matter stood over to the Defamation List on Thursday 23 April 2015 at 9:30am, but decline to extend time for service further, noting the statement of claim is now both out of time and stale, and require the plaintiff to show cause why the proceedings should not be dismissed.
	
	
	Note Dr White is to be advised that her Statement of Claim will be struck out in the event of failure to show cause.
	


The proceedings before me today


	
	Mr Smark SC appeared for the plaintiff in his capacity as the provider of pro bono legal advice following the plaintiff’s consultation of the NSW Bar Association’s pro bono scheme. He acknowledged the difficulties of representing the plaintiff, as she had not returned his telephone calls or replied to his emails, although she had, in an earlier correspondence, indicated that her health problems now included eyesight problems for which she was considering consulting a medical practitioner.
	
	
	As a barrister, Mr Smark SC is not permitted to file documents. He may be able to file an amended pleading in court, but even if he had instructions to do so, such a step would be futile if the plaintiff continued to fail to serve the defendant. The reasons for the plaintiff continuing to fail to proceed with the filing and service of the amended pleading, in circumstances where Mr Smark SC has carefully explained these steps to her, are unknown.
	
	
	This puts the court, as well as Mr Smark SC, in a difficult position. While courts must assist persons who are effectively litigants in person, especially if they are in poor health, there is a fine line between assisting a litigant in person who does not understand the relevant procedures and actually running the case for them. Unfortunately, it now appears that these proceedings have crossed that line, in that the plaintiff is not prepared to move forward with the claim and to arrange for the filing and service of the amended statement of claim (or, if she preferred her own pleading, to serve the statement of claim she herself prepared, as I carefully preserved her right to do so if that was her wish).
	
	
	The obligations of courts and pro bono advisers to assist litigants in person need to be seen in the context of the adversary system. Litigants in person are increasingly common in defamation proceedings, and there have been many recent judgments in common law jurisdictions (such as Slipetz v Trudeau [2013] MBQB 111) and PW v MS [2014] WASC 202) where the court has sought to accommodate the needs of the litigant in person with the requirement for fairness to other litigants, noting the limited resources of the court. Some courts, such as the Queensland Supreme Court, have special lists for actions involving litigants in person; other courts, such as the Family Court of Australia, have special protocols and case management rules; other courts, such as the Federal Court, have referral systems as well as the “docket” system to ensure that case management errors do not occur in such cases. Courts are increasingly having to play a greater role in case management as a result. For courts which do not have special procedures for dealing with problems arising from the increasing number of litigants in person, heavy burdens are placed on registry and court staff to be vigilant and proactive. However, those obligations are not restricted to the litigant in person; they must be extended to the other parties in the litigation, and indeed to the resources of the court itself.
	
	
	This brings me to the issue for determination, namely the court’s motion for the plaintiff to show cause why these proceedings should not be summarily dismissed.
	


The relevant statutory provisions


	
	Rule 12.7(1) UCPR provides:
	


“(1) If a plaintiff does not prosecute the proceedings with due despatch, the court may order that the proceedings be dismissed or make such other order as the court thinks fit.”


	
	Section 61(3) Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW) provides:
	


“(3) If a party to whom such a direction has been given fails to comply with the direction, the court may, by order, do any one or more of the following:

(a) it may dismiss the proceedings, whether generally, in relation to a particular cause of action or in relation to the whole or part of a particular claim,

(b) it may strike out or limit any claim made by a plaintiff,

(c) it may strike out any defence filed by a defendant, and give judgment accordingly,

(d) it may strike out or amend any document filed by the party, either in whole or in part,

(e) it may strike out, disallow or reject any evidence that the party has adduced or seeks to adduce,

(f) it may direct the party to pay the whole or part of the costs of another party,

(g) it may make such other order or give such other direction as it considers appropriate.”


	
	The interaction of these provisions is explained by Bergin CJ in Baffico v YMCA of Great Lakes Inc [2014] NSWCA 61 at [35]-[37]:
	


“[35] If a party to whom such a direction has been given fails to comply with the direction the Court may, inter alia, dismiss the proceedings: s 61(3)(a) CPA. Similarly if a party fails to prosecute a case with due dispatch, the court may dismiss the proceedings: UCPR 12.7.

[36] Practice Note DC (Civil) No 1 Case Management in the General List was issued on 28 August 2009. It notes that the court aims to have cases completed within 12 months of commencement and that parties should expect to be allocated a trial date within 12 months of the commencement of proceedings and “plan to meet this time standard” (1.1; 1.2). The Practice Note refers to UCPR 15.12 and the obligation on plaintiffs in personal injury cases to serve particulars and supporting documentation on the defendant with the Statement of Claim or “as soon as practicable after the service” of it (2.3). The Practice Note requires the defendant to start preparing for trial based on the matters alleged in the Statement of Claim and the rule 15.12 particulars (2.4). It also notes the court’s expectation that in personal injury cases plaintiffs “will have served complete rule 15.12 or 15.13 particulars and primary medical reports and have qualified the experts who will prepare reports, including any liability or economic loss expert” (3.4).

[37] The Practice Note records that the court will generally order that final particulars under r 15.12 be filed and served before the Status Conference (8.8). It also records that cases “in which parties have failed to comply with court orders will be referred to the Civil List Judge at an early time” (11.2); and that where there has been non-compliance, the court may list the case for, relevantly, the plaintiff to show cause why the case should not be dismissed “for want of prosecution” (11.3).”


	
	The court’s power to require a party to show cause why proceedings should not be struck out for want of prosecution is one of long standing (National Parks and Wildife Service v Pierson (2002) 55 NSWLR 315 at [9]; for a recent example, see Re Application by Bar-Mordecai [2014] NSWSC 1202 at [5]). Where such an application is brought, evidence is commonly led in the form of an affidavit by a plaintiff.
	
	
	The plaintiff has had plenty of notice of the likelihood of such an action. While I refrained from making the orders foreshadowed by McLoughlin SC DCJ when the matter first came before me, the plaintiff was put on notice by my orders of 19 December 2014 that no further extensions would be granted without cause if there was further delay.
	
	
	Courts have increasing taken a firm line in relation to failure to conduct proceedings with dispatch where parties have been represented. This is particularly the case in defamation proceedings, as recent decisions of the NSW Court of Appeal demonstrate.
	
	
	In Coren v Master Builders Association of New South Wales Pty Ltd [2014] NSWCA 244, a plaintiff’s failure to answer a request for particulars for four months resulted in the proceedings being struck out, even though there was no prior history of delay or adverse costs orders, and the request for particulars was not part of a timetable. (Mr Coren was representing himself, but he had been a legal practitioner for many years). Similarly, in Dank v Cronulla Sutherland District Rugby League Football Club Ltd [2014] NSWCA 288, a plaintiff who had commenced proceedings promptly and have been given leave to administer special interrogatories but whose legal representatives failed to file the necessary documentation suffered the loss of the whole claim in relation to the relevant defendant.
	
	
	There are substantial problems with the claim in its present form. While I am prepared to infer that there may be some subject matter which falls within the limitation period prior to the filing of the statement of claim, most of the publications referred to in the statement of claim fall well outside not only the one year but three year limitation period. The time for service of the defendant expired on 9 April 2015. In that regard, the plaintiff was seeking an extension of time for service of the statement of claim (UCPR r 6.2(4)(b)(i)) in circumstances where the claim is both statute barred and stale.
	
	
	In relation to the relevance of the limitation period, Young JA explained in Weston in Capacity as Special Purpose Liquidator of One.Tel Ltd (in liq) v Publishing & Broadcasting Ltd (2012) 88 ACSR 80 at [20](4):
	


“The court must take into account the policy considerations underlying the relevant limitations statute. Thus, defendants or potential defendants should be made aware of claims against them within a reasonable time and liquidators who do not commence proceedings until just before expiry of the limitation period should be especially diligent in pursuing prompt service: Buzzle, at [37]–[39]; cited with approval in Kirk, at 410 [98]–[99].”


	
	His Honour went on to explain further in [27]-[28]:
	


“[27] Her Honour later found (at [325]) that the SPL, after weighing the advantages and disadvantages of the courses of action open to him, “chose to delay the service of the originating process and to keep it confidential”. Her Honour inferred (at [325]) that:

there was perceived to be a tactical advantage in keeping [the respondents] in the dark as to the claims it was then intended to bring against them.

[28] The primary Judge rejected (at [148]) a suggestion made by the SPL that the respondents should have asked the SPL for a copy of the statement of claim. The PBL respondents had unsuccessfully sought a copy from the court and the SPL (via reports to creditors) had stated that the claim would be kept confidential. In these circumstances:

no criticism can … be made of the [respondents] in failing to ask the SPL for it … [I]t was a matter for the SPL, if he wished to minimise the chance that extensions of time would be set aside, to make a copy available (on a confidential basis if thought necessary) to the [respondents] rather than waiting for them to ask for it.”


	
	I have not been provided with the statement of claim in its amended form, and how these problems have been resolved is unknown to me.
	
	
	In addition to the plaintiff failing to provide me (or to Mr Smark SC) with any material of assistance in relation to the show cause application, I note, having regard to the check list in Weston in Capacity as Special Purpose Liquidator of One.Tel Ltd (in liq) v Publishing & Broadcasting Ltd at [20] that:
	



	
	No attempts have been made at service;
	
	
	The delay in question appears to be both lengthy and deliberate;
	
	
	No notification has been given to the defendant; and
	
	
	There is a prior history of the plaintiff having other proceedings for defamation struck out due to her inactivity.
	



	
	Accordingly, even if I did not summarily dismiss the claim, this is not a case where a further extension of time for service of the statement of claim should be granted.
	
	
	No party should have his or her claim struck out without full and proper warning. However, the plaintiff has not only received warnings from this court, but suffered the loss of her first defamation action, by reason of failure to conduct the proceedings diligently. Additionally, she has had the benefit of pro bono advice from one of the most eminent senior counsel in defamation law, namely Mr Smark SC, as well as from the NSW Bar Association’s pro bono scheme.
	
	
	There must come a time when the plaintiff cannot expect any more help, and must act for herself. The plaintiff has failed to show cause and the proceedings must accordingly be dismissed.
	


Costs


	
	As no costs have been incurred for the opposing party in relation to the conduct of these proceedings, I make no order as to costs.
	


Orders


	
	Pursuant to s 61(3) Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW) and r 12.7(1) Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW), the proceedings are dismissed.
	
	
	No order as to costs.

CROWN AND DEFENCE CASES


	
	It was the Crown case that in early 2010 Kevin Gall was in possession of some items belonging to Neil Green (the deceased). Several attempts by the deceased and others on his behalf to collect these items had been unsuccessful. On 16 April 2010 the deceased and Michael Fox went to industrial premises at Girraween owned by Bruce Gall and occupied by Kevin Gall in a further attempt to retrieve the items. They were unarmed. Kevin Gall, who was not at the premises when they arrived, approached the back fence unannounced and fatally shot the deceased. He then fired at Mr Fox with intent to murder him as he made his escape.
	
	
	Kevin Gall’s case was that he operated a business at premises at Wiltona Place, Girraween which premises were owned by his father. He and the deceased had been friends but they had a falling out in 2009. Before his death, the deceased had been pressing him to sign a document which would assist the deceased in overcoming a drug supply charge which he was facing. Kevin Gall was unwilling to do so. On 16 April 2010 he learned that the deceased and another man were looking for him at the Girraween premises. He armed himself and went to those premises because he was worried about the safety of his father and his own safety. When he arrived at the premises, he shot the deceased in order to protect his father who was running from the deceased and because he believed that the deceased and the other man were carrying guns.
	


Factual background

The Relationship with the Deceased


	
	Kevin Gall gave evidence that he met the deceased in 2004 or 2005 through a mutual friend, Peter Van Straalan. They shared a common interest in motor bikes and it was expected that he could use his skills as a machinist to make parts for bikes. Until they fell out, the deceased was a regular visitor to Wiltona Place. During that time the deceased brought persons to Wiltona Place so that Kevin Gall could do work on their bikes and he and the deceased socialised together. He knew that the deceased was a member of the Nomads Motorcycle Club.
	
	
	On an occasion in 2006, the deceased brought a pistol to him which he repaired and test fired into a vacant allotment next door. Later the deceased asked him to increase the capacity of certain machine pistols but he was unable to do so. Kevin Gall said that the deceased asked him to hold a machine pistol, along with ammunition, a silencer and a bullet-proof vest, which he did.
	
	
	There was a dispute as to the cause of the falling out between the applicant and the deceased.
	
	
	An important Crown witness was Michael Fox, the person who accompanied the deceased to Wiltona Place. Mr Fox said it was his understanding that the friendship had soured over some drug charges. He understood that Kevin Gall and the deceased had been partying with prostitutes and others in a hotel room and that when they left the hotel, police had pulled the car over and found drugs in the boot. The deceased, who was driving, was charged with possession of the drugs but he maintained that they were not his.
	
	
	It was also Mr Fox’s understanding that Kevin Gall had some “stuff” that the deceased said belonged to him but which he had refused to return. Mr Fox offered to go to the Girraween premises to see what he could do to obtain the return of the “stuff”. He said that he did not know what the “stuff” was and did not want to know.
	
	
	There was police evidence that in April 2008 the deceased had been stopped while driving a car with Kevin Gall as his passenger and that various prohibited items had been found in the car including drugs. As a result, the deceased was charged with a number of offences including the possession of prohibited drugs but no charges had been brought against Kevin Gall.
	
	
	Mr Jones, who was a friend of the deceased, was aware of the falling out between the deceased and Kevin Gall. It was Mr Jones’s understanding that Kevin Gall was to sign a statement as a result of which the deceased expected that the drug charges against him would be dropped. Mr Jones also knew that the deceased considered that Kevin Gall had property of his that he wanted to retrieve. Although he had some suspicions about the property, he did not know precisely what that property was.
	
	
	There was evidence from Mr Lapich that some time in January or February 2010 he spoke to the deceased who asked him whether he had seen Kevin Gall. The deceased said “He has something of mine. I want it back. Tell him to ring me”. A couple of weeks later, Mr Lapich spoke to Kevin Gall at Wiltona Place and said “Neil wants you to ring him” to which he said “I don’t want to talk to him”.
	
	
	Kevin Gall’s evidence was somewhat different. He said that some months before 29 March 2010 he met with the deceased and two persons, who were people associated with the Nomads. They told him that they wanted him to swear an affidavit, which would help the deceased. They did not tell him what was going to be in the affidavit. They wanted him to go to a solicitor’s office and sign it. Kevin Gall said that he did not go. He was adamant that he was not going to “take the wrap” for the deceased’s drugs.
	
	
	The first time Mr Fox went to the Girraween premises, Kevin Gall was not there but Bruce was. Mr Fox said that he asked Bruce to get the “stuff” and then he would pick it up from him. Bruce said that he did not know anything about it. Mr Fox left his business card in the letterbox. A few days later, Mr Fox rang the home phone number at the Girraween premises. Bruce answered and said that the boys said to tell him “to get fucked”. The reference to “the boys” was to Kevin Gall and Troy Ryan.
	


Events of 16 April 2010


	
	The following is based upon the evidence of Mr Fox as to what happened on that day. At about lunchtime on 16 April 2010 he drove to the deceased’s home in Westmead in his blue Ford Laser. He asked the deceased if he was “carrying”, meaning armed, and the deceased said that he was not. He and the deceased drove to Wiltona Place. He left the keys in the ignition and had his wallet, passport and personal effects in the car but had brought no weapons.
	
	
	Only Bruce Gall was present. They first saw him standing in the driveway. The deceased told him to get the boys on the phone and to tell them to come over. Mr Fox could tell that Bruce was scared. He told Bruce that they were not armed and pulled up his shirt to show him. The deceased asked Bruce if he had any guns lying around and he said “no”. They took a look around the workshop but they did not see anything.
	
	
	Bruce asked what the property was that he wanted returned. The deceased said it was “two and a half”. When Bruce wanted that clarified, the deceased said “two and a half million” and he mentioned a couple of firearms. Mr Fox said there was “no way in the world” that he knew that they were there for an amount like that.
	
	
	Bruce went inside and rang Kevin Gall. He told them that he had spoken to Kevin and that he was coming. Mr Lapich was in the office when they arrived. He said that he wanted to go to a nearby workshop and the deceased offered to drive him there. Mr Fox waited with Bruce at the premises. After the deceased returned they waited another 10 minutes. The deceased said “they might come back like this” and made a shooting action with his hand. At that point Mr Fox realised that there was more to what was going on and he asked Bruce where he kept his guns.
	
	
	Mr Fox gave the following evidence as to what next happened:
	


“Q. What did Bruce say?

A. He said he didn't have any. I said, ""Yeah, right."" I said, ""I bet you keep one beside your bed, you old prick,"" and I started walking up to his back door and at that point Bruce, sort of said, ""Don't kick me door in,"" and I had no intention to kick it and I just started walking towards the shed and I thought he was going to get the keys and he broke into a trot and Neil started, sort of, ""Where the fuck are you going?"" And I started down the same sort of direction. Once he started running, I thought he was going to lock himself in the office, or get a gun, and that's when the shooter came over the fence and shot Neil.

Q. That's when the accused came over the fence and shot Neil?

A. That's correct.

Q. How far behind Neil were you?

A. Probably about four to six feet.

Q. Did you see where the bullets struck Neil?

A. I didn't see where the bullets struck him, but he was running face on to the direction of fire.

Q. So what happened when he was shot?

A. There were four to six shots and he went down after the first and the shoots kept coming.

Q. Where was the shooter positioned?

A. He was over a fence; on the other side of a fence; a divided fence with a neighbouring block.

Q. Did you see the shooter?

A. The top of his head and his arms and the barrel of the weapon.

Q. Did you recognise him?

A. No.

Q. Did you recognise the type of weapon he had?

A. Not at that stage, but when I got a closer look at it, when the dickhead run out of rounds, I'm trained in the use of firearms, and it looked to me like Baretta or Browning, something similar, with a slide action.

Q. What was the colour of the weapon?

A. It was a poorly maintained gun barrel grey.

Q. So if we could take it back a bit, you saw Neil struck and fall. You saw the shooter. You saw the gun. But you could not see who the shooter was at that stage?

A. Yeah, by the time I actually looked in that direction, the gun trained on me.

Q. What did you do then?

A. I ran out of the line of fire. Probably three shots were fired in my direction. I wasn't looking at the shooter at that stage, just where I was going. I ran down to the corner of the block. I was going straight over the fence, but being sort of, trained I thought I would try to talk my way out of it, so I turned and fronted on to that direction. As he came around the corner, I see what he was shooting for, or armed, and if he fired another shot at me, which forced me down on the ground behind the trailer. He kept on running down and by that stage he was standing over me with the weapon, pointing at me, screaming and shouting at me to get down, hands behind my head, and I sort of lost a bit of self control, I guess, because I was half complying and half not complying, and having been trained in conduct after capture

Q. So he was saying, ""Get down, hands behind your head""?

A. Yeah, ""Get on down,"" which I wasn't doing. I was staying on me feet and crashing down as though I was going to comply. My hands were behind my head. At that point I realised the slide on the weapon was to the rear and I noticed the slide was to the rear, which indicated to me that he was out of ammunition. At first I was, you know well, you work in split seconds. At first I thought I would attack him, but his old man was around the corner and I looked in his direction and he had another weapon in his hand and he gave me another option and I didn't see them and at that point I jumped up and over the fence and the shooter was shooting out, ""Shoot him, shoot him,"" and I had another three shots at me and I got around the corner.

Q. You mentioned that by that time his old man ran around the corner?

A. Yeah.” (T.39.7 – 40.30)


	
	Mr Fox said that he was next to a 6 – 8 foot high metal fence. He managed to get over the fence and went down 15 - 20 feet on the other side, got off the ground and ran for his life. There were three more shots as he ran and he felt gravel bouncing off the back of his legs. He cut his hand and arm when he went over the fence. Mr Fox ran to Portia Road, spoke to some people who let him use a phone to call a taxi and from there went to a friend’s workshop in Rouse Hill.
	
	
	Mr Fox did not inform the police about what had happened. He hoped the deceased had not been killed and had been dumped at a hospital or maybe escaped. He spent the next few days trying to locate the deceased. He went back to the Girraween premises late that night to try to recover his car but it was nowhere to be seen. Neither he nor the deceased made any threats to Bruce or Kevin that day.
	
	
	When cross-examined Mr Fox maintained that he did not know what the “stuff” was and said that as long as it was not drugs he did not care. He denied that he was there to lean on Kevin Gall to get him to sign a statement. He had never spoken to Bruce or Kevin Gall about signing a statement. He had only heard about the deceased’s drug charges in general conversation from others, not from the deceased.
	
	
	When the deceased said “two and a half million” that day, he realised that the matter was a lot more serious than he first thought. He said that the deceased had suffered a head injury and left a lot of things out that he [Fox] should have known that day. The deceased had not told him about the gravity of what they were there for. The deceased had not told him that other persons had previously gone to Wiltona Place to speak to Kevin Gall.
	
	
	Just before the deceased was shot, Mr Fox walked to the back of the building but the door was locked. He was coming back when he saw Bruce running towards the shed with the deceased running after him.
	


“Yeah the old man was probably 4 or 6 feet in front of Neil. He started running towards the shed and then he broke into a stride and I don’t know what frame of mind Neil was in but I thought he was going for a gun or whatever or going to lock himself in his office or something like that but he headed in that direction and then I heard gunshots that’s right.” (T.63.25)

Mr Fox did not hear Bruce Gall say anything to the effect that “he had guns”.


	
	Mr Fox thought it was likely that the deceased was dead or seriously injured. He did not call the police because if it turned out to be two and a half million dollars there were a lot more parameters to the situation that he did not know about. He did not know how the bike clubs dealt with their affairs and chose to stay out of it. He strongly disagreed that Bruce was not holding a gun. He refused to identify whom he first told about the shooting and refused to answer the proposition it was somebody from the Nomads. He did not make a statement until 9 November 2010. Even then he did not want to make a statement and it was not given willingly. He was under extreme duress from the Crime Commission to make the statement. He did not willingly provide the police with information because he was not privy to all the laws, rules and regulations of the bike club. He knew that the deceased would not have spoken to the police, so he just kept his mouth shut.
	
	
	Mr Fox disagreed that he went to Wiltona Place as “hired muscle”. He said that if the deceased had wanted to use muscle, he would have used the Nomads who were a lot more intimidating than he was. He denied that he had a gun that day. He denied that Bruce called out “Look out, he’s got a gun”. He estimated that it took between 20-30 seconds from the first shot being fired to the last shot. He denied that Kevin Gall yelled out to him to get on the ground before firing at him.
	
	
	Kevin Gall’s evidence as to what happened that day was different. He agreed that in 2009 he was travelling in a car driven by the deceased when they were stopped by the police. They had been partying at a nightclub and afterwards stayed the night at a hotel in the city. It was the next day that they were pulled over by the police for speeding. He had no idea what was in the car. When the police searched the car, he and the deceased were taken to the station and the deceased was charged. He was never made aware that the deceased had been charged with a “supply drugs” offence. After that incident, he and the deceased had less and less contact because he did not like what the deceased was getting into. He retained possession of a machine pistol which the deceased had given him.
	
	
	A few months before the deceased was due in court, he sent him a text message saying “Adrian and Lionel” wanted to see him. Adrian and Lionel were important members of the Nomads bike club. When Adrian and Lionel came to the Girraween premises, they sought to intimidate him and said that they wanted him to sign an affidavit for the deceased “to get him off the court thing”. He was supposed to go to a solicitor’s office to sign it, but he did not attend.
	
	
	Sometime later, Peter Van Straalen and another man came to his workshop on separate occasions asking for the deceased’s belongings and saying that the deceased wanted to see him. Mr Lapich told him that the deceased wanted to speak to him and he said that he did not want to see him. He said that because he did not want to have anything to do with making a statement. When Peter Van Straalen asked for the deceased’s belongings, he knew that he meant the machine pistol, the ammunition, silencer and bulletproof vest which he was holding for the deceased.
	
	
	Kevin Gall said:
	


“I didn’t want to hand back the weapons to the deceased. I believed he would be angry about me not turning up to the meeting with the solicitor and stuffing the boys around so I just held onto them … I thought, I believed that they could be used against me if I didn’t meet their demands.” (T.434.40)


	
	In early 2010 Bruce told him that Mr Fox had been to the workshop looking for him, that he had put a business card in the letterbox and that he wanted to speak to him.
	
	
	The deceased had once told him about an incident he had involving guns. The deceased said that he was chased by police and that he had taken a shot at someone. On another occasion, Kevin Gall had taken a registered firearm with him to a property where they were using their trail bikes. Both he and the deceased had fired some shots using the firearm.
	
	
	On the morning of 16 April 2010 he was at home when he saw some missed messages from Mr Lapich on his phone. When he read those messages, he immediately booked a taxi and left for the Girraween premises taking with him a .45 pistol. He had been taking that pistol everywhere in a shoulder bag after he missed the meeting with the solicitor to sign the document. He had it with him for protection because the deceased was high up in the Nomads club. He believed that the deceased was capable of violence and that he had connections with people who could do things for him. He had seen the deceased bash an older person on a previous occasion, punching him to the face several times. This was the only time he had seen the deceased engage in violent activity although he had heard that on another occasion, the deceased had gone to someone’s house and knocked the person’s tooth out.
	
	
	The firearm which the applicant took with him was possibly a FK 45. It was a blackish, semi-automatic firearm with a magazine capacity of 10-12. It had seven rounds in it that day. While he was in the taxi, he received a text message from Mr Lapich which said “Don’t come, Neil’s here”. He was worried about his father being there on his own and he asked if Troy was there to which Mr Lapich responded “No”. He did not make, nor receive, any other messages while in the taxi.
	
	
	He got out of the taxi near the Girraween premises, but not at them. He was worried about the Nomads hanging around the workshop. He believed that he would be taken by them or hurt in some way. He received a call from his father who sounded very worried and distressed and said “Neil is here and something very serious is about to happen”. Kevin Gall replied “I’ll be there soon”.
	
	
	He ran down the grass laneway, which ran from where he had left the taxi nearly all the way to the workshop. It was the fastest way he could get to his father. He then jumped a gate and ran across a paddock to the fence near the factory carport. He could not see anything at first and then his father came into view. He was at the corner of the green shed and then Michael Fox appeared with the deceased. Kevin Gall’s version of what then happened was as follows:
	


“Q. Did you see if they were armed at that stage?

A. I couldn't see from that, from where I was it wasn't that clear.

Q. Why wasn't it that clear?

A. The fence was in my way, I couldn't really, it has shrubs and stuff all over it, I was looking as best I could. I didn't really want to get discovered either as far as them.

Q. Were you looking over the fence or through the fence?

A. Over and through, both together.

Q. What happened next?

A. I seen Michael Fox and Neil Green and my father standing on the corner of where the green shed is and my father looked in complete distress, he didn't look normal, and Michael Fox was screaming at him to get into the house.

Q. What, if anything, do you remember being said?

A. Michael Fox was saying he wanted to get into the house. My father was saying ""No you're not going, you are not going in there"".

Q. Then what happened?

A. I seen Michael Fox leave, he walked to what appeared to be up to the house, like he stormed off, and my father had made a break for it and escaped from Neil Green.

Q. What happened at that point in time?

A. My father was running from Neil Green towards myself to get away from him and Neil Green was pursuing, him chasing him.

Q. Was anything said at this stage?

A. This is happening flat out, there was, there was nothing, my father when he was running, when he got closer to myself he screamed out ""he's got a gun"" and I believe he had a gun and my father ran up the stairs towards the office to get away from him and I, my only choice was to stop Neil Green from hurting my father and I opened fire towards Neil Green.

Q. How many shots did you fire?

A. Three.

Q. Whereabouts were the shots directed?

A. Downwards over the top of the fence and downwards.

Q. Did the shots hit his body?

A. I think so.

Q. What did you see as a result of the shots?

A. He fell down.

Q. How close together were the shots?

A. One after the other.

Q. At the time you fired the gun did you see at that point in time whether or not Neil was armed or not?

A. No.

Q. Why was it then that you fired the shots at that point in time?

A. I believe Neil Green was armed with a gun.

Q. What caused you to have that belief?

A. My father had told me that as he was running for his life.” (T.443.3 – 444.12)


	
	He jumped the fence and chased Mr Fox because he believed he was going to do something else. He tried to stop him from leaving because he did not know what he was planning to do. He said “get on the ground” several times but Mr Fox would not comply. Before he could react, Mr Fox had jumped over the fence. He fired two shots into the air but Mr Fox did not stop.
	
	
	He said:
	


“Q. The incident you just described in terms of Michael Fox being down in the back corner area and you firing the gun do you recall where your father was at that time?

A. I believe he was coming down from the office.

Q. Do you recall where your father was when you fired the gun at the fence line?

A. Not exactly.

Q. Did you see whether your father had a weapon at this stage?

A. I didn't see any weapon.

Q. Did your father have a weapon?

A. No.

Q. What happened then after Michael Fox disappeared?

A. I was in a panic state of mind, I didn't know what to think, I just thought there would be hundreds of Nomads about to turn up so I just grabbed Neil, picked him up and put him in the white van that was at work.

Q. What did you do with him in the van?

A. I just took off then buried him out in the bush.” (T.445.21 - .43)


	
	The evidence of Mr Jones and Mr Lapich confirmed that at about 1pm the deceased used Mr Fox’s blue Ford Laser to drop Mr Lapich off at P & L Cycles. Mr Jones worked there as a motorbike mechanic. After the deceased had left P & L Cycles, Mr Lapich telephoned Kevin Gall and advised that the deceased was at the Girraween premises and was “with a big guy”.
	
	
	There was evidence from persons who worked and lived near the Girraween premises as to what they heard and saw.
	
	
	Ms Schensher was working on her computer in an upstairs office at Wiltona Place next to the Gall premises in April 2010 when she heard yelling and about four or five loud bangs. They sounded like gunshots. She heard a male voice yelling something like “get down on the ground” then she heard the gunshots or bangs.
	
	
	Ms Schensher went to the window and looked in the direction of the Gall premises because that was where the noise was coming from. She knew Bruce Gall as someone she would wave and say hello to. She said:
	


“A. Yeah, with the yelling going on I couldn't see anything but then I went to the window. I did see a young man jump over the fence, and next to Bruce's factory place there is like a little vacant block of land and he ran in that direction, over that, and then, not long after that I saw another man come to the fence, the same fence where the first one had jumped over and he swung a gun over he was holding a gun in his hand with the arm over and was leaning over the fence and shooting in the direction of the first man.” (T.117.32)


	
	She thought she probably heard two shots. There were a couple of seconds between the man jumping over the fence and the other man coming over. When the man with the gun came to the fence, “he was sort of leaning on it”. She was not sure if he was standing on something. Her view of the man became obscured by a storage unit which was located at the back of the premises. She agreed that at the time she heard the shots being fired, she could not see the man who was running away. She saw that the shots were being fired in the direction she had seen the man heading before he disappeared from view.
	
	
	Victor Gilbert was Ms Schensher’s boss. He was on the ground floor of the business premises when on 16 April 2010 he heard three shots. At that time he was on the phone to Terry Banders who was in Western Australia. Mr Banders thought that he heard three or four shots over the phone close together. Mr Gilbert thought the sound of the shots was coming from the Galls’ premises. Mr Gilbert looked in the direction of where the shots came from. He saw a man jump over the fence and he saw Kevin Gall on the fence holding a gun and firing shots at the man who jumped the fence. Once the man had jumped the fence, Mr Gilbert could no longer see him because he [Mr Gilbert] was at ground level.
	
	
	Mr Gilbert obtained Bruce Gall’s phone number from another employee and rang him. His evidence was:
	


“Q. Did you make a telephone call to someone?

A. Oh, sorry yes I rang up, I spoke, I actually had Bruce's number so, I had an employee up the shop at the time, I asked him what Bruce's number was and he gave me the number and I rang up Bruce.

Q. What did you say to Bruce?

A. I said what are you guys doing making a cowboy movie or something.

Q. What did Bruce say to you if anything?

A. He said no, it was a car back firing, and I said are you okay and he said oh, yeah I will talk to you later.

Q. Did he ever discuss this matter with you later?

A. No.” (T.136.46 – 137.9)


	
	Mr David Attwood had an inflatable boat business near to the Galls’ premises. He knew Bruce Gall as his neighbour and owned a twenty foot container which was kept on the premises. On 16 April 2010, early in the morning, he heard loud shouting from a single male voice. He then heard more than one gunshot. He had been in the Army and Navy and was familiar with firearms. The gunshots came from the direction of Bruce’s factory. He was concerned for Bruce and he walked out of his factory to see what he could see.
	
	
	As he was walking out, he dialled triple 0 and asked for the police. He stood on some strips of wood and had a clear view over the fence. He turned his phone off because of what he saw. He heard Kevin Gall say “stay there, stay underneath it”. Immediately after that, a man “barrel rolled” over the fence and a few seconds later the heads of Kevin and Bruce appeared. The man was moving extremely fast and basically he just got over the top and partially rolled over the fence and he was gone.
	
	
	His evidence was:
	


“Q. What happened then, sir?

A. Well, Kevin and Bruce, they appeared at the fence, so I could see their heads clearly. Kevin had a gun in his hand and shot in the direction where the chap had rolled over and was presumably running away.

Q. How many shots were fired at that stage?

A. Again, more than one, but I don't know the exact number.

Q. About how many metres were you from Kevin and Bruce when you saw this?

A. Approximately 30 metres, I would say.

Q. Was anything obstructing your view?

A. No.

Q. You say you didn't see where the man went after he got over the fence and presumably landed?

A. That's right, yes.

Q. Was there anything obstructing your view of him?

A. There's another fence - I don't know what you call it, a culvert, a hollow - so if you fell into that area you would be hidden from view.

Q. How many metres, or centimetres, were there between Bruce and Kevin?

A. They were right next to each other.

Q. Did you see the type of gun that Kevin had in his hand?

A. It would have been a pistol or a revolver.

Q. Did you see the colour of it?

A. No.

Q. Could you see Bruce Gall's hands?

A. No.

Q. How much of his body could you see?

A. Well, I could clearly see above shoulder height.

Q. How much of Kevin Gall's body could you see?

A. About the same; from the top of his shoulders.

Q. How many of Kevin's arms and hands could you see?

A. He was clearly holding the pistol, so you could see his arm, but I couldn't tell you whether he had another arm over the fence or not.

Q. What did you do after this happened, sir?

A. Well, I suppose I was shell shocked. I went back into the factory and you think; well, what do you do now, do you know what I mean? I did nothing.” (T.168.1 - .49)

Events following the shooting


	
	Kevin Gall gave evidence as to what happened after the shooting. The body of the deceased was on the walkway near the office. He was not moving. The van into which he placed him was a white Mazda with false number plates. He had bought it years earlier and it was unregistered. Mr Fox’s car was parked in the back towards the house. He left everything in the car. He had no idea where his father was while he was putting the body of the deceased into the van. He was in a panicked state and was terrified that the Nomads would be around very soon. He was worried for his own safety and that of his father.
	
	
	He drove for four hours to a place called Coolongolook near Forster. He drove off the road onto a track into the bush. He buried the deceased using a shovel from work. On the way back, he pulled the gun apart and threw the pieces out the window. He estimated that he was at the burial site in the bush for about 10 - 12 hours.
	
	
	He later tried his “absolute best” to show police where he had buried the body but could not find the spot. He estimated that he was away from the Girraween premises for somewhere between 18 and 24 hours.
	
	
	He first spoke to Peter Van Straalen two days after the shooting. Peter came around and wanted to know what was happening. He did not tell him anything but asked if he could help out with Mr Fox’s car, which was still at the Girraween premises and still had everything in it. Mr Van Straalen suggested getting rid of the car because he was worried about Mr Lapich’s DNA being in it. He was worried that Kevin Gall would not get rid of the car properly and wanted to do it himself.
	
	
	There were six CCTV cameras operating at the workshop at Wiltona Place on 16 April 2010. After the shooting, Kevin Gall did not look at the CCTV because there was no need. The CCTV was set up to record only at night time. He was not able to comment on evidence that the CCTV hard drive seized by police had no data recorded on it. He had “no idea” about that.
	
	
	He believed that the fired cartridge cases that the police located at the Girraween premises on 7 May 2010 and 16 November 2010 were those he and the deceased had fired many years earlier when testing the machine pistol, silencer and magazine which were found at the premises. After shooting the deceased, he collected some of the five cartridge cases and squashed them in a vice and threw them in a bin.
	
	
	On 23 April 2010 Kevin Gall’s home was firebombed by the Nomads. His girlfriend called the police and they were already there when Kevin Gall came home. He did not tell the police the entire truth about what had happened because the Nomads were involved and he was extremely fearful of them. Thereafter Kevin Gall, his girlfriend and Troy resided at the Girraween workshop.
	
	
	On 6 May 2010 the police searched the Girraween premises and located a black 9mm calibre automatic weapon, a silencer and a magazine holding 11 cartridges. This was the machine pistol which Kevin Gall was holding for the deceased. He was also in possession of a .32 automatic self-loading pistol. He was in possession of those weapons because his house had been firebombed by the Nomads. He was worried about his own safety and that of his father, his girlfriend and Troy.
	
	
	In cross-examination Kevin Gall agreed that he had completely pulled the white van to pieces within a week of disposing of the deceased’s body. This was because he had not wrapped the body in anything and there was blood in the back of the van.
	
	
	Kevin Gall realised that he would have to do something about the Ford Laser belonging to Mr Fox. He painted the car white using spray cans, changed the number plates and cut out the VIN and the engine number. He started to modify the car as soon as he got back from burying the deceased’s body. He dealt with Mr Fox’s car before destroying the van he used to transport the deceased’s body.
	
	
	The police subsequently found the Ford Laser and it was common ground at the trial that subsequent to the killing of the deceased, Kevin Gall had tried to disguise that car.
	
	
	He denied having any conversation with his father concerning blood in the carport area. He said “I didn’t see any blood there”.
	
	
	Ms Schensher went back to the window to see what was happening next door on a number of occasions. After the shooting, she saw Bruce and it looked to her like he was using a hose of some sort and was washing the carport area:
	


“A. Well I couldn't see a hose but I could see him and it looked to me that is what he was doing and I could hear it sounded like water or maybe using a high pressure hose I am not sure.” (T.119.15)

She saw Bruce and heard a sound which was like what one would hear if someone were hosing down cement. She also saw a white van leave the property. In the van was a driver and the man who was the shooter. She did not know this person.


	
	Mr Buhagiar gave evidence that he used the corner of the back shed on the Girraween premises and rented the space from Bruce Gall. He was not at work on Friday, 16 April 2010 but when he returned on Monday, 19 April he notice that an area under the carport next to the office had been cleaned. He spoke to Bruce Gall about it saying:
	


“I just said oh, you done a cleaning job here. He said “yeah to get rid of the oil from the forklift.”


	
	Mr Edward Clarke worked in security systems and alarm installations. He had known Bruce Gall for many years. In 2009 he installed security cameras for him at the Girraween premises. On Sunday, 18 April 2010 he received a telephone call from Bruce Gall to say three of his cameras were not working. He attended the property next day and found that the power supply for the camera in front of the house had blown. Two cameras in the shed were powered by the same power supply which meant that they had stopped working as well. He did not ask Bruce what had happened but determined that the power supply was not working and replaced it. He denied changing any of the hard drives for the cameras at the premises. (He had been accused of changing the hard drives by the police, an accusation which he denied.) He said that should a hard drive break down, he would send it back to the manufacturer to get changed.
	
	
	In June 2010 Kevin Gall was present at a meeting at Peter Van Straalen’s house with Peter, Mr Lapich and Bruce. The conversation was recorded by a police listening device (exhibit AC). Mr Lapich was worried and said “If I messaged you or rang you and said Neil is here they would hold me responsible for his death”. Kevin Gall understood that to mean that Adrian and Lionel from the Nomads would hold Mr Lapich responsible for the death of the deceased. Kevin Gall advised Mr Lapich to get rid of his phone. He gave that advice because Mr Lapich was worried and he wanted to ease his mind and provide a solution for him.
	
	
	When he was asked about what he had said to Mr Lapich in Exhibit AC Kevin Gall gave this evidence:
	


“Q. Coming back to where we are now in the listening device, when you are talking about Lapo's phone why didn't you advise Lapo to go to the police?

A. Neil’s friends and myself, being a mate of Neil's, he always said you never talk to the police. That is just something we all, I don't know, adopted I guess you would call it.

Q. At page 15, bottom of page 15, there is a reference to ""there is no way that car can show up"" you understand that is a reference to Michael Fox's car?

A. Yes.

Q. Reference to DNA going then over the page from you ""KG: It won't"". ""PV It's not going to turn up"". Then you ""KG: You never, ever. Dust"". That is page 16 of the listening device?

A. Correct.

Q. What were you trying to convey at that point of time?

A. I was concerned for Pete and he was worried about it and he was stressing out about it turning up and getting rid of it and he basically wanted to take care of it.

Q. Those words you use at page 16 ""Never, ever. Dust"" what did you mean by that?

A. That I was going to pull it apart.

Q. Is that what you did?

A. No.

Q. Moving forward to page 17. Two thirds down the page is a reference attributed to you ""That 'phone where is it?"" The next entry is Martin Lapich in there so you were talking about the 'phone to Martin Lapich?

A. That is correct.

Q. Going over the page you are recorded as saying ""Well, I would fuck that off and get a new phone. Say it got damaged. Get rid of it cause if there is anything in it, in anyway that they can get anything from it and download"". What were you saying there?

A. I was basically telling Lapo just to say it was damaged if the police had asked him about it. He was obviously worried about his 'phone and information for whatever reason that he had on there and I was advising him to get rid of it.

Q. Why were you advising him to get rid of it?

A. For himself so he wouldn't feel linked to anything I guess.

Q. And you accept that entry there is part of the charge of pervert the course of justice that you pleaded guilty to?

A. I do yes.”

(T.465.35 – 466.31)


	
	On page 19 of Exhibit AC Bruce Gall made suggestions to Mr Lapich of ways in which he could persuade the police that he had not been at the Girraween premises on 16 April 2010. He suggested that the text messages could have been sent while he was walking from Mr Van Straalen’s premises to the station.
	
	
	Page 20 of Exhibit AC set out a discussion between Bruce Gall and Mr Van Straalen, the effect of which was to indicate that Bruce Gall did not believe that the deceased and Mr Fox had any guns, or any other weapons, but rather that they were looking for his guns and that they wanted to search his premises to look for them.
	
	
	Kevin Gall was cross-examined as to the contents of p 32 of Exhibit AC. The following was recorded on the exhibit:
	


“PV: Adrian promised me if there was any trouble he wasn’t going to touch the old man and that Kev you know I came and told you that.

KG: Yeah you did.”

When cross-examined as to that exchange, Kevin Gall could not remember it and disagreed that he was not genuinely fearful for his father (T.493.30-.40)


	
	In cross-examination Kevin Gall was taken to p 37 of Exhibit AC and the following exchange between him and Mr Van Straalen:
	


“PV   Ok, lets square it up. The cars gone Martin. Kev says the cars gone. It’s f’ing destroyed. Ok …you in the car. They have checked. They reckon there’s no cameras anywhere. No-one saw you get in the car. What about your film things at home. That things destroyed?

KG   Gone.

BG   Gone.

PV   Not just wiped off.

KG   It’s gone, it’s not there. The hard drive’s gone.

BG   The whole thing’s gone.

PV   Ok, so their things … The cameras would of seen you in the car, they’re gone.”


	
	Kevin Gall explained that conversation by saying that the CCTV cameras at the Wiltona Place premises only recorded at night via infrared because it was pointless to record during the day. He was unaware that by the time the police seized the hard drive for the CCTV, the hard drive had been removed and a different one had been installed. He had no idea about that and did not know anything about it (T.522).
	


CONVICTION GROUNDS OF APPEAL

Ground 1 - Her Honour erred in failing to direct the jury regarding the appellant’s post offence conduct in the terms of consciousness of guilt, reasoning.


	
	Kevin Gall accepted that no such complaint had been made during the trial and that leave pursuant to r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 was required. The applicant submitted that because this error had given rise to a miscarriage of justice, leave should be granted.
	
	
	Kevin Gall submitted that this ground related to the evidence concerning:
	



	
	Disposal of the deceased’s body.
	
	
	The removal of the hard drive from the CCTV camera at the crime scene.
	
	
	Destruction of the cartridge cases.
	
	
	The destruction of the van used to transport the body of the deceased.
	
	
	The spray painting of the Ford Laser which Mr Fox drove to the Girraween premises.
	



	
	Kevin Gall reviewed what her Honour had said about each of those matters in her summing up:
	


Disposal of Body

“Despite several attempts to locate the body so that it could be exhumed and a post mortem undertaken, the body was never located. Detective Sergeant O’Donohoe gave evidence about the time spent by police and cadaver dogs with handlers to find the body. It was never recovered.

One of the consequences of the disposal of the deceased’s body and the fact that it was not recovered was that the police were unable to determine the calibre of the weapon used to kill him or the number of shots that had been fired into his body.” (SU 218-219)

Destruction of cartridge cases

“The other, what might be described as evidence that was destroyed or which you might think was destroyed was the fired cartridge cases and you will recall that Mr Kevin Gall said in evidence that he collected some of the fired cartridge cases and squashed them up in a vice in the workshop and threw them in a bin.” (SU 227)

Destruction of the white van

“There was also evidence concerning the white van which Mr Kevin Gall used to transport the body of the deceased. Exhibit AK shows the photograph of the white van which appears to have been the same white van.

The accused Mr Kevin Gall’s evidence is that he stripped the van into pieces. Detective Sergeant O’Donohoe gave evidence that police have been unable to locate the vehicle which remains outstanding.” (SU 228-229)

The Ford Laser

“As between the Crown and the accused Kevin Gall it is agreed that on 9 July 2010 Kevin Gall drove a Ford Laser to Chifley Street Smithfield and left it in that location. It was the same vehicle that had been driven to Wiltona Place by Michael Fox and Neil Green on Friday 16 April 2010. It was then towed away by Mr Aplin (exhibit S).” (SU 231)

“Detective Sgt O’Donohoe gave evidence that the registration plate of the Ford Laser had been removed and a different one substituted.” (SU 232)

“On 9 August 2010 Mr Craig Sherwood, Crime Scene Officer, conducted an examination of the Ford Laser. The external panels of the car had been spray painted in grey and beige primer. The instrument cluster had been removed. The vehicle identification number had been deliberately cut away. The engine number had been broken away from the engine block. The manufacturer’s identification and compliance plates had been removed from the firewall panel.” (SU 233)

“The Ford Laser was ultimately tested and Michael Fox’s DNA found in the vehicle.” (SU 234)

“Mr Kevin Gall admitted in cross-examination that he had cut the VIN out of the Ford Laser the day he returned from Nabiac. He said that he had done so because Peter Van Straalen had told him to.” (SU 235)

“As you recall from the Crown address the Crown says that the accused Kevin Gall spray painted the car and removed distinguishing features to disguise it so that no-one would know that the deceased who came in the car to Wiltona Place had been there that day and no-one would be able to connect the deceased with the car and with the location and with the accused Mr Kevin Gall …” (SU 236)

“But in all events Mr Johnstone (counsel for Kevin Gall) says and I’ll remind you about that when I come to address, that really all of this does not matter because Mr Kevin Gall made an admission that the Ford Laser that was driven to 8 Wiltona Place was the same one that was recovered and tested for DNA.” (SU 238)


	
	Kevin Gall submitted that because the jury found him guilty of murder and of discharging a firearm with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, they must have rejected his evidence that he did not actually shoot at Mr Fox and must have rejected his evidence that he shot at the deceased to protect his father whom he said had told him the deceased had a gun. That being so, he submitted that inferentially the jury must have used his post offence conduct to corroborate the evidence of Mr Fox, causing them to reject his evidence on these questions and to have concluded that his actions demonstrated an intent to kill the deceased and to shoot at Mr Fox. He submitted that such a line of reasoning was the same as that involving lies told out of a consciousness of guilt (R v Cook [2004] NSWCCA 52 at [25]).
	
	
	He submitted that her Honour invited this type of reasoning when she said in her summing up:
	


“However the Crown relies on these matters to show that whoever destroyed or disposed of the evidence knew that what he had done was wrong and was trying to hide the wrongdoing.” (SU 213)


	
	He submitted that in those circumstances the jury should have been directed that they could only use these matters against him if they found that he did these things out of a consciousness of guilt of the actual offences with which he had been charged and not out of fear of retribution from the Nomads. He submitted that on the facts of this case that was a critical consideration and the failure to direct the jury as to consciousness of guilt constituted a miscarriage of justice requiring a re-trial. He submitted that with respect to the murder charge, this post offence conduct was not logically available to distinguish between a consciousness of guilt of murder, as opposed to manslaughter, on the basis of excessive self-defence and a direction should have been given by her Honour to make the distinction clear.
	


Consideration


	
	In order to properly assess this ground of appeal, it is necessary to understand the rationale behind the need for a “consciousness of guilt” direction by a trial judge. A helpful analysis of that rationale is to be found in the judgment of Simpson J (Ipp JA and Adams J agreeing) in R v Cook.
	
	
	In a case involving the offence of threatening to inflict actual bodily harm with an offensive weapon with intent to have sexual intercourse, the Crown made it clear that it was going to rely upon evidence of flight by the accused to indicate consciousness of guilt. At [21] Simpson J set out what Gleeson CJ had said in R v Heyde [1990] 20 NSWLR 234 as follows:
	


““If, by evidence or admission, it is proved that an accused person has told a lie, that is to say, made a deliberately false statement, in Court or out of Court, then, provided various conditions are fulfilled, the jury may regard the lie as demonstrating a consciousness of guilt and may treat the lie as corroboration. … However, common sense and ordinary human experience indicate that a judgement as to whether a lie reveals a consciousness of guilt, although one which people not infrequently make, may, depending upon all the circumstances, be very difficult. People tell lies for many reasons other than a consciousness of guilt. For example, a person may tell lies to escape a false accusation, just as a person may be put to flight by the threat of unjust arrest.”


	
	Thereafter, Simpson J set out the conditions to which Gleeson CJ had referred and added one of her own:
	


(i)    that the lie is deliberate;

(ii)    that it relates to a material issue;

(iii)    that the motive for the lie is a realisation of guilt and a fear of the truth;

(iv)    (where relevant) that it is shown to be a lie by evidence other than that of an accomplice who is to be corroborated, that is, by admission or by evidence from an independent witness.

(v)   the lie must be capable of being seen as indicating consciousness of guilt of the specific offence for which the accused is charged.


	
	As Simpson J pointed out at [25] those conditions, which were referred to in the context of lies indicating a consciousness of guilt, are readily adaptable to other conduct which could rationally lead to the same conclusion. Her Honour said:
	


“25   The principles developed in relation to evidence of lies are readily adaptable to the circumstance where the Crown tenders evidence of flight said to be indicative of a consciousness of guilt. Evidence of flight may be admitted where the jury may legitimately infer that the flight was occasioned by consciousness in the accused person of guilt – that is, of guilt of the offence with which he/she is charged. …”


	
	In other words, the rationale behind the need for a consciousness of guilt direction by a trial judge is that the particular conduct relied upon by the Crown, while being capable of allowing a legitimate inference of guilt, may also be readily explained by another innocent or less culpable motivation. When that rationale is kept in mind, a proper understanding of the issues which arose in this trial makes it clear that there was no need for a consciousness of guilt direction by her Honour and that no miscarriage of justice has occurred by her Honour not having done so.
	
	
	Before her Honour commenced her summing up, there was a discussion with trial counsel as to its content. The overwhelming inference is that no counsel at trial considered that a consciousness of guilt direction was necessary, otherwise they would have raised the issue. It is trite to observe that not every case in which evidence of post offence conduct is adduced requires a consciousness of guilt direction. The direction is only required when it is necessary in order to ensure a fair trial in the light of the issues and evidence in the trial.
	
	
	There was no question in this trial of the post offence conduct of Kevin Gall “corroborating” the evidence of Mr Fox or any other Crown witness. In any event, the evidence was not capable of doing so. Such an approach misunderstands the fundamental issue in the trial.
	
	
	Kevin Gall admitted that he had shot the deceased. He admitted that he fired shots thereafter and that Mr Fox was running away. This was at a time when there was eyewitness evidence confirming not only that Mr Fox was running away but that Kevin Gall appeared to be shooting in his direction. The relevant actus reus was established. The crucial issue at trial was whether the Crown had negated Kevin Gall’s contention that he had carried out these actions in order to defend himself and his father out of a genuine fear of the Nomads.
	
	
	The issue before the jury was the intention of Kevin Gall at the relevant time. There was no issue as to whether or not he had carried out the relevant act. On his case, the apparently sinister actions of shooting at both the deceased and Mr Fox had an innocent or less culpable explanation. The issue for the jury was whether the Crown had negated that less culpable explanation to the relevant standard, i.e. beyond reasonable doubt. Part of the Crown case to achieve that result was its reliance upon the post offence conduct. The issue was not whether a less culpable explanation for the post offence conduct was available – it was and it constituted the basis of Kevin Gall’s defence. The jury had to decide whether the Crown had excluded that less culpable explanation.
	
	
	The difference between the cases of the Crown and Kevin Gall was stark. On the Crown case, he shot the deceased to remove an adversary. On Kevin Gall’s case, he did so out of fear of what might happen to his father and himself. An important part of the Crown case was the post offence conduct to establish Kevin Gall’s intention. When the issue before the jury was as clear as this, to have given a consciousness of guilt direction would have needlessly complicated the question which the jury had to decide. It would have involved a circularity of reasoning, i.e. the jury could only be satisfied as to consciousness of guilt if they were also satisfied that Kevin Gall had the intent necessary for murder.
	
	
	It would involve the triumph of form over substance and an empty exercise in semantics to require a trial judge in the circumstances of this case to give a direction to the jury that the post offence conduct of Kevin Gall, while capable of giving rise to an inference of guilt of murder, was also capable of giving rise to a less serious or even innocent inference and for that direction to be couched in consciousness of guilt terminology. This is because that very issue was the fundamental question for the jury to decide. They were well aware of the competing issues as to intent as a result of the addresses by counsel and her Honour’s comprehensive summary of the competing cases in relation to which there has been no complaint. The evidence of Kevin Gall’s post offence conduct was simply part of the Crown’s case to rebut his contention that he had acted out of fear and in self-defence.
	
	
	Kevin Gall’s submission that the evidence of his post offence conduct could not distinguish between a consciousness of guilt for murder or manslaughter is misconceived. At no time was it suggested by any counsel or her Honour to the jury that the post offence conduct could be used in this way or was capable by itself of establishing guilt of any particular offence. It was simply part of the Crown’s overall case to establish Kevin Gall’s intention at the relevant time and to establish the negative proposition beyond reasonable doubt that Kevin Gall did not personally believe that it was necessary for him to shoot at the deceased to defend his father and himself.
	
	
	Her Honour’s summing up as to manslaughter was at [274] – [285]. No complaint as to this part of the summing up was made at trial, nor in the appeal, nor could there be.
	
	
	Her Honour gave clear, accurate and comprehensive directions as to the state of mind of Kevin Gall at the time of offending and as to the onus and burden of proof. She gave all the necessary warnings. She was not required to do any more and in particular, she was not required in the circumstances of this case to say anything about “consciousness of guilt reasoning”. I would grant leave to raise this ground of appeal but dismiss it.
	


Ground 2 – Her Honour erred in failing to direct the jury that they could not use the fact his father and co-accused, Bruce Gall, did not give evidence against the appellant.


	
	Kevin Gall accepted that leave was required pursuant to r 4 to rely upon this ground since this issue was not raised at trial. He submitted that since this ground raised a potential miscarriage of justice, leave should be granted.
	
	
	Kevin Gall submitted that there was a risk that the jury would misuse the fact that Bruce Gall did not give evidence in support of his account. He submitted that there was a risk that the jury might have used the fact that Bruce Gall did not give evidence that he had told him that the deceased had a gun, as indicating that he [Bruce Gall] had not said any such thing. Kevin Gall submitted that if the jury reasoned in that way, this would almost certainly have led the jury to convict him of murder. He submitted that what her Honour said in the summing up at [40] – [44] was insufficient since it only related to the effect of Bruce Gall not giving evidence in the case against him. It said nothing about what use the jury could make of that fact in the case against him [Kevin Gall].
	
	
	Kevin Gall submitted that Bruce Gall’s failure to give evidence corroborating what he [Kevin Gall] had said and her Honour’s failure to explain the implications of that to the jury were grossly prejudicial to his case in circumstances where his father was not a compellable witness in that case. Kevin Gall submitted that the jury should have been directed in the clearest terms that they must not use the silence of Bruce Gall against him and that it would be quite unfair and wrong for them to do so. He submitted that her Honour should have explained that he [Kevin Gall] was not in a position to require his father to give evidence in his trial and that his father might have quite independent reasons why he did not want to give evidence in the presentation of his own case that had nothing to do with the presentation of Kevin Gall’s case.
	


Consideration


	
	Her Honour said the following in relation to Bruce Gall not giving evidence:
	


“40   You will have noticed that Mr Bruce Gall did not give evidence. He has not given any explanation by himself giving evidence in response to the Crown’s case. There are a number of important directions of law which I must give you in relation to that.

41   An accused person may always, by giving evidence or calling other evidence, make a response to the case presented by the Crown by way of an explanation for the whole or parts of the Crown case, but there is no obligation to do so. As I have already pointed out, the Crown bears the onus of satisfying you beyond reasonable doubt that the accused is guilty of the offence with which he is charged.

42   The accused bears no onus. The accused is presumed to be innocent until you have been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt by the Crown of his guilt.

43   Although the accused may give evidence in relation to the whole or any part of the Crown’s case by way of explanation for it or by way of additional matters which the accused may wish to raise, he may equally elect to give no such explanation nor call any evidence in that regard. The accused is entitled to say nothing and make the Crown prove his guilt.

44   I direct you, as a matter of law, that the accused Mr Bruce Gall’s silence in Court and his election not to call evidence apart from that of the Sheriff’s officers cannot be used against him. The accused’s election not to offer an explanation of the whole or any part of the Crown’s case by giving evidence (or by calling evidence) constitutes no admission by him and no such inference must be drawn from that fact. Nor must such an election be used by you to fill gaps in the evidence tendered by the Crown and it may not be used as a makeweight in assessing whether the Crown has proved its case beyond reasonable doubt.

45   You must not speculate about what might have been said in evidence if the accused had given evidence.”


	
	Those directions by her Honour were given in clear and, with respect, forceful terms. Of particular importance were the directions at [44] – [45]. Her Honour’s directions that the election not to give evidence could not be used to fill gaps in the Crown case and that the jury should not speculate as to what might have been said in evidence if Bruce Gall had given evidence, are important. There is no reason why the jury would have disregarded those directions had they thought about the effect on Kevin Gall’s case of Bruce Gall not giving evidence.
	
	
	Against that background, there is no reason to suppose that the jury used the fact that Bruce Gall did not give evidence against Kevin Gall. There is nothing about the conduct of the trial, the directions that were given or any submissions made that would give rise to such a reasoning process. The ground of appeal can only be based upon speculation.
	
	
	On this issue, it is also useful to have regard to what her Honour said about separate trials:
	


“12   As I trust I have emphasised throughout the course of these proceedings, there are two separate trials proceeding before you. For reasons of convenience, taking into account the number of witnesses in common, each of the trials of Kevin Gall and the trial of Bruce Gall have been heard jointly. I repeat that you must consider the case against each accused man separately. There is no reason why your verdict in respect of the case brought against one accused should be the same as your verdict with respect to the case against one or more of the other accused. The evidence against each accused differs in a number of respects and the charges are different in respect of some charges and the same in respect of others, and you will need to pay careful attention to the evidence that the Crown relies on in support of the case it makes against each accused.

13   In considering the two charges, which are preferred against both accused, you should not seek to decide whether they are guilty. That would be quite wrong and unfair. You look at the case that is brought by the Crown against each man separately.

14   You will be required to return a separate verdict in respect of each accused and in respect of each charge.

15   In considering the case against each accused in respect of any count you must be careful to ensure that you do not allow the fact that he is accused of other offences to influence you against him. You must be scrupulous in considering the evidence in each case by itself. It would be quite wrong to reason towards his guilt of any offence because you thought ""he must be guilty if the police have charged him with so many offences"".

16   That goes particularly in this case where, as you know, each accused has pleaded guilty to some offences.”


	
	This direction, taken with the direction in relation to Bruce Gall not giving evidence, make it most unlikely that the jury acted in the way suggested by the ground of appeal. It should also be noted that in the course of the trial on a number of occasions the jury were clearly and accurately directed on the onus and burden of proof. These directions stressed that there was no onus on the accused but that it was for the Crown to prove his guilt.
	
	
	The assertion in submissions that Bruce Gall’s silence was “overwhelmingly and grossly prejudicial” and that as such required the direction now sought is not borne out by the conduct of the trial. There was nothing even faintly suggestive of the need for such a direction in the addresses of counsel, in the discussions between counsel and her Honour and in the questions received from the jury.
	
	
	I would grant leave to rely upon this ground of appeal but the ground has not been made out.
	


Ground 3 - In all the circumstances the murder verdict was unreasonable and cannot be supported having regard to the evidence.


	
	When this ground of appeal was raised with senior counsel for Kevin Gall, he made it clear that he was not relying upon this ground as a separate and freestanding ground. He advised that the ground depended for its success on the matters raised in support of Ground 1. It was for this reason that no submissions, either oral or written, were made in respect of any aspects of the evidence said to give rise to any of the verdicts against Kevin Gall being unreasonable.
	
	
	That being so, the failure of Kevin Gall to succeed on Ground 1 means that he must also fail on this ground.
	


THE APPEAL AGAINST SENTENCE BY KEVIN GALL

Sentence proceedings


	
	Kevin Gall was sentenced as follows:
	



	
	For the offence of pervert the course of justice – a fixed term of imprisonment for 1 year 10 months to date from 16 November 2010.
	
	
	For the offence of unauthorised possession of prohibited firearms and weapons – a term of imprisonment of 3 years 7 months with a non-parole period of 2 years and 8 months to date from 16 November 2011.
	
	
	For the offence of discharging a firearm with intent to cause grievous bodily harm – a fixed term of imprisonment of 8 years to date from 16 November 2013.
	
	
	For the murder – a sentence of 27 years with a non-parole period of 18 years to date from 16 November 2016.
	



	
	The overall effect of the sentence was a head sentence of 33 years with a non-parole period of 24 years to date from 16 November 2010. In the course of her sentencing judgment, her Honour noted that were she to set a separate sentence for murder she would have set a non-parole period of 20 years and that she only reduced same by reference to the overall non-parole period and the principle of totality.
	
	
	Her Honour reviewed the factual background to Kevin Gall’s offending in terms similar to those set out in this judgment. In relation to his subjective circumstances, her Honour found that he was born in 1978 and was aged 34 at the time of sentence (November 2012). In 1998 he had completed an apprenticeship and obtained a TAFE Certificate in Mechanical Engineering after completing a four year course. He had no significant prior criminal convictions and had not previously served a custodial sentence. He did not give evidence in the sentence proceedings.
	
	
	In relation to the murder offence her Honour found that Kevin Gall’s motive was a desire to rid himself of an unwanted adversary. Her Honour found that the jury verdict showed that it rejected the proposition that he had killed the deceased to defend or protect his father. She assessed the offence at the middle of the range of seriousness for an offence of murder.
	
	
	Her Honour took into account as an aggravating factor that Kevin Gall had disposed of the body of the deceased which was never found. She rejected his evidence that he did so because of fear of retribution by the Nomads and found that he did so to ensure that the body could not be examined.
	
	
	Her Honour accepted that the offence was planned in the sense that Kevin Gall chose to approach the Girraween premises unobtrusively so that his arrival would not be easily detected. She took into account that he used a pistol from a satchel in which he had carried it for months since the cessation of his friendship with the deceased. Her Honour noted that he had the pistol in his hand ready to fire as he approached the premises.
	
	
	Her Honour found as a mitigating factor that the offence had been provoked by the victim in that he had gone to the premises with Mr Fox demanding Kevin Gall’s presence. Her Honour also found that both Mr Fox and the deceased spoke to Bruce Gall in tones which were both aggressive and confrontational. Her Honour rejected the proposition that Kevin Gall was a person of good character and rejected the submission that he was genuinely remorseful.
	
	
	Her Honour found that Kevin Gall had good prospects of rehabilitation.
	
	
	Kevin Gall submitted to her Honour that his sentence should be reduced because of the degree to which the administration of justice had been facilitated by the conduct of his defence, i.e. by disclosures and admissions made pre-trial and during the trial. This meant that the trial had been significantly shortened. Her Honour accepted that his case had been properly and efficiently run which meant that many witnesses did not need to be called. Her Honour also accepted that in his evidence Kevin Gall had made admissions, particularly as to post offence conduct. Her Honour was not prepared to accept that he had made a genuine attempt to locate the deceased’s body. In the circumstances of the case, her Honour was not disposed to reduce his sentence by reason of those matters.
	


The Appeal

Ground 1 – The sentence imposed upon the murder was manifestly excessive and further in this regard her Honour erred in finding:

(a)   That the death of the deceased was brought about by Kevin Gall’s desire to rid himself of an unwanted adversary.

(b)   That the offence fell into the middle level of seriousness.

(c)   That there was no mitigation by virtue of it being unlikely the applicant was going to re-offend pursuant to s21A(3)(g) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 and/or;

(d)   There should be no discount for the facilitation of the administration of justice by the applicant’s admissions and the significant shortening of the trial.


	
	Kevin Gall submitted that her Honour’s finding as to his motivation to commit the offence of murder was inconsistent with her finding that there was a significant level of provocation involved in the offence. He submitted that in all the circumstances of the case, her Honour could not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he had an intention to kill the deceased rather than to inflict grievous bodily harm. He submitted that this placed the case at a lower level of seriousness than those where there was an intention to kill. He submitted that it was for this reason that her Honour erred in assessing the offence at the middle level of seriousness.
	
	
	He submitted that this was supported by the jury’s verdict on count 4 – i.e. that he discharged the firearm with intent to cause grievous bodily harm to Michael Fox, not with intent to murder him.
	
	
	Kevin Gall submitted that her Honour had erred in not specifically taking into account, when sentencing for the murder offence, that he was unlikely to re-offend whereas she had taken that into account in relation to the other offences. He referred to the particular circumstances of this offending and to the absence of any other criminal conduct on his record.
	
	
	Kevin Gall submitted that his admissions had significantly shortened the trial and that he should have received some benefit in sentencing because of this.
	


Consideration


	
	Her Honour’s finding as to Kevin Gall’s intention when he shot at the deceased was open to her. The finding was consistent with him alighting from the taxi before arriving at the Girraween premises, drawing the pistol and firing without warning and firing at least 3 shots at the deceased. The fact that there was an element of provocation on the part of the deceased and Mr Fox by being at the premises, is not inconsistent with that finding. Their presence merely brought matters to a head.
	
	
	Her Honour was well aware that in making that finding she had to do so beyond reasonable doubt (sentence judgment at [5]). There was sufficient evidence to allow her Honour to make her finding to that standard. The position of Mr Fox was different to that of the deceased. The deceased was the person who was pressing Kevin Gall to return property and to do other things, whereas Mr Fox occupied a supporting role.
	
	
	In order to set aside a factual finding by a sentencing judge, it is necessary to establish that there was an error of principle or a mistake of fact or law so as to indicate that the sentencing discretion miscarried (House v R [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499 at 505). Kevin Gall has not identified error of that kind.
	
	
	Kevin Gall’s challenge to her Honour’s assessment of the objective seriousness of the offending was largely dependent on him being successful in challenging her factual finding as to his intent when he shot the deceased. Since he has failed on that issue, this challenge largely falls away.
	
	
	As this Court has said on many occasions, the objective seriousness of an offence is a matter of evaluative judgment about which reasonable minds can differ. Spigelman CJ said in Mulato v Regina [2006] NSWCCA 282 at [37]:
	


“37    Characterisation of the degree of objective seriousness of an offence is classically within the role of the sentencing judge in performing the task of finding facts and drawing inferences from those facts. This Court is very slow to determine such matters for itself or to set aside the judgment made by a first instance judge exercising a broadly based discretion. The question must be whether or not the particular characterisation which her Honour gave to the circumstances of the offence was open to her Honour. …”


	
	In Mulato Simpson J said at [46]:
	


“46   … The importance of respecting the role of a first instance judge should never be underestimated. It is not the function of this Court to substitute its own view of objective seriousness for that of the first instance judge. That is not because objective seriousness is something determined by reference to the evaluation of the credibility of witnesses, in respect of which it is conventionally held that the first instance judge is in a superior position. It is because it is a fundamental aspect of the appellate system. Each judicial officer in the hierarchy has his or her own function, and those at appellate level need to take care not to trespass upon the role of those at first instance.”


	
	Those passages have repeatedly been endorsed (R v Lolesio [2014] NSWCCA 219 at [63] – [64]; Kaminic v R [2014] NSWCCA 116 at [46] – [47] and McGeown v R [2014] NSWCCA 314 at [9] – [11].) That approach was most recently confirmed in Sabongi v R [2015] NSWCCA 25 at [65] – [69].
	
	
	While her Honour did not say in terms that she took into account the unlikelihood of Kevin Gall re-offending as a mitigating factor, it is clear that she did so. She referred to that matter three times in her sentence judgment. In that regard, it should be noted that although her Honour did not find that the applicant was a person of good character, she still took into account in his favour that he had good prospects of rehabilitation. That finding is closely aligned with a finding that he was unlikely to re-offend.
	
	
	Kevin Gall admitted his involvement in the shooting at an early point in time. There is no doubt that counsel appearing for him conducted his case properly and efficiently. On the former issue, however, eye witness and other evidence would have made a denial of an involvement in the shooting counter-productive. By admitting his involvement, Kevin Gall was able to direct his evidence to exculpating factors.
	
	
	Although his case was run expeditiously and his legal advisors are to be congratulated in that regard, it does not automatically follow that there should be a discount of sentence. This is very much a matter for the sentencing judge particularly when the judge had already had regard to totality and was required to impose a sentence which, in all the circumstances, was commensurate with the offending.
	
	
	This ground of appeal has not been made out.
	


Ground 2 -    The sentence imposed upon the discharge firearm with intent to cause grievous bodily harm was manifestly excessive and further in this regard, her Honour erred in finding:

(a)   There was no element of provocation to be taken into account pursuant to s21A(3)(c) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 and/or

(b)   There should be no discount for the facilitation of the administration of justice by the applicant’s admissions and the significant shortening of the trial.


	
	Kevin Gall submitted that her Honour, having found a level of provocation in that the deceased and Mr Fox went to the premises to stand over him and his father, should have reduced the sentence for this offence in order to take that matter into account.
	
	
	Kevin Gall relied upon the earlier submissions relating to the facilitation of justice in relation to the sentence for this offence.
	


Consideration


	
	Her Honour specifically rejected any element of provocation in relation to this offence when she said:
	


“I do not accept that Kevin Gall was provoked by the victim. At the relevant time Mr Fox who knew that the deceased would already have died from the several gunshot wounds that he had received, was simply trying to escape so that he too would not be shot.” (Sentence judgment at [84])


	
	This finding was open to her Honour. All the evidence was to the effect that Mr Fox was trying to escape when Kevin Gall fired at him. The provocation which her Honour found in relation to the murder offence had already ceased by the time this offence was committed, i.e. having seen the deceased shot, Mr Fox was fleeing for his life.
	
	
	In relation to the second part of this ground of appeal, the matters raised in pars [126] – [127] apply and it was open to her Honour to take the approach which she did.
	
	
	This ground of appeal has not been made out.
	


Ground 3 – Her Honour erred in accumulating the murder sentence by 3 years with respect to the discharge of the firearm with intent to cause grievous bodily harm sentence.


	
	Kevin Gall submitted that although the question of accumulation was a discretionary matter, when one took into account the extent of the accumulation on the firearms offences, as well as that relating to the discharge firearm with intent offence, it was clear that the extent of the accumulation was excessive in that the sentence for the murder offence did not commence for 6 years after the sentence for pervert the course of justice.
	


Consideration


	
	As was appreciated by Kevin Gall, the question of accumulation and concurrency is a discretionary one. Howie J set out the relevant principles in Cahyadi v Regina [2007] NSWCCA 1; 168 A Crim R 41 . One of the issues to be considered by a sentencing judge is the extent to which one offence can be said to subsume another or other offences. While these offences were part of a course of conduct, they were nevertheless quite separate. Having killed the deceased, Kevin Gall chased Mr Fox shooting at him with an intent to inflict grievous bodily harm. The quite separate nature of this offence required a level of accumulation. The extent of that accumulation was a matter entirely within her Honour’s discretion (House v R). Kevin Gall has failed to show how that exercise of discretion miscarried.
	
	
	This ground of appeal has not been made out.
	


Ground 4 – The sentence imposed with respect to the pervert the course of justice charge is manifestly excessive and her Honour has erred in:

(a)   Finding the offence was committed in company.

(b)   Failing to find that the damage caused by the offence was not substantial and/or

(c)   Failing to be satisfied that the offence was not part of an organised criminal activity.


	
	This ground of appeal relates to the occasion, approximately two months after the murder, when Kevin Gall, Bruce Gall, Mr Van Straalen and Mr Lapich were talking and a transcript of what they said became Exhibit AC. It is apparent from that exhibit that Kevin and Bruce Gall encouraged Mr Lapich to give false evidence and that Kevin Gall encouraged Mr Lapich to destroy his mobile phone.
	
	
	The relevant findings by her Honour, which are challenged by this ground of appeal were that the offence was committed in company and the rejection of the two matters put forward by Kevin Gall as mitigating considerations – that the damage caused by the offence was not substantial and that the offence was not part of a planned or organised criminal activity. Her Honour declined to make findings in accordance with those submissions. This was because there was insufficient evidence before her to allow her to ascertain how long the arrest of Kevin Gall had been delayed by that conduct and there was insufficient evidence to allow her to make a positive finding that the advice given to Mr Lapich was not part of a planned or organised criminal activity.
	
	
	Kevin Gall submitted that despite the fact that Bruce Gall was present at the time the advice was provided to Mr Lapich, there was no evidence that his presence precipitated or had any role in causing that advice to be given. He submitted that there was no evidence that the advice given to Mr Lapich had any material effect upon his subsequent arrest. He submitted that there was no evidence that he had discussed the giving of this advice with any other person including Bruce Gall. In those circumstances, he submitted, her Honour should have made the findings which were requested.
	


Consideration


	
	The fact that the conversation with Mr Lapich occurred more than two months after the murder allowed the inference that Kevin and Bruce Gall had plenty of time to think about the circumstances of the murder and “the various ways in which the investigation of the killing could be thwarted with a view to Kevin Gall’s culpability never being discovered by the police”. The state of the evidence was such that it was open to her Honour not to be satisfied as to the two mitigating matters referred to. By way of contrast, the part played by Kevin and Bruce Gall in what was discussed at the time that Exhibit AC came into existence, meant it was open to her Honour to find that this offence was committed by Kevin Gall in company with Bruce Gall. Bruce Gall made remarks which encouraged Mr Lapich to give false evidence at a time when Kevin Gall was trying to achieve the same result.
	
	
	This ground of appeal has not been made out.
	


Ground 5 – The sentences imposed with respect to the firearms offences were excessive and her Honour erred in setting a non-parole period in the circumstances of pleas of guilty in excess of the standard non-parole period.


	
	This ground of appeal was not relied upon.
	


Ground 6 – Her Honour erred by accumulating the sentence for discharge of a firearm with intent to cause grievous bodily harm by 2 years with respect to the firearms offences.


	
	Kevin Gall relied upon the same submissions as were made in respect of ground 3.
	


Consideration


	
	The same principles apply to this ground of appeal as apply to ground 3 and Kevin Gall has the same difficulties in making out this ground. Since he has failed to show how her Honour’s sentencing discretion miscarried on this issue, this ground of appeal should be dismissed.
	


Conclusion as to Kevin Gall


	
	The orders which I propose in relation to the conviction appeal and the application for leave to appeal against sentence are as follows:
	


(1)   In relation to the conviction appeal, I would grant leave to appeal in respect of grounds 1, 2 and 3 but would dismiss the appeal.


	
	(2)   In relation to the application for leave to appeal against sentence, I would grant leave to appeal but dismiss the appeal.
	


BRUCE GALL – CONVICTION APPEAL

Ground 1 – Her Honour erred in her directions to the jury about the requirements to be satisfied before the appellant could be convicted of the offence of being an accessory after the fact to the murder of Mr Green.


	
	Her Honour gave directions to the jury on this issue in writing and orally. The content of the directions was agreed to by all counsel. The written directions were:
	


“ACCESSORY AFTER THE FACT TO MURDER (BRUCE GALL)

The Crown alleged that Bruce Gall is an accessory after the fact to murder. The act that the Crown relies upon is the allegation that Bruce Gall washed blood from the concrete at 8 Wiltona Place, Girraween on 16 April 2010.

Bruce Gall is an accessory after the fact to murder if he assisted Kevin Gall in any way or hinders the apprehension, trial or punishment of Kevin Gall knowing when he did so that Kevin Gall had committed the crime of murder.

Thus the Crown must satisfy you beyond reasonable doubt of these matters:

(i)   That the crime of murder was committed by Kevin Gall and

(ii)   That at the time Bruce Gall rendered assistance, Bruce Gall was aware of all the essential facts or acts that established the crime of murder by Kevin Gall and

(iii)   That Bruce Gall with that knowledge had intentionally assisted Kevin Gall by washing the blood from the concrete.

(iv)   That Bruce Gall washed the blood from the concrete on 16 April 2010.

ALTERNATIVE VERDICT – ACCESSORY AFTER THE FACT TO MANSLAUGHTER (BRUCE GALL)

This matter only arises for consideration in the event that you decide to return a verdict of “not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter” with respect to Kevin Gall.

In this event, you would necessarily not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Bruce Gall is guilty as an accessory after murder because you are not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the crime of murder has been committed.

It would follow that you would return a verdict of not guilty with respect to the count of accessory after murder against Bruce Gall.

You would consider in the alternative whether you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Bruce Gall is an accessory after manslaughter.

In order to return a verdict of guilty with respect to this alternative count, the Crown must satisfy you beyond reasonable doubt that:

(i)   That the crime of manslaughter was committed by Kevin Gall and

(ii)   That at the time Bruce Gall rendered assistance, Bruce Gall was aware of all the essential facts or acts that establish the crime of manslaughter by Kevin Gall and

(iii)   That Bruce Gall with that knowledge had intentionally assisted Kevin Gall by washing the blood from the concrete.

(iv)   That Bruce Gall washed the blood from the concrete on 16 April 2010.


	
	The oral directions were as follows:
	


“BRUCE GALL: accessory after the fact to murder

286   This question arises only if you are satisfied that Kevin Gall is guilty of murder or manslaughter of Neil Green.

287   In order to prove that Bruce Gall is an accessory after the fact to the murder (or manslaughter, as the case may be) of Neil Green, the Crown must prove that Bruce Gall has assisted Kevin Gall, in any way, or aided him in disposing of the proceeds of the crime, or hinders the apprehension, trial or punishment of Kevin Gall knowing when he did so that Kevin Gall had committed the crime.

288   In this case that is all limited, as counsel had told you, to the act of hosing down the carport. It is not about any of the other things that Mr Bruce Gall might have done. It is just the hosing down of the carport. Thus the Crown must satisfy you of these matters —

(1)   That the crime of murder or manslaughter was committed.

(2)   That at the time Bruce Gall rendered assistance, he was aware of all the essential facts or acts that establish the unlawful homicide to which the Crown alleges that Bruce Gall was an accessory.

(3)   That Bruce Gall, with that knowledge, had intentionally harboured or assisted Kevin Gall by hosing down the carport area where the deceased was shot to remove his blood.

(4)   That Bruce Gall, in hosing down the carport area, acted with the intention of assisting Kevin Gall to escape arrest or conviction.”


	
	By way of further background, at the close of his case Bruce Gall submitted that it was not open to her Honour to leave to the jury the alternative verdict of accessory after the fact to manslaughter. By judgment entitled R v Kevin Gall; R v Bruce Gall [No 4] [2012] NSWSC 1355 her Honour rejected that submission. In the course of doing so, her Honour said:
	


“19   The jury's right to return an alternative verdict in such circumstances, gives rise to a correlative duty imposed on the trial judge to instruct a jury upon possible facts leading to an available outcome in addition to a count specifically charged: Pemble v The Queen [1971] HCA 20; 124 CLR 107. Just as manslaughter is a lesser offence to murder, the charge of accessory after the fact to manslaughter is a lesser offence to the charge of accessory after the fact to murder. So much is reflected in the different penalties for such offences (five years as opposed to 25 years).

20   In my view, while the principle is of general application to all indictable offences, the position is a fortiori in the case of murder and manslaughter where historical concepts relating to the single crime of unlawful homicide apply (see R v Elfar [2000] NSWCCA 255; 115 A Crim R 64, per Sperling J).

21   The difference between murder and manslaughter is pre-eminently in the mind of the accused person. This has been found to have an effect on the mental element required to be established on a charge of accessory after the fact to murder or manslaughter.

22   The matter was considered in R v Stone [1981] VR 737. At the end of the Crown case, the accused submitted that there was no case to answer on counts which included being an accessory after the fact to murder. The accused submitted that it was necessary for the Crown to prove knowledge by the accused at the relevant time of facts or acts which would allow it to be said that the crime of which the principal was guilty had in fact been committed to the knowledge of the accused at the time at which he was alleged to be acting as accessory.

23   Crockett J said, of the charge of accessory after the fact to murder:

""The acts, or facts, which must be shown to have been within the knowledge of the accessory at the relevant time do not have to include matters that would prevent what otherwise would be murder from being murder or which would make the offence an offence less than murder. That is to say, it is sufficient if the acts, or facts, of which the accused is shown to have knowledge are such from which it could be said that he must have inferred that the principal had by a voluntary act shot and killed his wife and that he had done so with the intention either to kill or cause grievous bodily harm. The evidence adduced by the Crown, including particularly the matters to which I have already referred in outlining the evidence, would allow an inference of such a kind to be found to have been drawn by the accused, so that the knowledge that he had at the relevant time was that the principal had committed the felony of murder. Of course, as matters then existed, it may have been that the shot was fired in self- defence, so as to reduce the crime to manslaughter. It may have been that the shot was fired under the influence of provocation, so as to reduce the crime to manslaughter. I do not think that it has to be shown by the Crown that the accused had knowledge of the acts, or facts, which would have allowed him to have drawn the inference that the offence committed was in fact something less than murder. It may have turned out to be so, although in the present case we now know it did not, because Eddington was convicted of the murder of his wife. But even if it had turned out that the offence was not murder but the lesser offence of manslaughter, the fact that in this case the accused need not have been shown to have knowledge other than that a felonious homicide had been committed by the principal with the intent of killing or causing grievous bodily harm is borne out by the case referred to in Tevendale's Case, supra [[1955] VLR 95], R v Richards (1877) 2 QBD 311.""

Submissions by Bruce Gall


	
	The submissions on behalf of Bruce Gall were as follows.
	
	
	His liability was for the discrete offence of being an accessory after the fact to either murder or manslaughter. These are alternative offences. They are plainly different from one another. It was essential that the jury be instructed that they were separate alternative offences.
	
	
	Her Honour omitted to properly instruct the jury that before Bruce Gall could be found guilty of the subject offence, his knowledge must have been of the precise felony, namely murder, committed by Kevin Gall. It was not sufficient to simply refer to “the unlawful homicide” (R v Tevendale [1955] VLR 95; ALR 260; R v Stone [1981] VR 737).
	
	
	It was essential that the jury be instructed that before they could convict Bruce Gall, they had to be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that at the time he performed the alleged act of assistance, he knew that his son had committed the offence of murder. The jury had to be instructed that before they could convict, they needed to be satisfied that he was aware that his son had shot the deceased, either with the intent to kill him or cause him grievous bodily harm, or with reckless indifference to whether the deceased would be killed by the gunshot.
	
	
	The jury also had to be directed that they had to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that at the relevant time, Bruce Gall did not believe that his son had shot the deceased in his [Bruce Gall’s] defence and did not believe that his son’s conduct was a reasonable response in the circumstances as he [Kevin Gall] perceived them to be. It was essential that the jury’s attention be focused upon what crime, if any, Bruce Gall understood had been committed at the time of his assistance.
	
	
	The directions of her Honour failed to do this. The directions ignored the mental state of Bruce Gall at the time he was said to have hosed down the carport. Even though trial counsel for Bruce Gall did not seek a re-direction, the error was a fundamental one and touched upon the elements of the offence. The error occasioned a miscarriage of justice and for this reason, leave should be granted pursuant to r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules.
	
	
	The error in her Honour’s written direction in relation to the alternative verdict of accessory after the fact to manslaughter was that such an alternative verdict would only arise in the event that the jury returned a verdict of not guilty of murder, but guilty of manslaughter with respect to Kevin Gall. That was incorrect. The jury should have been told that even if they found Kevin Gall guilty of the murder of the deceased, they could still return a verdict of guilty of being an accessory after the fact to manslaughter of the deceased against Bruce Gall. R v Nguyen [2010] HCA 38; 242 CLR 491 at [44] – [46], [49] – [50] and Nguyen v R [2013] HCA 32; 298 ALR 649 at [23] – [27] were said to be authority for that proposition.
	
	
	Such an alternative verdict continued to be available because it remained open that Bruce Gall was not aware of all of the essential facts necessary for murder and might have believed that Kevin Gall had committed manslaughter. For example, he may have considered that Kevin Gall had killed the deceased by way of excessive self-defence, provocation or an unlawful and dangerous act.
	
	
	The written directions made it impossible for the jury to consider the alternative verdict of being an accessory after the fact to manslaughter if a verdict of guilty of murder was to be returned against Kevin Gall. Such a verdict was returned and accordingly, the jury never got to consider the alternative verdict in Bruce Gall’s case. It was submitted that a similar issue arose in Budrodeen v R [2014] NSWCCA 332.
	
	
	The Crown did not join issue with the submissions put on behalf of Bruce Gall other than to rely upon R v Stone. It was the Crown’s submission that R v Stone provided a complete answer to the submission and should be followed by this Court.
	


Consideration


	
	I have concluded that Bruce Gall’s submissions should be accepted. As a matter of logic, they conform with the approach which the courts have consistently adopted for murder and manslaughter. The principle was succinctly stated by Cockburn CJ in The Queen v Richards (1877) 2 QBD 311 at 313:
	


“As to the main point, a man charged with murder may be convicted of manslaughter because murder involves the lesser charge of felonious homicide; so, for the same reason, one charged as accessory to murder may be convicted as accessory to manslaughter. The one thing follows from the other.”


	
	To the extent that there is any authority on the issue, it supports the submission of Bruce Gall. A surprising feature of this ground of appeal is the paucity of authority.
	
	
	In R v Tevendale Herring CJ said:
	


“The next question that was raised was a question as to what knowledge the person charged with being an accessory must have and the case was dealt with by the learned judge at the trial on the basis that the accessory must know that the principal offence has been committed – must know of the acts of the principal felon. … My present view, for what it is worth, is that the matter has been properly dealt with in this case and that it is necessary before a man can be convicted of being an accessory after the fact that the jury be satisfied that he did know the principal offence had been committed by the principal felon; that if charged with assisting a thief it is necessary that he should know that the theft has been committed.”


	
	Martin J was not so definite and said:
	


“So far as this presentment is concerned, I am satisfied that it was necessary for the Crown to show that Tevendale had knowledge of the actual felony charged, but I am not at all sure that that would be necessary in all cases. …”


	
	Sholl J went into the matter in most detail and said:
	


“The learned Judge at the trial directed the jury that it was necessary for the Crown to prove knowledge in the accused of the precise felony to which he was alleged to have become accessory, and the accused cannot complain of that direction, nor does his counsel in fact complain of it here. … It is not perhaps strictly necessary in this particular case to decide whether any wider definition of the crime of being an accessory after the fact than that given by the learned trial judge would be correct in law, but since the matter has been so fully argued and the question is one of the practical importance to the administration of the criminal law, it is in my opinion desirable to say something about it. My present opinion is that the definition given by the learned judge is the correct definition and that it is not sufficient to constitute the offence to prove knowledge in or notice to the accused that the person harboured or assisted was guilty of some felony, of the precise nature of which he did not have knowledge or notice. …

So I with great respect differ from my brother Martin's opinion that there - may

be cases where a wider definition might be put before a jury. Otherwise it seems to me that, to give one example, as I gave during the argument, a man who had committed a murder might tell another person he had committed larceny - each crime being a felony and if the person whom he so approached then assisted him to escape justice, it would follow that the assister would be guilty of being accessory after the fact to the murder, the felony in fact committed. It seems to me that that cannot well be the law; though, no doubt, knowledge of all the relevant facts might perhaps be sufficient. Of course, it might be said that the crimes in the example just given could be reversed and so a man might escape punishment for this particular offence of being an accessory after the fact even though he in fact assisted a thief in the belief that the thief had been guilty of murder. But inconveniences like that, I think, if the circumstances do not disclose some other offence at common law, ought to be a matter for remedial legislation. …”


	
	Comments to similar effect were made by Hasluck and Roberts-Smith JJ in Winning v The Queen [2003] WASCA 245. The difficulty with Winning is that the criminal law in Western Australia has been codified and it may be that, in part, this qualifies the reliance which can be placed on these observations.
	
	
	Hasluck J said:
	


“121   It is commonly accepted that for the liability of an accessory after the fact to arise, it is necessary for the Crown to establish the commission of the principal offence. However, it is not necessary that the principal offender be convicted or be amenable to justice. The requirement is that the offence must have been committed. Moreover, the accessory must have knowledge that the person assisted has committed the offence. The relevant time for assessing the state of mind of the accessory will be at the time the alleged assistance was given.

122    In R v Stone [1981] VR 737 Crockett J observed at 740 that what must be proved by way of knowledge on the part of the accessory is knowledge of all the relevant facts, or acts, that establish the precise felony with respect to which the Crown alleges the accused was an accessory.

…

127    Reasoning of this kind appears to affirm the basic rule that a person cannot be convicted as a secondary party unless he knows the essential circumstances constituting the offence: Wilson v Dobra (1955) 57 WALR 95. Further, just as a man charged with murder may be convicted of manslaughter, because murder involves the lesser charge of felonious homicide; so, for the same reason, one charged as accessory to murder may be convicted as accessory to manslaughter: R v Richards (1877) 2 QBD 311 at 313.

…

143    Having regard to the reasoning in Carter & Savage (R v Carter and Savage Ex Parte Attorney General [1990] 2 Qd R 371), I conclude that it was open to the learned trial Judge to admit evidence to the effect that Avis had been convicted of wilful murder. However, evidence of that kind was not conclusive. The applicant was entitled to assert that the principal offender, Avis, committed the lesser offences of murder or manslaughter in which case the applicant would have been an accessory after the fact to an offence other than wilful murder. It is true that the applicant's admissions were potent evidence that he had knowledge of facts which might be sufficient for him to be convicted of being an accessory after the fact to wilful murder. However, in my view, as the learned trial Judge was obliged to give directions as to the alternative verdicts of murder and manslaughter, he was also obliged to inform the jury that the applicant could be convicted as an accessory after the fact to either of those lesser offences.

144    It follows that, in my view, the learned trial Judge erred in proceeding from the premise that because Avis had previously been convicted of wilful murder the applicant could only be an accessory after the fact to that offence. This meant that he erred in declining to direct the jury that it was open to find the applicant guilty of being an accessory after the fact to an unlawful killing other than wilful murder.

145    Put shortly, if, in the course of considering alternative verdicts, the jury reached a point where they had to resolve the accessory issue, because they were satisfied that Avis, acting alone, struck the fatal blows, it was open to the jury to find that the applicant knew only of acts done by Avis amounting to murder or manslaughter, in which case the applicant could only be convicted of being an accessory after the fact to the offence of which he had knowledge.

146    The notion that a secondary party's knowledge will be a limiting factor in determining the extent of his criminal responsibility as an accessory after the fact can be illustrated by an example. If the secondary party assists in the removal of a body from the road, having been told that the death resulted from an accident, it would be hard to accept that he was an accessory after the fact to wilful murder, even if it subsequently emerged that, unbeknownst to the secondary party, the running down was deliberate and the principal was convicted of wilful murder. It follows, then, on the applicant's case, that if the applicant did not know what Avis intended to do or exactly what he did with the knife, it was open to the jury to find the applicant guilty of being an accessory after the fact to an unlawful killing other than wilful murder, and they should have been directed accordingly.”


	
	Roberts-Smith J made observations to similar effect:
	


“237    As the ground was argued, and from the trial transcript, however, it is clear that what was sought to be put was that if the jury found the applicant not guilty of wilful murder, murder or manslaughter, but that he had knowingly assisted Avis after the killing, it was open to them to find him guilty of being an accessory after the fact to wilful murder, murder or manslaughter.

…

240    The learned trial Judge was of the view that the applicant would be guilty as an accessory after the fact to whatever offence occurred in law; that is, unlike liability as an aider where one can aid only to the extent of one's knowledge of the commission of the offence, an accessory who knowingly afterwards does acts which aid the offender, whatever the actual offence was, is guilty of being an accessory after the fact to that offence. He referred to the following passage in the joint judgment of Lowe and Smith JJ in R v Dawson [1961] VR 773:

""... for it is a rule long established that upon the trial of a person on a charge of having been an accessory to the commission of a felony, proof of the conviction of the alleged principal offender is admissible, and constitutes prima facie evidence that the felony was committed by him.""

241    In short, his Honour said that in his view the law is that once the principal offender had been convicted of wilful murder, then anyone afterwards assisting and becoming an accessory after the fact, could only be an accessory to wilful murder and no other offence. He rejected senior counsel's submission that notwithstanding Avis' conviction, it was open for the jury to bring in a verdict that the applicant was guilty as accessory to murder or manslaughter.

…

247    The submission by senior counsel for the applicant that the phrase ""that offence"" is properly to be construed as encompassing all alternative verdicts open on the indictment, must be accepted.

248   This ground must be upheld.”

To the extent that R v Stone says the contrary, it should not be followed.


	
	It follows that this ground of appeal has been made out. That, however, does not end the matter. The issue of the proviso arises. Section 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 provides:
	


“6(1)    The court on any appeal under section 5(1) against conviction shall allow the appeal if it is of opinion that the verdict of the jury should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable, or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence, or that the judgment of the court of trial should be set aside on the ground of the wrong decision of any question of law, or that on any other ground whatsoever there was a miscarriage of justice, and in any other case shall dismiss the appeal; provided that the court may, notwithstanding that it is of opinion that the point or points raised by the appeal might be decided in favour of the appellant, dismiss the appeal if it considers that no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred.”


	
	The proviso has been applied even though a trial judge did not properly direct the jury on an element of the offence charged (R v Gulliford [2004] NSWCCA 338; 148 A Crim R 558, Festa v R [2001] HCA 72; 208 CLR 593). The issue on the proviso is whether Bruce Gall lost a real chance of being convicted of the lesser offence of being an accessory after the fact to manslaughter because of her Honour’s erroneous direction on that issue.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the evidence was such that the only rational inference open on the evidence was that Bruce Gall knew all of the facts which gave rise to the conviction of Kevin Gall for the offence of murder so that even if the jury had been properly directed, they could not rationally have come to any other conclusion but that Bruce Gall was an accessory after the fact to the murder of the deceased.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the jury had clearly rejected Kevin Gall’s evidence to the effect that he shot the deceased in order to protect his father and himself. The Crown submitted that it followed from that rejection that the jury had also rejected his evidence that Bruce Gall said to him, immediately before he shot the deceased, that the deceased had a gun. The Crown submitted that even without relying upon the evidence of Mr Fox (which the jury may not have wholly accepted) it would have been clear to Bruce Gall, after the shooting but before the hosing down of the car port, that neither the deceased nor Mr Fox had a gun. An inspection of the deceased would have made that clear and the compelling inference from the flight of Mr Fox without attempting to retaliate, was that he was not armed.
	
	
	The Crown also relied upon the following extract from p 20 of Exhibit AC:
	


“BG   Yeah they had f’ing bats in the car. They had motor cycle helmets … pull them over your head.

PV   They didn’t have any guns or anything though, hey?

BG   No.

PV   No?

BG   They were looking for mine.

PV   They were looking for your guns?

BG   They were searching. You know when they were searching. That c… was looking in the back. That’s what he was looking for. He looked through the house. He said “I’m gunna look through your house”. …”


	
	That part of the transcript of Exhibit AC (if accurate) provided very strong evidence that at no time did Bruce Gall believe that either the deceased or Mr Fox had guns before the deceased was shot.
	
	
	In a supplementary written submission following the conclusion of oral submissions in the appeal, it was asserted on behalf of Kevin Gall (but not on behalf of Bruce Gall) that this part of the transcript was incorrectly transcribed. It was submitted that it was not clear that Bruce Gall said “no” or whether it was only Van Straalen that said “no” and that thereafter Bruce Gall said “yeah he had it on him” which has not been recorded in the transcript.
	
	
	This point was not taken by either applicant at trial and has not been taken by Bruce Gall in the appeal. At trial the transcript of Exhibit AC was accepted as an accurate transcription of what the listening device was able to pick up and was tendered without objection (T.291.40). The submission is contrary to the evidence of Kevin Gall on this very point (T.467.4). A challenge to the accuracy and completeness of the transcript should not be allowed to be taken for the first time in the appeal. In any event, the issue was not raised in Bruce Gall’s appeal and I propose to disregard it.
	
	
	The Crown submission should be accepted. The evidence was such that the only rational inference open was that Bruce Gall knew all the relevant facts relating to the shooting of the deceased and that there was no basis for a belief on his part that his son was trying to defend either him or himself.
	
	
	The Crown position is even stronger when the evidence of Mr Fox is taken into account. Although the jury may not have accepted all of his evidence, they must have accepted most of it for them to reach the verdict which they did in relation to Kevin Gall.
	
	
	It needs to be remembered that it is the state of knowledge of Bruce Gall which is relevant. He was in the presence of the deceased and Mr Fox for the whole of the time. Even before the death of the deceased and the flight of Mr Fox he was likely to have been well aware that they were not carrying guns. If they had been armed with guns, the compelling inference is that he would have been threatened with them. In that respect, the evidence of Mr Fox was almost certainly correct when he surmised that when Bruce Gall started to run he was not “fleeing” from the deceased but was going to either lock himself in the office or get a gun. It is also relevant that the layout and photographs of the premises make it clear that when Kevin Gall shot the deceased, Bruce Gall was running directly towards him.
	
	
	The issue can be looked at in another way. The only evidence to the contrary depended upon an acceptance of Kevin Gall’s explanation for why he shot the deceased which was clearly rejected by the jury. There is no other evidence which would provide a rational basis for a belief on the part of Bruce Gall that his son was trying to defend him or himself. Not surprisingly, given the state of the evidence, no submission was made at trial that Bruce Gall may have thought that his son was trying to defend him.
	
	
	This is a case in which the proviso to s6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 should be applied in that Bruce Gall did not lose a real chance of an acquittal on the more serious accessory charge. This ground of appeal has not been made out.
	


THE APPEAL AGAINST SENTENCE BY BRUCE GALL

Sentence proceedings


	
	Bruce Gall was sentenced as follows:
	



	
	For the offence of being an accessory after the fact to murder, a fixed term of imprisonment of 2 years to date from 16 January 2012. The maximum penalty for this offence is imprisonment for 25 years.
	
	
	For the offence of perverting the course of justice, a fixed term of imprisonment of 16 months to date from 16 September 2013. The maximum penalty for this offence is imprisonment for 14 years.
	
	
	For the offence of possessing prohibited weapons, imprisonment with a non-parole period of 18 months to date from 16 January 2015 with a balance of term of 18 months to expire 13 January 2018. The maximum penalty for this offence is imprisonment for 14 years with a standard non-parole period of 3 years.
	



	
	The total effective sentence was imprisonment for 6 years with a non-parole period of 4 years and 6 months. Bruce Gall is eligible for release to parole on 15 July 2016.
	
	
	In accordance with the jury verdict, her Honour found that on 16 April 2010 Bruce Gall assisted his son to escape detection by hosing away the deceased’s blood from the concrete floor of the premises with a high pressure hose.
	
	
	When reviewing the facts in her sentence judgment, her Honour noted that in the intercepted conversation of 19 June 2010 (exhibit AC) Kevin Gall sought to influence Mr Lapich to give a false account to police about his whereabouts on 16 April 2010 and to destroy his mobile phone so that the text messages he had sent to Kevin Gall on that day would never be recovered. In accordance with his plea of guilty, her Honour noted that on that occasion Bruce Gall had also encouraged Mr Lapich to give a false version of his whereabouts on that day.
	
	
	Again in accordance with his plea of guilty, her Honour found that on 16 November 2010 a further search warrant was executed at the Wiltona Place premises and that in the process of executing the search warrant, Bruce Gall escorted police into the office where in response to questioning he indicated the whereabouts of a six round .38 calibre revolver. The revolver was wrapped in a light brown cloth on top of the table in the middle of the office. Police seized the revolver and found it to be loaded with six .38 calibre rounds.
	
	
	On 16 November 2010 Bruce Gall was arrested and charged but was released on conditional bail on 22 September 2011, having spent the intervening period in custody. Her Honour in structuring his sentences took into account time already served.
	
	
	Bruce Gall did not give evidence at the trial nor at the sentence hearing. Her Honour based her findings of fact as to his subjective circumstances on a pre-sentence report dated 26 October 2012. Bruce Gall relied upon a report of a psychologist, Bradley Jones, dated 1 October 2012. Her Honour was not prepared to accept the history recorded by Mr Jones because it was not otherwise verified and as a result, the opinions expressed by him were without foundation.
	
	
	Her Honour found that Bruce Gall was born in 1951 and was the younger of two siblings. His mother abused alcohol and was violent, leaving the family home when he was about 12. He had little further contact with her. His father remarried but he was rejected by his stepmother and left the family home when aged about 17. He left school at 15 and commenced an apprenticeship as a fitter and turner. He worked with his father who owned an engineering company and eventually ran his own business.
	
	
	Bruce Gall married in 1970 and had two sons, one of whom was Kevin Gall. Although he and his wife separated in 1999 and divorced in 2000, they remained on good terms. At the time of sentencing he resided with his former wife who continued to provide him with support and friendship. He had a prior criminal record but because the most recent offence was in 1990, her Honour regarded that as being of little moment.
	
	
	Her Honour made the following findings in relation to the offences. Bruce Gall’s act of hosing down the car port was the only act relied upon by the Crown in relation to the offence of accessory after the fact. She found that its effect was to assist his son to escape detection, at least for a period, since had the blood remained in place it would probably have led the neighbours or other visitors to report it to the police. Her Honour was prepared to accept that although not excusable, this offence was an understandable act by a father who was devoted to and concerned about his son whom he knew to have just killed someone. Her Honour was prepared to accept that this was an instinctive act by a loyal father in the “heat of the moment”.
	
	
	Her Honour found that the factors motivating Bruce Gall were emotional attachment and a misguided sense of loyalty.
	
	
	Nevertheless, her Honour noted that the offence was a serious one, as indicated by the maximum penalty. Her Honour noted that there were strong policy reasons for regarding the offence as a serious one and quoted from Thomas JA in R v Hawken (1986) 27 A Crim R 32 at 38:
	


“""...it is in the interests of the community that murderers should be completely isolated from support and deprived of assistance and that such crimes are not covered up.""


	
	Her Honour took into account as an aggravating factor that the offence was committed in company (s21A(2)(e) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999). By way of mitigating factors, her Honour took into account that the acts of Bruce Gall in hosing down the car port did not, to the extent that he was responding in a relatively short period of time to an event that was both violent and as far as he was concerned unexpected, form part of a planned or organised criminal activity (s21A(3)(b) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999).
	
	
	In relation to the offence of perverting the course of justice, her Honour assessed the underlying facts as being in a different category to those associated with the accessory after the fact to murder offence. Whereas the hosing of blood from the car port might be understood as an impulsive emotional act borne of paternal devotion, the act of encouraging Mr Lapich to give false evidence could not be viewed in the same way.
	
	
	Her Honour considered that the state of Bruce Gall’s knowledge at the time of that conversation was relevantly the same as that of Kevin Gall, i.e. it was a serious matter to encourage a potential witness to give a false account if questioned by police with a view to concealing a homicide. The events had occurred some two months after the murder and so could not be regarded as having been in the “heat of the moment”. He would also have been aware of the other acts of Kevin Gall to mislead the police, i.e. the disposal of the deceased’s body, the removal of the hard drive of the CCTV on the premises, the disguise of the Ford Laser and the destruction of the white van.
	
	
	Because the plea of guilty was not entered until the first day of trial, her Honour allowed a 10 percent reduction to take into account its utilitarian value.
	
	
	Her Honour took into account as an aggravating factor that the offence was committed in company (s21A(2)(e)). Her Honour rejected the submission that the damage caused by the offence was not substantial on the basis that there was no evidence before her to that effect.
	
	
	In relation to the offence of possessing an illegal firearm, her Honour did not accept that he had acquired the pistol after the killing of the deceased to protect himself and his son from the Nomads, or that he acquired it because of fear of reprisal from the Nomads. By implication therefore her Honour found that Bruce Gall possessed the firearm before the events of 16 April 2010. Her Honour noted that fear of reprisals was not an excuse much less a justification for possessing a firearm.
	
	
	Her Honour was not prepared to take into account Bruce Gall’s co-operation with the police in showing them where the illegal firearm was located. Her Honour characterised that action as merely bowing to the inevitable.
	
	
	Her Honour said:
	


“122   The sentence I impose must be apt to mark the community's disapproval of the serious crime of possession of an unlawful firearm to which the applicant had pleaded guilty. It is important to denounce firearms offences by way of general and personal deterrence. Both those factors have particular resonance in this case because it was the possession of an unlawful firearm by Kevin Gall which led to his murder of the deceased, who was unarmed.

…”


	
	Her Honour took into account as an aggravating factor that the offence was part of a planned or organised criminal activity and that by keeping a loaded firearm unsecured the offence was committed in a broad sense without regard to public safety (s23A(2)(n) and (i)). By way of mitigation her Honour took into account the lack of a substantial criminal record, the unlikelihood of re-offending and his good prospects of rehabilitation.
	
	
	Her Honour was not prepared to find special circumstances. Her Honour found that although there was a common theme to these offences, the offences ought not be wholly concurrent since this would fail to reflect the discrete criminality of each which required a substantial measure of accumulation.
	


THE APPEAL AGAINST SENTENCE

Ground 2 – Her Honour erred in finding the offences of accessory after the fact to murder and perverting the course of justice were aggravated by being committed in company.


	
	Bruce Gall submitted that there was no evidence to suggest that his actions in hosing away blood from the crime scene were committed with any other person. The same submission was made in relation to the pervert the course of justice offence on the basis that the mere presence of other people did not justify such a finding. He submitted that in both instances it was an error to take into account the fact that an offence was committed in company when that fact added no significant culpability to the offence.
	


Consideration


	
	There was no evidence that Kevin Gall was present when Bruce Gall was hosing out the car port. Even if he had been present, it would have added nothing to the offending. The Crown appears to accept this. Accordingly, this part of the ground of appeal is made out.
	
	
	That does not end the matter. The question then becomes whether any lesser sentence is warranted (s6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912). Given the seriousness of the offending, the sentence was modest and when one has regard to the extent of the accumulation on other sentences, the time to be actually served in custody was 1 year and 8 months.
	
	
	That being so, the Court has to carry out the task explained in Kentwell v The Queen [2014] HCA 37; 313 ALR 451 where the plurality (French CJ, Hayne, Bell and Keane JJ) said:
	


“42   … When a judge acts upon wrong principle, allows extraneous or irrelevant matters to guide or affect the determination, mistakes the facts or does not take into account some material consideration, the Court of Criminal Appeal does not assess whether and to what degree the error influenced the outcome. The discretion in such a case has miscarried and it is the duty of the Court of Criminal Appeal to exercise the discretion afresh taking into account the purposes of sentencing and the factors that the Sentencing Act, and any other Act or rule of law, require or permit. As sentencing is a discretionary judgment that does not yield a single correct result, it follows that a range of sentences in a given case may be said to be ""warranted in law"". A sentence that happens to be within the range but that has been imposed as the result of a legally flawed determination is not ""warranted in law"" unless, in the exercise of its independent discretion, the Court of Criminal Appeal determines that it is the appropriate sentence for the offender and the offence. …

43    After having identified specific error of the kind described in House, the Court of Criminal Appeal may conclude, taking into account all relevant matters, including evidence of events that have occurred since the sentence hearing, that a lesser sentence is the appropriate sentence for the offender and the offence. This is a conclusion that that lesser sentence is warranted in law. The result of the Court of Criminal Appeal's independent exercise of discretion may be the conclusion that the same sentence or a greater sentence is the appropriate sentence. In neither case is the Court required to re-sentence. Nor is the Court required to re-sentence in a case in which it concludes that a lesser sentence is appropriate for one or more offences, but that a greater sentence is appropriate for another or other offences, with the result that the aggregate sentence that it considers warranted in law exceeds the aggregate sentence that is the subject of appeal. …”


	
	Bruce Gall was present and witnessed the murder of the deceased by his son who then repeatedly shot at another man as he attempted to flee for his life. He was also aware that his son then removed the deceased’s body from the car port area and sought to dispose of it to remove the evidence. With that state of knowledge he hosed down the car port area with a high pressure hose in order to remove the deceased’s blood and therefore the evidence linking his son to the premises.
	
	
	Even allowing for the mitigating factors to which her Honour referred, I’m of the opinion that the sentence imposed by her Honour was an appropriate sentence for this offending and that no lesser sentence is warranted.
	
	
	In relation to the offence of attempting to pervert the course of justice, the factual proposition put forward in this ground of appeal is not made out. A proper reading of the transcript of the conversation which took place between Kevin Gall, Martin Lapich, Mr Van Straalen and Bruce Gall on 19 June 2010 makes it clear that not only was Mr Lapich worried and seeking advice from the three other persons, but that both Kevin Gall and Bruce Gall clearly and unequivocally advised him to give false evidence as to his whereabouts and activities on 16 April 2010 (see also [144] hereof). Not only as a matter of fact did the offence occur in company but in the circumstances of this offending the fact that more than one person was urging this course of conduct on Mr Lapich made it more likely that he would accept that advice. This part of the ground of appeal has not been made out.
	


Ground 3 – Her Honour erred in finding that the offence of possessing a prohibited firearm was aggravated by being a planned or organised criminal activity.


	
	Bruce Gall submitted that it was clear from the evidence that he was in possession of the firearm because he feared for his safety following the incident where the deceased was shot. This could be inferred from the fact that the deceased was a member of an outlaw motorcycle gang and that Kevin Gall’s house had been firebombed on 24 April 2010. He (Bruce Gall) was residing at a place where the deceased had been shot which was an industrial area with no other residential properties nearby.
	
	
	He submitted that there was no basis for finding that this circumstance of aggravation existed. He submitted that such a finding could not be made beyond reasonable doubt and that in any event, to the extent there was planning, it did not go beyond that which would ordinarily be expected of an offence of this kind.
	


Consideration


	
	There is a factual error in the submissions. It is clear from the evidence that Kevin Gall, his girlfriend and Troy resided at the Girraween premises after his house had been firebombed. Bruce Gall resided with his former wife and not at these industrial premises.
	
	
	There was ample evidence before her Honour to justify her Honour’s findings. It was clear from the circumstances surrounding the murder of the deceased, that both Bruce Gall and Kevin Gall had ready access to firearms and that firearms were stored at the various locations at the Girraween premises. In the absence of any evidence that this firearm was acquired after the death of the deceased, there is a compelling inference that it was one of the firearms which were regularly kept there.
	
	
	The search warrant was not executed until seven months after the murder had been committed and Kevin Gall’s house had been firebombed. During that time, there had been no retaliatory action taken against Bruce Gall and no further retaliatory action taken against Kevin Gall. The degree of planning went beyond what one would normally expect for an offence of this kind in that the firearm was in a position where it was readily available for use and was loaded.
	
	
	It was open to her Honour to find that the positioning of the prohibited firearm was well thought through and that Bruce Gall took steps to ensure that it was readily accessible and able to be used with potentially fatal consequences. This ground of appeal has not been made out.
	


Ground 4 – Her Honour erred in finding the appellant had “reserved to himself the right to attack and kill others by having to hand an unlawful firearm which was loaded and ready to use”.


	
	Bruce Gall submitted that there was no evidence that warranted the conclusion that his possession of the firearm was to “attack and kill others”. He submitted that the only reasonable conclusion available from the evidence was that he was unlawfully in possession of the firearm because of fear that he would be the subject of a violent reprisal as a consequence of the death of the deceased.
	
	
	This ground of appeal fails to place her Honour’s finding in context. When making that finding, her Honour was dealing with the question of accumulation and had regard to the common theme in all three offences committed by Bruce Gall. The totality of what her Honour said was:
	


“126   The offences for which I must sentence Bruce Gall involve his thwarting the investigation by police of a serious crime (in the case of being an accessory after the fact to murder); subverting the administration of justice (in the case of the perverting the course of justice offence); and taking the law into his own hands and reserving to himself the right to attack and kill others by having to hand an unlawful firearm which was loaded and ready to be used.

127   Although there is a common theme to these offences, the sentences ought not be wholly concurrent ...”


	
	The point which her Honour was making was that in keeping with all of these offences, the common theme was that Bruce Gall tended to ignore conventional ways of dealing with problems by using legal and other recognised processes but took the law into his own hands. Her Honour regarded having a loaded firearm readily available with a clear intention that it be used if Bruce Gall thought such action was required, as conduct of this kind. At no point was her Honour suggesting that Bruce Gall had in mind being an aggressor and attacking some unnamed person.
	
	
	The important finding from her Honour’s point of view was that Bruce Gall was accustomed to taking the law into his own hands. Her Honour made the important point that despite the deceased’s death being largely due to the ready availability of a firearm, Bruce Gall had apparently learned nothing and had brought into existence a situation whereby another person might well be shot as a result of the use of an illegal firearm.
	
	
	The finding made by her Honour was well open to her. This ground of appeal has not been made out.
	


Ground 5 – Her Honour erred in failing to take into consideration the appellant’s plea of guilty when determining the sentence to be imposed for the possess a prohibited firearm offence.


	
	Bruce Gall submitted that her Honour made no mention of any reduction in the sentence imposed for this offence because of his plea of guilty whereas she had done so in relation to the pervert the course of justice offence. Bruce Gall submitted that in such circumstances the Court should infer that her Honour had failed to take into account the plea of guilty.
	
	
	Bruce Gall submitted that the weight of authority is that judges should explicitly state that a plea of guilty is taken into account and a failure to do so may be taken as indicating that the plea was not given sufficient weight: R v Thomson; R v Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309; 49 NSWLR 383. He submitted that her Honour’s failure to refer to the discount was indicative of her Honour having failed to take it into account.
	
	
	Bruce Gall submitted that the sentence for this offence of 3 years with a non-parole period of 18 months indicated that it was likely that her Honour had overlooked the discount for the plea of guilty. He submitted that the alternative conclusion that the discount was included but not expressly referred to, would have required her Honour to have adopted as a starting point a sentence of approximately 3 years and 4 months with a non-parole period of 1 year and 8 months, which was unlikely.
	


Consideration


	
	While this Court has on many occasions referred to the advisability of sentencing judges indicating the extent of any discount imposed for a plea of guilty, a failure to do so does not necessarily indicate that the sentencing judge failed to take the discount into account. This is particularly so when, as here, her Honour made specific reference to the fact of the plea of guilty at [122] of the judgment at a point in that judgment not long before the imposition of the sentence. Error is not established merely because her Honour did not expressly quantify the discount (R v Simpson [2001] NSWCCA 297; 53 NSWLR 704 at [82] – [83]; R v DF [2005] NSWCCA 259 at [15]; R v Henare [2005] NSWCCA 366 at [26]). By reference to the approach her Honour followed in relation to the offence of pervert the course of justice, the strong likelihood is that her Honour had in mind the same discount as she imposed in that sentence, i.e. 10 percent. There is nothing in the form of the sentence actually imposed to indicate that her Honour did not in fact apply a discount of that order. I am not satisfied that her Honour failed to take into account Bruce Gall’s plea of guilty.
	
	
	This ground of appeal has not been made out.
	


Ground 6 – Her Honour erred when imposing the sentence for possess prohibited firearm offence:

(a)   By referring to the non-parole period for the sentence imposed for the possess weapons offence as a fixed term.

(b)   By failing to make an order the appellant be released to parole on completion of the non-parole period for the offence of possess prohibited weapon.

(c)   By failing to impose a non-parole period for the offence of possess prohibited weapon first.


	
	Bruce Gall submitted that the three errors identified are errors of process and require correction for that reason.
	
	
	Ground 6(a) – The sentence imposed upon the applicant was said to be a “fixed term”. That was incorrect as it also contained a non-parole period. This was contrary to s45 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. It was also not appropriate to apply a “fixed term” sentence where the offence carried a standard non-parole period.
	
	
	Ground 6(b) – Where the sentence is of 3 years or less in total, the Court must make an order directing the offender’s release at the end of the non-parole period (s50(1) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999). Even if the sentence is imposed on another sentence so the overall sentence is more than 3 years (Cross v Regina(No 2) [2012] NSWCCA 234 at pars [4] – [5]).
	
	
	Ground 6(c) – Where a court is sentencing an offender for an offence committed after 1 February 2003, the court must fix a non-parole period and then fix the balance of the term which is not to exceed one-third of the total sentence unless there are special circumstances (s44 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999).
	


Consideration


	
	The errors identified are errors in form not substance.
	
	
	Reference to a “fixed term” is clearly a typographical error. It has no effect on the sentence imposed.
	
	
	The failure to make an order directing the offender’s release is once again an error of form. It has no effect on the sentence. Section 50(3) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 says:
	


“50(3)    The failure of a court to comply with the requirements of this section with respect to a sentence does not invalidate the sentence.”

And in any event, s 159 of the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act 1999 (NSW) provides that the Parole Authority can make an order directing release on parole if an offender is subject to a sentence of 3 years or less for which a non-parole period has been set in respect of which no parole order is in force under, inter alia, the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.


	
	The failure to first fix the non-parole period before fixing a balance of term is the precise error identified in Kentwell v R which the plurality said was of no practical effect insofar as the sentence was concerned:
	


“42   … This is not to say that all errors in the sentencing of offenders vitiate the exercise of the sentencer's discretion. By way of example, s 44(1) of the Sentencing Act requires the court when sentencing an offender to imprisonment to first set the non-parole period and then set the balance of the term. Prior to 1 February 2003, a court was required to first set the term of the sentence and then specify the non-parole period. A court which sentences an offender to imprisonment after 1 February 2003 by first setting the term of the sentence commits legal error. Without more, the error does not affect the exercise of the sentencer's discretion.”


	
	These errors while correctly identified have no effect on the sentence. Accordingly, while the ground of appeal has been made out, it also has no effect on the sentence and for practical purposes should be dismissed.
	


Ground 7 – Her Honour erred when determining the extent of accumulation warranted for the three sentences imposed upon the appellant and as a consequence, the overall sentence is manifestly excessive.


	
	Bruce Gall submitted that while the issue of accumulation was discretionary, her Honour’s approach to accumulation in this case failed to properly take into account that the offences were connected. Each had a connection to the actions taken by Kevin Gall that led to the death of the deceased. With that in mind, the extent to which the sentences were accumulated was simply excessive.
	
	
	Bruce Gall submitted that there was a need for the overall sentence to properly reflect the totality of the criminality (R v Wilson [2005] NSWCCA 219 at [38]). There was no mention made by her Honour of the need to observe this fundamental sentencing principle in her remarks on sentence. He submitted that her Honour had fallen into error by failing to take this principle into account when determining an appropriate overall sentence. He submitted that the consequence of this error was the imposition of a manifestly excessive total term of imprisonment.
	


Consideration


	
	As was appreciated by Bruce Gall, the issue of accumulation and concurrency is a discretionary one. Howie J set out the relevant principles in Cahyadi v Regina. One of the issues to be considered by a sentencing judge is the extent to which one offence can be said to subsume another or other offences.
	
	
	While these offences all related to the primary offence of murder committed by Kevin Gall, they were each distinct, occurred at different times and involved different elements of criminality. Each was an entirely separate episode. Each was a very serious offence. Each was a serious example of an offence of its kind and each had substantial maximum penalties. While her Honour may not have used the word “totality” she clearly had it in mind (see [220] hereof).
	
	
	While allowing for mitigating considerations, as her Honour did, the accessorial offence is serious in that Bruce Gall having witnessed the murder of the deceased, and the removal of his body from the location, deliberately sought to assist Kevin Gall.
	
	
	More than two months later, in company with Kevin Gall, he encouraged a witness to give a false account of events so as to interfere with the police investigation. That was at a time when neither applicant had been arrested or charged and other steps had been taken to interfere with the police investigation, i.e. the removal of the body, the removal of the CCTV hard drive, the destruction of spent cartridges, disguising the Ford Laser and the destruction of the white van. In that context, persuading Mr Lapich to give false evidence was an important step in deflecting the police investigation away from Kevin Gall as the killer of the deceased.
	
	
	For the reasons already set out, the keeping of a loaded firearm unsecured in a domestic dwelling, which was readily available to be used in the context of what had already happened to the deceased, was a serious example of offending of that kind.
	
	
	It cannot be said that her Honour failed to take into account the principle of totality. She had specifically referred to it when sentencing Kevin Gall. Since both applicants were sentenced together, her Honour clearly had the principle in mind when sentencing Bruce Gall.
	
	
	No challenge has been made to the individual sentences on the basis that they were manifestly excessive. In relation to the total sentence, nothing has been put before the Court to establish that it was “unreasonable or plainly unjust” (Markarian v R [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at [25]). Nothing has been placed before the Court to indicate that House v R [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499 error has occurred.
	
	
	In those circumstances, this ground of appeal has not been made out and should be dismissed.
	


Conclusion


	
	The orders which I propose in relation to Bruce Gall are as follows:
	



	
	In relation to the conviction appeal, I would grant leave to appeal but dismiss the appeal.
	
	
	In relation to the application for leave to appeal against sentence, I would grant leave to appeal but dismiss the appeal.
	



	
	R A HULME J I agree with the reasons of Hoeben CJ at CL and the orders he proposes. I wish to add some observations about one of the issues raised in these appeals.
	
	
	Ground 1 in the appeal against conviction of Bruce Gall raises questions about the state of the common law in relation to criminal liability for being an accessory after the fact. I agree with the observation of Hoeben CJ at CL about there being a paucity of authority on the subject. It has been observed that this is because the issue “has rarely come before the courts”: Peter Gillies, The Law of Criminal Complicity, (1980, The Law Book Company Limited) at 277. That was said some 35 years ago but it continues to be the case.
	
	
	The state of the law concerning one aspect of the mental element required to be proved in relation to an accessory after the fact is uncertain but the weight of judicial opinion (such as there is) points to acceptance of the proposition advanced by the appellant Bruce Gall, namely that it was necessary for the prosecution to establish knowledge of the precise crime committed by his son. I agree with what Hoeben CJ at CL has said about this.
	
	
	There has been criticism of a requirement that an accessory after the fact must know the precise offence committed by the principal: Brent Fisse, Howard’s Criminal Law, (5th ed, 1990, The Law Book Company Limited) at 355.
	
	
	The NSW Law Reform Commission has examined the law on this subject: NSW Law Reform Commission, Complicity, Report 129 (December 2010) at 59-70. It identified that this State is alone among Australian jurisdictions in not providing a statutory definition of an accessory after the fact, or in providing a specific offence, rather leaving it to the common law.
	
	
	The Law Reform Commission made a recommendation (Recommendation 3.3) for there to be a statutory provision setting out with clarity what would render a person liable for conviction as an accessory after the fact. It included that it would be sufficient proof of the offence if the accused knew or believed that the principal offender committed a certain offence, or that the accused believed that the principal offender committed a “related offence”. A “related offence” was defined to mean one that is committed in the same, or partly the same, circumstances as the offence actually committed by the principal. In other words, if the principal’s offence was murder, it would not matter whether the accessory knew or believed it was either murder or manslaughter.
	
	
	A similar, but not identical, approach to what was recommended has been taken in other jurisdictions: see, for example, s 325 of the Crimes Act 1958 (Vic) and s 4 of the Criminal Law Act 1967 (UK).
	
	
	It has been said that being an accessory after the fact is not concerned with a person’s implication in another’s offence; it is an independent offence against justice, incriminating the person who helps a felon to evade justice: Peter Gillies, Criminal Law, (4th ed 1997, LBC Information Services) at 202. Requiring proof that the accessory knew all of the precise details of the offence committed by the principal does not serve this purpose.
	
	
	DAVIES J: I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.

2703574,R v Simmons (No 6) [2015] NSWSC 418,"EX TEMPORE Judgment (revised)


	
	Mr Tony Simmons is on trial for the murder of Andrew Russell. On the eleventh day of the trial proper, the Crown called Kieran Moore to give evidence. Mr Moore was previously a co-accused in the proceedings. He was originally charged with murder but that charge was later reduced to one of accessory after the fact to murder. When the pre-trial voir dire commenced before me on 16 February 2015, the two men were in the dock together, Simmons charged with murder and Moore charged with accessory after the fact to that crime.
	
	
	There have been a number of previous rulings and the judgments relating to those decisions set out the factual background to the case: R v Simmons; R v Moore (No 2) [2015] NSWSC 143; R v Simmons; R v Moore (No 3) [2015] NSWSC 189; R v Simmons; R v Moore (No 4) [2015] NSWSC 259; R v Simmons (No 5) (Non-Publication Orders) [2015] NSWSC 333.
	
	
	On Tuesday, 10 March 2015 I made a ruling excluding statements made by Mr Moore to another witness (Jodie Biles) and admissions made by him upon his arrest: R v Simmons; R v Moore (No 3). On Friday, 13 March 2015 the Crown indicated that the Director of Public Prosecutions (“DPP” or “the Director”) had ordered no further proceedings in relation to Mr Moore and he was discharged on the indictment.
	
	
	When Mr Moore was called to give evidence Mr Stratton SC (who appeared for him when he was a co-accused in the trial) sought leave to appear on the limited question of whether Mr Moore should be required to give evidence over an anticipated objection pursuant to s 128 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW). That is, it was anticipated that Mr Moore would object to giving particular evidence or evidence on a particular subject matter on the ground that it may tend to prove that he had committed an offence under Australian law. Leave was granted to Mr Stratton and the argument proceeded on 13-14 April.
	
	
	Section 128 is in the following terms:
	


128 Privilege in respect of self-incrimination in other proceedings

(1) This section applies if a witness objects to giving particular evidence, or evidence on a particular matter, on the ground that the evidence may tend to prove that the witness:

(a) has committed an offence against or arising under an Australian law or a law of a foreign country, or

(b) is liable to a civil penalty.

(2) The court must determine whether or not there are reasonable grounds for the objection.

(3) Subject to subsection (4), if the court determines that there are reasonable grounds for the objection, the court is not to require the witness to give the evidence, and is to inform the witness:

(a) that the witness need not give the evidence unless required by the court to do so under subsection (4), and

(b) that the court will give a certificate under this section if:

(i) the witness willingly gives the evidence without being required to do so under subsection (4), or

(ii) the witness gives the evidence after being required to do so under subsection (4), and

(c) of the effect of such a certificate.

(4) The court may require the witness to give the evidence if the court is satisfied that:

(a) the evidence does not tend to prove that the witness has committed an offence against or arising under, or is liable to a civil penalty under, a law of a foreign country, and

(b) the interests of justice require that the witness give the evidence.

(5) If the witness either willingly gives the evidence without being required to do so under subsection (4), or gives it after being required to do so under that subsection, the court must cause the witness to be given a certificate under this section in respect of the evidence.

(6) The court is also to cause a witness to be given a certificate under this section if:

(a) the objection has been overruled, and

(b) after the evidence has been given, the court finds that there were reasonable grounds for the objection.

(7) In any proceeding in a NSW court or before any person or body authorised by a law of this State, or by consent of parties, to hear, receive and examine evidence:

(a) evidence given by a person in respect of which a certificate under this section has been given, and

(b) evidence of any information, document or thing obtained as a direct or indirect consequence of the person having given evidence, cannot be used against the person. However, this does not apply to a criminal proceeding in respect of the falsity of the evidence.

Note : This subsection differs from section 128 (7) of the Commonwealth Act. The Commonwealth provision refers to an “Australian Court” instead of a “NSW court”.

(8) Subsection (7) has effect despite any challenge, review, quashing or calling into question on any ground of the decision to give, or the validity of, the certificate concerned.

(9) If a defendant in a criminal proceeding for an offence is given a certificate under this section, subsection (7) does not apply in a proceeding that is a retrial of the defendant for the same offence or a trial of the defendant for an offence arising out of the same facts that gave rise to that offence.

(10) In a criminal proceeding, this section does not apply in relation to the giving of evidence by a defendant, being evidence that the defendant:

(a) did an act the doing of which is a fact in issue, or

(b) had a state of mind the existence of which is a fact in issue.

(11) A reference in this section to doing an act includes a reference to failing to act.

(12) If a person has been given a certificate under a prescribed State or Territory provision in respect of evidence given by a person in a proceeding in a State or Territory court, the certificate has the same effect, in a proceeding to which this subsection applies, as if it had been given under this section.

(13) For the purposes of subsection (12), a prescribed State or Territory provision is a provision of a law of a State or Territory declared by the regulations to be a prescribed State or Territory provision for the purposes of that subsection.

(14) Subsection (12) applies to a proceeding in relation to which this Act applies because of section 4, other than a proceeding for an offence against a law of the Commonwealth or for the recovery of a civil penalty under a law of the Commonwealth.


	
	After some introductory remarks were made by Mr Stratton and some preliminary propositions put by the learned Crown prosecutor, Mr Moore was called to give evidence. He gave his name but when asked whether he lived in Bathurst he said “I have been advised not to answer any questions as it might be used in evidence against me”. I then asked him a series of questions as to whether his objection would extend to answering questions about his relationship with Mr Simmons, things he said to Jodie Biles while he was in Bloomfield Hospital, things he said to police shortly after his arrest and his knowledge (if any) of the disappearance of Mr Russell.
	
	
	I formed the view that there were reasonable grounds for the objection taken by Mr Moore: s 128(2). Even a question as apparently innocuous as whether he lived in Bathurst in 2009 had at least some potential to be used against him in the event that he was prosecuted in relation to offences arising out of the disappearance of Mr Russell. Even if that somewhat extreme proposition is not correct, it is clear from the material before me on the voir dire that the evidence that the Crown hopes to elicit from Mr Moore is evidence that may tend to incriminate him. The question then became whether I should require Mr Moore to give evidence notwithstanding his objection but grant him a certificate under the provisions of s 128 (3) - (7).
	
	
	That question is to be determined by reference to whether I am satisfied that it is in the interests of justice that Mr Moore be required to give the evidence in question: s 128(4)(b).
	
	
	Mr Stratton contends that I should not grant a certificate in the particular circumstances of the case. He says that, in accordance with the High Court’s decision in X7 v Australian Crime Commission [2013] HCA 29; 248 CLR 92, a certificate pursuant to s 128 does not provide sufficient protection to his client in the eventuality that he ever faced prosecution either for the substantive charge of murder (the offence with which he was originally charged) or as an accessory after the fact to the murder (the offence with which he was subsequently charged). Mr Stratton says that even though the criminal proceedings against his client are no longer extant because they were subject to a nolle prosequi and consequent order for discharge on the indictment, it remains open to the prosecution to charge him again with one or other of those offences. This proposition is correct.
	
	
	In Beckett v State of New of New South Wales [2013] HCA 17 French CJ, Hayne, Crennan, Kiefel and Bell JJ said:
	


“It is far from clear when the older authorities speak of the entry of a nolle prosequi as ""putting the defendant sine die"" that more is being said than that it does not bar a subsequent prosecution. It is rare for proceedings to be revived after termination by nolle prosequi, and there is an absence of authority on the point. The preferable view, which accords with practice, is that stated in Allen: the entry of a nolle prosequi brings proceedings on the indictment to an end without barring a subsequent prosecution on a fresh indictment.”


	
	See also R v Mellifont (1992) 64 A Crim R 75 and, for the source of the Director’s power, s 7 Director of Public Prosecutions Act 1986 (NSW);
	
	
	In particular, it would not be open to Mr Moore to raise a plea in bar (autre fois acquit) or to contend that principles of res judicata or double jeopardy apply in the circumstances. In the particular circumstances of the case, it may be open to argue that the resurrection of the prosecution would constitute an abuse of process but that is not a question for me to consider at this stage and, as Mr Stratton submits, applications for permanent stays of proceedings rarely meet with success.
	
	
	There are a number of cases in which New South Wales prosecuting authorities have been seen to change their position in relation to the disposition of such proceedings. For example, in R v BWM (1997) 91 A Crim R 260, the Crown withdrew its acceptance of a plea of guilty to manslaughter in full discharge of an indictment charging murder. In R v Filimoehala [2003] NSWCCA 37, the Crown withdrew its acceptance of a plea of guilty to an offence under s 35 in full discharge of the indictment charging an offender under s 33 Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). Ironically enough, Mr Filimoehala was subsequently acquitted outright. Nevertheless, the case shows that Mr Stratton’s concerns about the possible resurrection of the prosecution against Mr Moore are justified.
	
	
	In R v Burrell [2004] NSWCCA 185 the Director of Public Prosecution advised the accused in April 2001 that he had decided to “proceed no further” on charges of kidnapping and murder. He was then discharged. There had been a number of pre-trial rulings by Sully J. In 2002 a coronial inquest was held and the Coroner sent a report to the DPP. On 23 September 2003 the DPP filed an ex-officio indictment. An application for a stay of proceedings was refused by Wood CJ at CL and the Court of Criminal Appeal upheld the refusal of the stay. At the new trial, the Crown sought unsuccessfully to re-agitate the admissibility of some evidence previously excluded by Sully J and led evidence that it had not pressed in the previous proceedings: [21]-[22]. There had been additional evidence obtained that the Court considered to have been of “considerable significance”: [28].
	
	
	I accept that neither the Director’s decision to order no further proceedings nor the discharge of Mr Moore’s on the indictment is necessarily final. However, even accepting that to be the case, the situation is very different to the circumstances that would apply if Mr Moore was facing pending criminal charges.
	
	
	When I asked the learned Crown Prosecutor whether he could call Mr Moore as a witness in Mr Simmons’ trial if Mr Moore remained charged with the offence of accessory after the fact, but was to be tried separately, he accepted that he could not do so because he would remain, in effect, a co-accused. That proposition must be correct in light of authorities such as X7 v The Australian Crime Commission. It would be an extraordinary exercise of the prosecutorial discretion to attempt to call a witness who was subject to criminal prosecution in relation to the same or related criminal offences. As the Crown Prosecutor said:
	


“I wouldn't have, I could not in accordance with my obligations under the Act, I could not have served a subpoena. It would have been improper for me to do so and that is a very different situation and that is a classic example of why this provision exists, that he is not a defendant.”


	
	This shows that while (as the Crown submits) s 128 made a significant change to the law, that change was not an absolute one. Ultimately, the question turns on an assessment of whether it is in the interests of justice to require Mr Moore to give the evidence.
	
	
	There are no pending criminal proceedings against Mr Moore. The resurrection of such proceedings is possible but there is nothing to suggest that it is likely. The Crown Prosecutor refers to my decision in Moore (No 3) as “binding”. Certainly the provision in s 130A of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW) is a substantial obstacle to any attempt by the prosecution to revisit the question of the admissibility of Mr Moore’s statements. However, that obstacle is subject to the proviso that a future trial Judge may hold that it would not be in the interests of justice for the ruling to be binding: s 130A(3). Mr Stratton concedes that this obstacle did not exist at the time of R v Burrell. However, on my (necessarily quick) reading of the judgment in R v Burrell, none of the earlier rulings made by Sully J were in fact overturned.
	
	
	The Crown also says that any appeal from the rulings I made in R v Simmons (No 3) would require the granting of leave or may be out of time. I am not sure that this is so: see s 5F(3A) Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW). However, one could well imagine counsel appearing for the Crown receiving a torrid reception in the Court of Criminal Appeal in the face of the Director’s failure to appeal the decision in a timely fashion. If leave were required (which I doubt) that failure, the decision to enter the no bill and the calling of Mr Moore as a witness, would militate strongly against the Court of Criminal Appeal granting such leave. Those factors may also be relevant if the appeal involved the exercise of discretion. It was held in R v Ohar [2004] NSWCCA 83 that the time limits in s 10 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) do not apply to a Crown appeal against sentence but that any delay was relevant to the exercise of discretion. Neither counsel could direct me to any time limit on an appeal pursuant to s 5F(3A).
	
	
	There are two significant distinctions between the circumstances in X7 v ACC and the present case. The first distinction is a legal one. As the Crown Prosecutor submitted, the relevant legislation under consideration in X7 v ACC - that is, the National Crime Authority Act 1984 (Cth) (as amended) and the Australian Crime Commission Act 2002 (Cth) - did not make provision concerning the derivative use of evidence obtained in consequence of a compulsory examination. That might be contrasted with the situation relating to s 128 of the Evidence Act which provides that where a certificate is granted “evidence of any information, document or thing obtained as a direct or indirect consequence” of the person having given evidence cannot be used against the witness in subsequent proceedings. That distinction is not determinative of the circumstances prevailing here because the majority in X7 v ACC appeared to be less concerned with derivative use of the evidence than it was with the “fundamental alteration” of the “accusatory or judicial process”. Hayne and Bell JJ said at [124]-[125]:
	


“Impact on accusatorial process

124.   Even if the answers given at a compulsory examination are kept secret, and therefore cannot be used directly or indirectly by those responsible for investigating and prosecuting the matters charged, the requirement to give answers, after being charged, would fundamentally alter the accusatorial judicial process that begins with the laying of a charge and culminates in the accusatorial (and adversarial) trial in the courtroom. No longer could the accused person decide the course which he or she should adopt at trial, in answer to the charge, according only to the strength of the prosecution's case as revealed by the material provided by the prosecution before trial, or to the strength of the evidence led by the prosecution at the trial. The accused person would have to decide the course to be followed in light of that material and in light of any self‑incriminatory answers which he or she had been compelled to give at an examination conducted after the charge was laid. That is, the accused person would have to decide what plea to enter, what evidence to challenge and what evidence to give or lead at trial according to what answers he or she had given at the examination. The accused person is thus prejudiced in his or her defence of the charge that has been laid by being required to answer questions about the subject matter of the pending charge.

125.   As has been explained, if an alteration of that kind is to be made to the criminal justice system by statute, it must be made clearly by express words or by necessary intendment. If the relevant statute does not provide clearly for an alteration of that kind, compelling answers to questions about the subject matter of the pending charge would be a contempt.”


	
	Their Honours made similar comments at paragraphs [71], [85] and [136]. Kiefel J came to a similar conclusion and for essentially the same reasons.
	
	
	Thus it was that the majority held (French CJ and Crennan J dissenting) that the compulsory examination of the witness X7 was not authorised by the relevant legislation and was held to be unlawful.
	
	
	As I understand it, none of the cases decided since the decision in X7 v ACC have called into question the currency of paragraph [124]. In Lee v Australian Crime Commission [2013] HCA 39; 87 ALJR 1082, French CJ, who had been in the minority in X7 v ACC, implicitly accepted it when he said at [54]:
	


“It may be accepted that the examination process under the [Criminal Assets Recovery Act] may, if it touches upon matters the subject of pending criminal charges against the examinee, affect the accusatorial character of the trial process. Even if the responses of the examinee to questions put to him or her were kept secret and were solely exculpatory or did no more than disclose defences to the charges, the examinee could be said to have suffered a forensic disadvantage. The nature of that disadvantage was discussed in the joint judgment of Hayne and Bell JJ in X7. I do not, with respect, disagree with anything their Honours said in the description of that disadvantage.”


	
	In Lee v The Queen [2014] HCA 20 the Court (French CJ, Crennan, Kiefel, Bell and Keane JJ) said at [31]:
	


“In X7, a majority of this Court held that the powers of compulsory examination given to the Australian Crime Commission were not to be construed as applying to persons already charged with offences the subject of the examination. To do so would be to depart from the accusatorial nature of the criminal justice system in a fundamental respect. Clear words or those of necessary intendment were therefore necessary and neither were present in the legislation in question. As such, it was not necessary for the majority in X7 to consider the protective purpose of a provision similar to s 13(9). However, French CJ and Crennan J, who were in dissent, did so. It was a matter of some significance to their Honours' reasoning that the legislation, in providing for a direction regarding non-publication, did so in order to safeguard the examined person's trial as fair.”


	
	See also R v X [2014] NSWCCA 168; X7 v R [2014] NSWCCA 273 at [99] – [105].
	
	
	The distinguishing feature in most, if not all, of these cases is the existence of pending criminal proceedings. While it is true that it would be open to the DPP to reinstitute the proceedings against Mr Moore, notwithstanding its earlier decision to discontinue those proceedings, the fact remains that there are no current charges outstanding against him. This is the second significant feature that distinguishes the present case from the decision in X7 v ACC.
	
	
	For those reasons I have reached the conclusion that the examination of Mr Moore would not be unlawful in accordance with the principles derived from the case of X7 v ACC.
	
	
	However, that is not the end of the matter. The ultimate question for determination here is whether it is in the “interests of justice” for Mr Moore to be compelled (or to use the words of s 128) “required” to give evidence. The principles enunciated in X7 v ACC remain relevant to that question.
	
	
	Without being exhaustive, and in the limited time available, I consider the following matters to be relevant to the question of where the interests of justice lie in the present case.
	
	
	First, there are no current criminal proceedings pending against Mr Moore.
	
	
	Second, and against that, the DPP’s decision to take no further proceedings is not final and the Court would be reluctant to interfere with the Director’s exercise of a discretion to file an ex officio indictment.
	
	
	Third, the adversarial process would be fundamentally altered by what would be (in effect) a compulsory examination of Mr Moore over his valid objection if the prosecution were to reinstitute the proceedings against him.
	
	
	Fourth, contrary to the submissions of both Mr Young and Mr Stratton, the evidence is significant in the context of Mr Simmons’ trial. If the things that Mr Moore said to police are accepted, the evidence may be quite important in the case against Mr Simmons and potentially probative of his guilt. Put simply, Mr Moore told police that the accused (Mr Simmons) had killed Mr Russell and that he (Mr Moore) had assisted in hiding the corpse. On the voir dire he said that his statements were no more than a story that he made up because of the pressure he was under having just been charged with murder and in the circumstances I outlined in R v Simmons (No 3). However, that is a matter to be determined on the basis of the evidence (if any) that Mr Moore gives in the trial and by reference to how his evidence fits with other evidence given in the proceedings. It is true that the Crown has available to it a variety of alleged admissions made by Mr Simmons himself but, with the exception of the admissions recorded by the undercover police officers, that evidence comes from witnesses whose evidence is hotly contested and who had, to put it as kindly as I can, some significant credibility issues. If accepted, Mr Moore’s statements to the police shows that he is an eye witness to the events.
	
	
	Fifth, I do not consider the conversations with Miss Biles to be as important or significant, but the reference to certain witnesses remaining “staunch” may lead to evidence being adduced from Mr Moore that has some relevance to the case presented against Mr Simmons. This is particularly so in view of the performance in the witness box of the witness Jakob Peters who appeared on one view to be doing everything he could to avoid assisting in the prosecution of his friend Mr Simmons. It might be thought that he had, in accordance with the words used by Mr Moore when he spoke to Ms Biles, elected to remain “staunch”.
	
	
	Sixth, the seriousness of the charge against Mr Simmons is also a factor to be weighed in determining whether the interest of justice require Mr Moore to give evidence.
	
	
	Seventh, if the prosecution were to reinstitute the proceedings, the proceedings could be subject to an application for a permanent stay. In the particular circumstances of this case, and notwithstanding the rarity of successful applications for permanent stay, there may be some merit in such an application. The Crown Prosecutor’s conceded as much when he said:
	


“While my learned friend's argument as to stay applications is consistent with the paucity of stays that are granted, this is one where a stay, were there proceedings to be recommenced, and an application for leave to appeal your Honour's ruling, that a stay application would be alive, very much alive in the circumstances.

…

But if one looks at the history of stay applications, and that there are so few that are granted, they need to be something out of the ordinary as it were, I suppose is one way of looking at it, and this would be one of those examples.”


	
	Eighth, on the other hand, such comments are not binding on the Director or on a future prosecutor. The circumstances here prevailing are not very far removed from cases such as R v X and R v Seller & McCarthy [2013] NSWCCA 42. In each of those cases orders for a permanent stay of proceedings were overturned. In X7 v R the Court of Criminal Appeal upheld the refusal of an order for a stay of proceedings in similar circumstances.
	
	
	Ninth, the fact that s 128 provides protection against not only the direct use of the evidence but also indirect use or as it is sometimes called, derivative use of the evidence.
	
	
	Finally, as conceded by Mr Stratton, the examination will be conducted in a Court (rather than in an investigative tribunal) and I will be in a position to ensure fairness in the examination. However, that fact alone does not change the fact that if future proceedings are bought against Mr Moore, the forensic disadvantages enunciated by the High Court in X7 v ACC and subsequent cases will be real and difficult, if not impossible, to overcome. The cases and forensic difficulties are helpfully summarised by the Honourable Justice Wienberg in an article published in the Judicial Review: Weinberg, Justice Mark, ‘The impact of special commissions of inquiry/crime commissions of criminal trials’ (2015) 12(2) Judicial Review: Selected Conference Papers: Journal of the Judicial Commission of New South Wales 199.
	
	
	Balancing those various and contradictory factors as best as I can, I have reached the conclusion that it is in the interests of justice that Mr Moore be required to give evidence. The factors at the forefront of my reasoning are (i) the seriousness of the charge of murder, (ii) the potential significance of the evidence and (iii) the fact that there are no pending charges against Mr Moore and (iv) my assessment of the unlikelihood in the circumstances that the decision to discontinue will be revisited by the DPP.
	
	
	Accordingly, I make the following orders:
	



	
	Pursuant to s 128(2) Evidence Act I find that there are reasonable grounds for the objection taken by Kieran Moore.
	
	
	Pursuant to s 128(4) Evidence Act I require Mr Moore to give evidence.
	
	
	Mr Moore will have a certificate under s 128(6) of the Evidence Act.

2703577,Simpson v R [2015] NSWCCA 60,"Judgment


	
	MACFARLAN JA: I agree with Schmidt J.
	
	
	SIMPSON J:  I agree with Schmidt J.
	
	
	SCHMIDT J: The applicant, Mr Danny Simpson, seeks leave to appeal against the sentence imposed upon him by Conlon DCJ in February 2014 after he was convicted at trial of one offence under s 59(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and another offence under s 35(4) of reckless wounding. They were both committed within a short period on or about 5 August 2011, against the same victim.
	
	
	The sentences imposed were:
	


Count 1 – Assault occasioning actual bodily harm in company under s 59(2) of the Crimes Act with a maximum term of 7 years imprisonment and no standard non-parole period: A fixed term of 18 months imprisonment to commence on 28 July 2013 and expire on 27 January 2015.

Count 2 – Reckless wounding under s 35(4) of the Crimes Act with a maximum term of 7 years and a standard non-parole period of 3 years: Imprisonment for a term of 4 years, comprised of a non-parole period of 2 years and 9 months to commence on 28 July 2013 and to expire on 27 April 2016 with a balance of term of 15 months to expire on 27 July 2017.


	
	The total effective sentence was a term of 4 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 2 years and 9 months, representing some 69% of the total term.
	
	
	Mr Simpson advanced the following three grounds of appeal:
	


“1.    The sentencing Judge had inadequate regard to those principles attaching to sentencing persons with a mental illness.

2.    The minor variation to the ratio between the head sentence and the non-parole period fails to give proper practical effect to the basis for the finding of special circumstances.

3.    The sentence for the malicious wounding is manifestly excessive in the circumstances of this case.”

Ground one – mental illness and Ground two - special circumstances


	
	The parties dealt with these grounds together.
	
	
	The extent to which mental illness is taken into account involves the exercise of a discretion that is not lightly disturbed on appeal (see Spaliviero v R [2012] NSWCCA 189). The degree of any departure from the statutory ratio between the parole and non-parole periods fixed by s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure Act) 1999 (NSW) is also a discretionary matter, which, as Spigelman CJ explained in R v Cramp [2004] NSWCCA 264 at [31], “raises so many matters of a discretionary character that this Court should be very slow to intervene.”
	
	
	Mr Simpson’s case was that after the trial, it became apparent that he suffered from chronic paranoid schizophrenia. He manifested severe symptoms of psychosis while in custody, with the result that he would require lifelong psychiatric care and treatment.
	
	
	Mr Simpson acknowledged that Conlon DCJ had accepted the evidence that he suffered a mental illness and was persuaded that he required some leniency, as a result. It was argued, however, that his Honour made no reference to the principles applicable when persons suffering mental illness are sentenced. He did not articulate how the illness was relevant to the sentencing exercise and was silent as to whether that illness warranted some amelioration in the application of considerations of general and specific deterrence.
	
	
	On the evidence, before he went into custody Mr Simpson had been diagnosed with mental health problems and had been treated for delusions and persecutory beliefs. It was after he went into custody, that he had suffered a significant deterioration when he was diagnosed to be suffering schizophrenia. The result, it was argued on appeal, was that his custody was significantly more onerous and that general and specific deterrence ought to have featured less in his sentence.
	
	
	It was also argued that only a minor variation in the statutory ratio had flowed from his Honour’s finding of special circumstances, with the result that there had been little practical alleviation of his hardship in custody or promotion of his reintegration into the community on release. This had been the result of error of the kind discussed in Cranshaw v R [2009] NSWCCA 80, R v SJD [2004] NSWCCA 182 at [50] and Jackson v R [2010] NSWCCA 162.
	
	
	I do not consider that these alleged errors have been established.
	


The facts


	
	His Honour found that before the jury, Mr Simpson gave evidence that in August 2011, he had a boyfriend/girlfriend relationship with a Ms O’Brien. She visited him on 5 August, together with some friends, who had driven to Dapto from the Forster/Taree area. They arrived after 9pm and Mr Simpson invited them all in. He was there with some others, including the victim, Mr Judd, who Mr Simpson had known for some 6 months.
	
	
	The atmosphere that night was tense. There was banter in which Mr Simpson, Mr Judd and another person present, Darren Hall, were involved, in which it was suggested that Mr Judd was a police informer. Ms O’Brien became so concerned that she and the others with her left. Mr Simpson and Mr Hall followed them and pressured them to return. Ms O’Brien sent a text message, seeking help from a Mr Cox. They managed to leave and get into his car when he arrived. Ms O’Brien then phoned Mr Judd and told him to make an excuse and leave. He went outside and asked her to come to get him.
	
	
	Mr Judd then saw Mr Simpson approaching him, with Mr Hall and Mr Crowther following. Mr Simpson began pushing him with his belly, telling Mr Judd to go back inside, and trying to grab him by the arm. He was surrounded by the three men, but managed to run to the corner. They followed. Not being able to outrun them, he stopped and faced them.
	
	
	Mr Hall then held him by the shoulder, while Mr Crowther punched him in the forehead, with what he believed was a type of knuckle duster, which lacerated his forehead. He was dazed, but saw Mr Simpson approaching, waving a knife, which came into contact with his left hand. Mr Judd ran away again and Mr Simpson and those with him ran back towards the house. Mr Judd lost his breath and began walking. He was then approached by a red Ford Fairmount being driven by Mr Hall, with Mr Simpson in the front seat.
	
	
	Mr Simpson jumped out and attacked Mr Judd again, accusing him of being a police informant. Mr Simpson told him to stay away from Ms O’Brien and said that he was going to kill Mr Judd and his family. Mr Judd attempted to leave, but Mr Simpson was slashing at him with the knife. Mr Judd kept trying to push his hand away and received another wound to the palm of his left hand.
	
	
	Mr Judd then heard Mr Hall call out “Get in the car, don’t be an idiot”. Mr Simpson and Mr Hall drove off. Mr Judd staggered off and was assisted by an unknown person. Mr Cox and Ms O’Brien then located him and took him to hospital, where his wounds were treated, with butterfly clips to his forehand and sutures to the palm of his hand.
	
	
	Mr Simpson was arrested at his home at 4.30 am. He then denied any knowledge of the incident, Mr Judd, Ms O’Brien or the others who had been present at his home. He told police that he had driven around for most of the day and evening with his own group of friends.
	
	
	Mr Simpson later gave evidence at trial, where he suggested that it was Mr Hall and Mr Crowther who had assaulted Mr Judd and that he was a peacemaker who had tried to assist him. His Honour considered that the manner in which he gave evidence was not only rather pathetic and totally lacked credibility, but that it would have been a simple task for the jury to reject his version in its entirety. His Honour observed that “they did exactly that”. By comparison, his Honour noted, the prosecution witnesses had all given credible evidence.
	


Sentencing remarks


	
	Conlon DCJ noted that Mr Simpson was on parole when he committed these offences. Nothing which Mr Judd had done had provoked the assaults upon him. Mr Simpson had led the charge against him. It was he who struck Mr Judd with the knife. He had time to gather his thoughts when Mr Judd left, but got into the car with Mr Hall and pursued Mr Judd and then wounded him again. His Honour found that the experience would have been terrifying for Mr Judd.
	
	
	His Honour noted that Mr Simpson did not have an extensive criminal history, but that it concluded by using a prohibited weapon without a permit, for which he received a 12 month s 9 bond; possessing and selling a shortened firearm; goods in custody and breach of bond.
	
	
	His Honour took account of a presentence report which he noted outlined that Mr Simpson had had a well provided upbringing, despite frequent absences by his father, who was employed as a mine manager. His parents had recently divorced and he had not, had much recent contact with his family. He had obtained his School Certificate and had pursued intermittent employment in unskilled positions, in the construction industry. Mr Simpson had three children, but limited opportunity to see them, because of periods of incarceration.
	
	
	Mr Simpson was a heavy drinker, who consumed one to two bottles of vodka daily and had a history of abusing cannabis from age 11. By age 15 he was using ice and cocaine. By 18 he was using ecstasy, with ice remaining his drug of choice. At the time of the offence he said that he was on a 2 week bender, using ice which he had obtained free of charge.
	
	
	There had been a past diagnosis of polysubtance abuse, drug induced psychosis and an underlying psychotic illness. Mr Simpson had stopped using his medication prior to the offences against Mr Judd, in favour of alcohol abuse and illicit substances.
	
	
	It was noted that Mr Simpson said that he had an unclear recollection of the offences, but admitted his behaviour was unacceptable and expressed regret for his actions. How much insight he had into his offending was considered to be unclear. It was observed that while he expressed willingness to address his behaviour, he seemed detached from that notion.
	
	
	Two psychiatrists reports were also tendered. In February 2014, Dr Gordon Elliot considered that Mr Simpson was psychotic, either as a result of an amphetamine induced psychosis, or an exacerbation of schizophrenia. His medication had been increased, but continued psychotic symptoms and auditory hallucinations but had been observed. There were also delusional beliefs regarding Sandra Sully and John Ibrahim, the leader of a motorcycle gang who he believed was his father. Mr Simpson’s medication had been increased as a result.
	
	
	Mr Simpson gave Dr Elliot an account of his offending, which included being awake for 2 weeks straight; smoking $300 worth of ice every 24 hours; being involved in a fight, which he did not remember; although others said he attacked his victim with a knife, he was not the type to cause fights. Later Mr Simpson said that voices were telling him to get Mr Judd.
	
	
	Dr Elliott was sceptical about this information, which contradicted his claim of innocence and the manner in which it was volunteered. Despite this reservation, Dr Elliott concluded that Mr Simpson would require lifelong psychiatric care, given that his symptoms persisted, despite high dose treatment. Long term compliance would be increased with long acting injectable anti psychotics.
	
	
	In November 2013, Dr Chan documented other psychotic symptoms, including that his girlfriend was Dannii Minogue and that he received messages from radio and TV.
	
	
	Mr Simpson was diagnosed to be suffering from schizophrenia. He had two episodes of similar, but less psychotic, symptoms documented in 2004. The current episodes had lasted for several months and had worsened despite treatment. It was also possible that he was suffering a substance (methamphetamine) induced psychosis. The worsening symptoms made this less likely.
	
	
	Conlon DCJ found that Mr Simpson’s psychiatric condition had worsened while he was in custody. Conlon DCJ also noted, however, that in his police interview, Mr Simpson did not appear to be psychotic in any way. Nor did he appear psychotic when he gave evidence. Then he gave a very good account of himself. None of the witnesses called suggested that Mr Simpson was suffering any psychosis, when he committed these offences. In the result, his Honour concluded that there was insufficient evidence to make a finding that Mr Simpson was suffering any mental health issue, which provided a causal link to his offending behaviour.
	
	
	It was not suggested on appeal that his Honour had erred in reaching this conclusion.
	
	
	Conlon DCJ did accept that Mr Simpson’s offences were committed while Mr Simpson was under the influence of drugs and alcohol. He found, in light of his more recent mental health problems, that his prospects of rehabilitation depended on psychiatric care in custody and after release.
	
	
	On the basis of that recent history, his Honour also concluded that the sentences imposed on Mr Simpson would be made entirely concurrent, with a finding of special circumstances and a departure from the standard non-parole period, to which he noted he had regard, as well as the maximum applicable sentences.
	


The applicable principles


	
	While his Honour did not accept that Mr Simpson’s offences were caused by the mental illness which he suffered, consistently with his own observations, the evidence and Dr Elliott’s reservations, he did accept that this illness had to be taken into account in the sentencing exercise.
	
	
	His Honour did not discuss the applicable principles in his sentencing remarks, but that he had regard to them is apparent from his approach to this sentencing exercise. These principles were discussed in Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa, [2010] NSWCCA 194; (2010) 79 NSWLR 1 at [177]:
	


● Where the state of a person’s mental health contributes to the commission of the offence in a material way, the offender’s moral culpability may be reduced. Consequently the need to denounce the crime may be reduced with a reduction in the sentence: R v Henry [1999] NSWCCA 111; 46 NSWLR 346 at [254]; Miller v R [1999] WASCA 66 at [23]; R v Jiminez [1999] WASCA 7 at [23], [25]; Tsiaras at 400; Lauritsen at [51]; Israil at [23]; R v Pearson [2004] NSWCCA 129 at [43]; Henry [2007] NSWCCA 90 at [28].

● It may also have the consequence that an offender is an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence resulting in a reduction in the sentence which would otherwise have been imposed: Engert at 71; R v Wright (1997) 93 A Crim R 48 at 50 – 51; Israil at [22]; Pearson at [42]; Henry at [28].

● It may mean that a custodial sentence may weigh more heavily on the person. Because the sentence will be more onerous for that person the length of the prison term or the conditions under which it is served may be reduced: Tsiaris at 400; Jiminez at [25]; Israil at [26]; Henry at [28].

● It may reduce or eliminate the significance of specific deterrence: Courtney at [14]; Tsiaras at 400; Israil at [25]; JW at [192].

● Conversely, it may be that because of a person’s mental illness, they present more of a danger to the community. In those circumstances, considerations of specific deterrence may result in an increased sentence: Israil at [24]; Henry at [28]. Where a person has been diagnosed with an Antisocial Personality Disorder there may be a particular need to give consideration to the protection of the public: R v Lawrence (2005) NSWCCA 91 per Spigelman CJ at [23] - [24].


	
	The case advanced for Mr Simpson on sentencing was that his Honour could take his mental illness into account on the question of not making him a vehicle for general deterrence and that it should be accepted that it would make his time in custody a little more onerous.
	
	
	The sentencing exercise had to commence from a consideration of the objective seriousness of Mr Simpson’s offending and in the case of the s 35(4) offence, his moral culpability also had to be assessed. The applicable maximum sentences for the two offences for which Mr Simpson was being sentences were 7 years, with a standard non-parole period of 3 years for the s 35(4) offence, two statutory guideposts which had to be taken into account (see Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CLR 120 at [27]). His Honour found that the offences were not the result of Mr Simpson’s mental illness. That he was on a two week bender on ice, when he committed these offences, as he later told those who examined him, was not a mitigating factor to be taken into account on sentence.
	
	
	Mr Simpson’s mental illness was, however, a part of the subjective circumstances which his Honour properly took into account. The risk of Mr Simpson re-offending, was also a relevant factor to be taken into account in setting the minimum term (see Bugmy v The Queen [1990] HCA 18; (1990) 169 CLR 525 at 537).
	
	
	The result of his Honour’s approach, it will be remembered, was a term of 4 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 2 years and 9 months, representing 69% of the total term, with the two sentences being made completely concurrent. That non-parole period is the minimum period of actual incarceration that Mr Simpson must spend in full-time custody, having regard to all the elements of punishment including rehabilitation, the objective seriousness of his offences and his subjective circumstances (see Power v The Queen [1974] HCA 26; (1974) 131 CLR 623 at 628–629).
	
	
	This was not a heavy sentence for Mr Simpson’s serious offences. Given all of these matters, while his mental illness reduced the role which general deterrence had to play in the sentence imposed upon him, given the nature of his mental condition, specific deterrence and protection of the community plainly had to play a significant role in determining that sentence. That was reflected in the result to which his Honour came. That his Honour erred in his consideration of any of these matters has not been established. The sentence imposed has not been shown to be more severe than appropriate in all of the circumstances (see Veen v The Queen (No 2) [1988] HCA 14; (1988) 164 CLR 465 at 477).
	
	
	His Honour’s finding of special circumstances permitted a lowering of the non-parole period below the 75% statutory ratio, to the 69% which his Honour adopted. It is not suggested that this departure from that ratio, was the result of any miscalculation or inadvertence. A 3 year non-parole period was appropriate in the circumstances, according as it did with the period of supervision ordinarily provided for as a condition of parole under cl 228(1) of the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Regulation 2008 (repealed) (now cl 218 of the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Regulation 2014). None of the authorities relied on, on appeal, provided any basis for a conclusion that his Honour fell into any error, concerned as they were with cases where a conclusion that there should be a departure from the statutory ratio, had not been given practical effect. That did not occur in Mr Simpson’s case.
	
	
	In the result, I consider that while leave to appeal on this ground should be granted, the appeal must be dismissed.
	


Ground 3 – manifest excess


	
	There is no single correct sentence, in any sentencing exercise. In order to establish manifest excess, an appellant must establish that a sentence was unreasonable or plainly unjust (see Dinsdale v R [2000] HCA 54; (2000) 202 CLR 321 at [6]; Vuni v R [2006] NSWCCA 171 at [33]).
	
	
	The case pressed in relation to this ground was that the reason for the departure from the applicable standard non-parole period applying to the s 35(4) offence, was Mr Simpson’s mental health; that a three month variation to the ratio was an inadequate amelioration in circumstances where he had no history of violence; that there was no submission that Mr Simpson could establish on the balance of probabilities that his mental health was causative of his offending, but that it was uncontroversial that he had a complicated history of drug use, coincident with symptoms of early schizophrenia. This satisfied Conlon DCJ that drug use was capable of mitigating his moral culpability for his offending.
	
	
	In the result, it was submitted that a non-parole period of 50% of an otherwise appropriate head sentence would have properly accommodated Mr Simpson’s debilitating mental health.
	
	
	These submissions cannot be accepted. They do not properly encapsulate the conclusion which his Honour reached, either as to Mr Simpson’s drug use, or the impact of his mental health, which I have already discussed. Nor do they accord with the instinctive synthesis which his Honour was required to undertake in this sentencing exercise, as discussed in Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; (2005) 228 CLR 357 at [37] - [39].
	
	
	As his Honour was obliged to do, he took account of all of the relevant factors, balancing the many different and conflicting factors revealed by the evidence, as well as those arising from applicable sentencing principles and the sentencing legislation, in order to arrive at a single result, just in all of the circumstances. His Honour also explained, as he was obliged to do, the approach he had taken to discretionary matters.
	
	
	The sentence imposed upon Mr Simpson for his serious offending, involving as it did two unprovoked attacks on Mr Judd, wounding him twice with a knife, the second time after he tried to flee and was pursued by Mr Simpson in a car, was the result of that process. That, undoubtedly, required consideration to be given to specific deterrence and protection of the community, as I have explained. The result, a sentence totalling only 4 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 2 years and 9 months, has not been shown to be unreasonable or plainly unjust.
	
	
	Mr Simpson’s mental illness was properly taken into account, with the result not only that the two sentences imposed upon him were made wholly concurrent, but he received the benefit of the departure from the usual statutory ratio. However, had his mental illness not also been taken into account as a relevant mitigating matter, a much heavier overall sentence would had to have been imposed on Mr Simpson.
	
	
	It follows that while leave to appeal on this ground must also be granted, the appeal must be dismissed.
	


Order


	
	For all of these reasons the order I would make is that leave to appeal be granted, but the appeal be dismissed.

2703580,Muggleton v R [2015] NSWCCA 62,"Judgment


	
	SIMPSON J: I agree with Adamson J.
	
	
	HARRISON J: I agree with Adamson J.
	
	
	ADAMSON J: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the sentence imposed on him by English DCJ on 28 February 2014 of 6 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 4 years for the offence of wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm contrary to s 33(1)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). The sentence commenced on 28 February 2014. The applicant pleaded guilty to the offence when he was arraigned on an indictment dated 2 November 2012, which was presented on 1 February 2013, which charged that he:
	


“On 4 April 2012 at Jamisontown in the State of New South Wales wounded Grant Small with intent to do grievous bodily harm.”


	
	The applicant relied on the following three grounds, if leave to appeal is granted:
	



	
	The sentence is manifestly excessive.
	
	
	The learned sentencing Judge erred in taking into account, as a matter of aggravation, the emotional harm suffered by the victim referred to in the Victim Impact Statement.
	
	
	The learned sentencing Judge erred in placing a disproportionate weight on the principle of general deterrence in circumstances where a causal nexus was found to exist between the applicant’s mental illness and his offending behaviour.
	


The facts


	
	The following narrative is derived from the Agreed Facts which formed the basis of the applicant’s plea of guilty and were tendered on sentence.
	
	
	At about 2.30 pm on 4 April 2012, the applicant arrived at the Grey Gums Hotel, Penrith. He had finished work for the day. During the course of the afternoon and into the evening he drank with his workmates in the beer garden of the hotel. At about 7pm Grant Small (the victim) met his cousin, Andrew Quinell, at the hotel, where they dined before playing pool together. At about 10pm Mr Quinell arranged for them to be collected from the hotel. Mr Quinell and the victim, who brought with him a schooner of beer which was half full, went into the beer garden to wait to be picked up.
	
	
	The applicant, who was still drinking in the beer garden, was engaging in a loud mobile phone conversation in which he was discussing work. The victim, who mistakenly thought the applicant was addressing him, said:
	


“Don’t worry about work, mate, it’s Easter, it’s a long weekend.”


	
	As a result of the victim’s remark two men in the applicant’s group called the victim a “gronk”. According to Simon Taateo, the manager of the hotel, the applicant appeared, at this time, to be calm. At the time of the exchange, the victim picked up his glass and walked towards the applicant. He had a cigarette in his left hand and appeared, on the CCTV which captured the scene, to be smiling. The applicant, who was holding his schooner in his left hand, stood up and took a couple of steps towards the victim and smashed the glass by forcing it into the victim’s face. The applicant then grabbed the victim by the neck and started kneeing his face and punching him. Mr Taateo and a security guard intervened to separate the applicant from the victim. The applicant, who had sustained a cut to the palm of his hand, then went to the toilets.
	
	
	Hotel staff assisted the victim, whose face was bleeding profusely. He was taken by ambulance to Nepean Hospital. Lacerations to his right cheek, right and left upper lips and nose were repaired. His left nostril had been split. A skin graft was required to repair the injury to the tip of his nose. The operation was conducted by Drs Wu and Sawar. The victim was discharged the following day but was required to attend the Plastic Surgery Outpatients Clinic on 16 April 2012 for removal of his sutures. Facial lacerations healed within this period, apart from the laceration to the right nostril which took longer to heal.
	
	
	The applicant went to Penrith Police Station the following day and participated in an Electronically Recorded Interview with a Suspected Person (ERISP) in which he said that he did not remember hitting the victim in the face and that he was only slightly affected by alcohol. The applicant originally said that the victim had punched him but after viewing the CCTV footage he changed his version and alleged that he had felt intimidated when the victim approached him carrying a glass. He agreed that his reaction was wrong and extreme.
	


The sentence hearing


	
	The sentence hearing took place over two days: 1 November 2013 and 28 February 2014. The remarks on sentence were delivered ex tempore at the conclusion of the hearing on 28 February 2014.
	
	
	The Victim Impact Statement of Mr Small dated 21 October 2013 was read out in court by his wife, Ms Cook. Mr Small recounted the effects of the assault on his physical appearance, his financial position, his emotions and his family life. Mr Small’s statement referred to the fact that his fiancée and their four children witnessed both the scene and the aftermath as they had come to the hotel to collect him. That they, too, had seen the event distressed him.
	
	
	Mr Small described himself before the assault as a father of four children, who was confident in his appearance, made friends easily, worked full-time in cold storage, ran a small lawn-mowing business on the side and coached his son’s soccer team, having played representative soccer himself in the past. As a result of the assault he is no longer employed, his face is permanently scarred and he feels that his relationships have been compromised by his anxiety and response to the assault, as well as his physical appearance. He has been diagnosed with severe depression and post-traumatic stress disorder.
	
	
	Mr Small’s victim impact statement concluded:
	


“The scars, memories, the pain, the mental anguish and financial stress will remain with me for the rest of my life. I just hope one day I am able to wake up and not have it be the first thing I think of.”


	
	Ms Rotundo, a clinical psychologist, prepared a report dated 18 December 2013 at the victim’s request. Because of the relevance of the statement to the second ground of appeal, I shall set it out in full:
	


“This report is provided at the request of Grant in his appeal against the rejection of his application for a Disability support Pension.

Grant was the innocent victim of a severe, reportedly unprovoked assault which occurred on the 4.4.2012. This has impacted on him physically, psychologically, socially and financially. In the intervening 20 months, he has been unable to work due to physical and psychological problems. Grant is the father of 4 children between 10 and 3 years of age and the family has experienced severe financial stress, exacerbated by the ongoing and high costs of his medical care.

On a psychological level, Grant reports symptoms consistent with a DSM V diagnosis of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). His direct experiencing of a severe trauma, resulting in injury and threatening his life and safety, has resulted in his continuing to experience recurrent involuntary flashbacks to the incident, nightmares and associated sleep disturbance. Other significant symptoms include heightened anxiety, irritability and hypervigilance, depressed mood, suicidal ideation, low frustration tolerance, reduced engagement with others, difficulty concentrating low energy and motivation and loss of feelings of self confidence and self worth. His level of stability is poor, with periods of marked exacerbation reactive to increased stress. His symptoms are impacting on his ability to function in his day to day life and significantly impeding his ability to look for or engage in regular work.

On the Impact of Events Scale Revised (IES-R) completed on 17/12./2013 Grant’s score was in the very severe range, consistent with the above diagnosis and reflective of the continuing severity of his level of dysfunction.

Grant has been receiving regular treatment for his PTSD from his GP, Dr Har who is managing his medication and has also been attending regular counselling with Christine Prentice, an experienced Trauma Counsellor. Despite active treatment, his PTSD has not resolved and his problems continue to a level of severity which would make his return to the workforce difficult. While ongoing treatment is strongly recommended and could see further improvements, at this point his long term prognosis is uncertain. His current presentation does suggest however that he is certain not to return to the workforce in the immediate future. The granting of a Disability Support Pension would help reduce the current financial stress on the family and on Grant, and could assist with his recovery in the long term.”


	
	The Crown also tendered a report of Christine Prentice dated 14 October 2013. Ms Prentice is a therapist who specialises in counselling victims of trauma. She has been assisting the victim since July 2012. She said in her report:
	


“Grant’s sense of self as a partner, father, role model to extended family, financial provider, worker, has all taken a beating and his way of operating in each of these arenas in life has been the source of his self-esteem and confidence. At this point it is the huge sense of loss of self and grief over the way his life was that serves to debilitate him and reverberates through his family. He now has to work on PTSD symptoms that will take much time, effort, perseverance, and intensive therapy in an attempt to reclaim some degree of life as Grant once knew it. There are huge hurdles to overcome and the future degree of functioning in each of these areas at present is uncertain.”


	
	The Crown tendered a report dated 25 October 2013 of Dr McHugh, an oral maxillofacial and cosmetic surgeon. Dr McHugh said that the victim’s surgical recovery has been excellent in terms of “facial aesthetics” but referred to the victim’s “major psychological response both to the attack and to the recovery”, although he said that he was not qualified to comment on these.
	
	
	The Crown tendered the applicant’s criminal history which revealed that his only prior conviction was for the offence of drive with middle range Prescribed Concentration of Alcohol in May 2007. The Crown tendered photographs of the victim at various times to show the severity of the wounds and the progress of their healing. They were admitted over the applicant’s counsel’s objection. The Crown also tendered the ERISP referred to above and the transcript of the applicant’s consent to a forensic procedure. The Crown relied on an expert certificate of Dr Wu who deposed as to the victim’s medical treatment at Nepean Hospital.
	
	
	The Crown also played the CCTV footage of the incident at the sentence hearing and tendered the DVD.
	
	
	The applicant tendered a report dated 8 May 2013 from Anthony Gunn, psychologist, who had counselled him in the previous year. Mr Gunn recounted the history given to him by the applicant that the applicant was beaten badly at a pub about eight years earlier, as a result of which he developed post-traumatic stress disorder. Mr Gunn considered this disorder to have contributed to the assault on the victim and said:
	


“From my experience, it is very common for people who suffer from PTSD to temporarily lose self control when confronted with something that subconsciously reminds them of past trauma.”


	
	The applicant also tendered a report of Associate Professor Menzies, a clinical psychologist who opined:
	


“It is my view that on 4 April 2012 Troy Muggleton was suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. It is my view that this is a significant contributing factor in the events that unfolded in the Penrith hotel on that occasion. It is my view that the scene triggered a re-experiencing event for Troy who then acted out in the presence of extreme anxiety.”


	
	The applicant relied on a letter of support from John Holmes, Managing Director of Auspits, a custom concrete product manufacturer, which employed the applicant as second-in-charge supervisor of its Penrith plant. Mr Holmes described the applicant as a “reliable, polite and conscientious employee”, who was important to the operations of the business.
	
	
	The applicant gave evidence at the sentence hearing, including as to his regret at what he had done and the impact on the victim and his family. He said that he felt “intimidated” and “threatened” when he saw the victim approach him in the beer garden. He also spoke of his psychological treatment and his attempts to address the problem that led to the offending conduct. He also gave evidence that he is in a steady relationship with a woman who has an eight-year old daughter, with whom he hopes to live in the future. In cross-examination the applicant admitted that he had consumed at least eight but less than 16 Hahn Super Dry beers since arriving at the hotel and that he was five foot seven inches tall. In the following exchange in his cross-examination the applicant accepted that alcohol was a contributing factor:
	


“Q.   You wouldn’t have attacked someone with a glass and continued to sustain assault on them if you’d been sober?

A.   I’ve never done it before at all so no I wouldn’t.”


	
	The Crown submitted that the sentencing judge could “safely find” on the basis of the victim impact statement and the two reports of counsellors that the emotional impact on the victim exceeded that which one would normally expect from an offence against s 33(1) of the Crimes Act (wound with intent to cause grievous bodily harm). The Crown contended, accordingly, that the factor of aggravation provided for in s 21A(2)(g) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) (“the injury, emotional harm, loss or damage caused by the offence was substantial”) had been made out.
	
	
	Mr Higgins, who appeared on behalf of the applicant at the sentence hearing, submitted that the sentencing judge ought not find that the victim suffered substantial emotional harm. He contended that the evidence of the emotional harm suffered by the victim was contained in the victim impact statement, to which little weight ought be given. Mr Higgins referred to Aguirre v R [2010] NSWCCA 115 at [72]-[77] per James J, Simpson J and Barr AJ agreeing about the use that can be made of victim impact statements but sought to distinguish it on the ground that in that case no submissions had been made that the victim impact statement ought be given limited weight. Mr Higgins contended that victim impact statements ought not be used to determine the objective seriousness of the offence.
	
	
	The Crown submitted in reply that substantial emotional harm was not put as establishing objective seriousness of the offence, but rather as an aggravating factor under s 21A(2)(g) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.
	


The remarks on sentence


	
	The sentencing judge recounted the Agreed Facts and referred to the medical evidence relating to the injuries sustained by the victim. Her Honour also referred to the medical reports tendered on behalf of the applicant. Her Honour referred to the applicant’s criminal history and considered that his antecedents were not an aggravating factor; nor did they disentitle him from leniency.
	
	
	Her Honour made findings about the cause of the applicant’s offending conduct in the following terms:
	


“The offence is one which is known colloquially as, “a glassing”, an unprovoked attack on a complete stranger, an innocent patron of licensed premises, by an intoxicated offender who has armed himself with a beer glass. That said, however, I do accept that the offence was one which was a spontaneous response to a situation which arose but which was “misread” by the offender due to a recognised mental condition of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. Whilst that may well explain why the offender acted in the way he did, it certainly does not excuse his behaviour.”


	
	Her Honour made findings about the harm suffered by the victim as follows (exception is taken to these findings in the second ground of appeal):
	


“That is perhaps of cold comfort to the victim in this matter who has sustained significant facial injuries and clearly has substantial ongoing emotional harm, which has impacted enormously upon him and his family. There have been considerable submissions about the use to which the victim impact statement can be put. It is a factor of aggravation which I do take into account in that way.”


	
	Her Honour found that the offence was unplanned and, in that respect, less serious. Her Honour considered a discount of 15% to be appropriate for the plea of guilty. The sentencing judge found the applicant to be “truly remorseful and contrite”. Her Honour found:
	


“. . . he has good prospects of rehabilitation if he continues to attend and participate in psychotherapy and moderates his consumption of alcohol. His evidence is that he is continuing to drink.”


	
	Her Honour found that, notwithstanding the applicant’s post-traumatic stress disorder, general deterrence still had a part to play in the sentence since the state of his mental health did not make him an “inappropriate medium”. Her Honour also said:
	


“The offence, for which he is facing sentence, is a prevalent one. A cowardly offence, and the community is heartily sick of alcohol-fuelled violence.”


	
	Her Honour referred to the maximum penalty, the standard non-parole period and found that the offence fell below the mid-range of objective seriousness. She also confirmed that she had had regard to the impact of this violence on the victim “consistent with the authorities that bind me and which I have been referred to in submissions by the legal representatives”.
	
	
	Her Honour found special circumstances by reason of the post-traumatic stress disorder from which the applicant suffers and the need for additional assistance upon his release from custody. The sentence of six years and six months with a four year non-parole period reflects a ratio of 62% to take account of this finding.
	


The appeal


	
	I propose to begin with the second and third grounds as they constitute allegations of specific error, whereas the first ground, manifest excess, is a conclusion, which may be informed by a finding of specific error but does not require specific error to be identified: Dinsdale v The Queen [2000] HCA 54; 202 CLR 321 at [6].
	


Ground 2: taking into account, as a matter of aggravation, the emotional harm suffered by the victim referred to in the Victim Impact Statement.


	
	Ms Healey, who appeared for the applicant in this Court, accepted that the evidence that the victim had suffered substantial emotional harm was contained in a number of documents that were tendered by the Crown on sentence, namely: the statement by Mr Small that his wife read out in court and the reports of Ms Prentice and Ms Rotundo. These documents will be referred to collectively as the Victim Impact Evidence. Ms Healey referred to Aguirre v R at [72]-[77] per James J, Simpson J and Barr AJ agreeing about the use that can be made of victim impact statements.
	
	
	Ms Healey submitted that there was no proper basis for her Honour’s finding of aggravation on the basis of the evidence referred to above. Further, she contended that the sentencing judge did not detail what would normally be expected to be suffered by a victim of an offence of wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm and, accordingly, in what way the victim of this offence suffered harm over and above that threshold except for the reference to “substantial ongoing emotional harm”.
	
	
	Section 33(1) of the Crimes Act relevantly provides:
	


“33 Wounding or grievous bodily harm with intent

(1) Intent to cause grievous bodily harm

A person who:

(a) wounds any person, or

(b) causes grievous bodily harm to any person,

with intent to cause grievous bodily harm to that or any other person is guilty of an offence.”


	
	Section 21A(2)(g) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act relevantly provides:
	


“(2)   Aggravating factors

The aggravating factors to be taken into account in determining the appropriate sentence for an offence are as follows:

. . .

(g) the injury, emotional harm, loss or damage caused by the offence was substantial …”


	
	Section 21A(2)(g) provision is of general application in that it applies to sentencing generally and not merely to sentencing offenders who have committed offences involving physical violence. It is of the nature of an offence under s 33(1) of the Crimes Act that the physical injury is substantial since the offence involves either wounding or grievous bodily harm (in this case the offence charged was of wounding). Accordingly, it would offend the principle in The Queen v De Simoni [1981] HCA 31; 147 CLR 383 to take into account the nature of the physical harm in sentencing for the offence. However, the emotional harm suffered by the victim of an offence under s 33(1) may not necessarily be substantial. Accordingly, it is an aggravating factor in such an offence if the emotional harm is shown to be substantial, being over and above that which would normally be expected to be experienced by a victim who had suffered wounding at the hands of another.
	
	
	The degree of emotional harm suffered by the victim can be established by victim impact statements. Such statements have been described by this Court as ""a particular species of evidence available to a sentencing judge"": R v Wilson [2005] NSWCCA 219 at [25] per Simpson J, Latham J agreeing. A sentencing judge is entitled to receive and consider victim impact statements (as her Honour did in the instant case) under s 28(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act as long as they comply with the regulatory requirements. Section 30A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act permits a victim to read, or to have read out by another, a victim impact statement. In R v Tuala [2015] NSWCCA 8 at [45]- [84] Simpson J (Ward JA and Wilson J agreeing) comprehensively analysed the decisions of this Court in which the use to which such statements can be put has been considered.
	
	
	Such statements can be used to establish the extent of the harm suffered by the victim and, accordingly, whether it amounts to substantial emotional harm within the meaning of s 21A(2)(g) of Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. As Hunt CJ at CL said in R v Previtera (1997) 94 A Crim R 76: 
	


“In cases where the victim is still alive - that is, the victim directly injured by the offender's criminal act - victim impact statements will no doubt serve the useful purpose in the criminal courts of establishing the consequences of the crime upon that victim.”


	
	The only objection made on behalf of the applicant to the Victim Impact Evidence was a technical objection to Ms Prentice’s report (that it did not contain the requisite endorsement) which was rectified on the adjourned date.
	
	
	In Aguirre v R James J approved of the remarks made by Simpson J in R v Wilson [2005] NSWCCA 219 and said at [77]:
	


“In the proceedings on sentence the victim impact statements were tendered and admitted without objection. No submissions were made in the proceedings on sentence that the use of the victim impact statements should be limited or that the evidentiary weight to be given to them should be limited. In these circumstances the sentencing judge could properly use the victim impact statements to establish the aggravating factor in s 21A(2)(g) [of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act].”


	
	Although the applicant’s counsel made submissions about the weight that could be accorded to the Victim Impact Evidence at the sentence hearing, he did not seek to cross-examine any of the authors of the reports. While s 30A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act does not appear to envisage that the author of the statement will be cross-examined, the position might be otherwise where the author of a so-called victim impact statement is an expert, rather than a victim. Although Ms Rotundo’s report was accompanied by a form referable to s 30 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and no submission was made that Ms Rotundo was not a qualified person within the meaning of reg 8 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Regulations 2010 (NSW), reg 11 provides that only one victim impact statement may be tendered in respect of each victim. In these circumstances Ms Rotundo’s report may not have been a victim impact statement as such. It was, however, admissible as evidence from a qualified person on the impact of the incident on Mr Small. Accordingly, Mr Higgins could have required her for cross-examination. In any event, no such request was made.
	
	
	There was, however, no impediment to Mr Higgins cross-examining either Ms Prentice or Dr McHugh, although the latter, while noting the psychological reaction, admitted that he was not qualified to comment on it. Accordingly, their evidence as to the emotional harm suffered by the victim stands unchallenged.
	
	
	Although the applicant contended in this Court that her Honour did not specifically address the level of emotional harm that would normally be expected to be suffered by a victim of an s 33(1) offence, I do not consider that this was required in the circumstances of the present case, particularly in remarks on sentence delivered ex tempore. Mr Small’s response was, in my view, plainly greater than one would expect, particularly where he has, as Dr McHugh opined, largely recovered from his physical injuries. The victim’s continuing and apparently entrenched emotional reaction to the assault must be regarded as exceptional. At all events, it was, in my view, open to her Honour to find that Mr Small has suffered “substantial ongoing emotional harm which has impacted enormously on him and his family”. Her Honour was obliged, in light of that finding, to take it into account as an aggravating factor, by reason of the mandatory wording in s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.
	
	
	For these reasons the second ground has not been made out.
	


Ground 3: disproportionate weight placed on the principle of general deterrence in circumstances where a causal nexus was found to exist between the applicant’s mental illness and his offending behaviour.


	
	The applicant contended that her Honour gave too much weight to general deterrence in circumstances where he was found to have “misread” the situation and to have construed the victim’s conduct in approaching him to constitute, contrary to the fact, a threat of violence. Ms Healy submitted that, as the applicant’s interpretation of the victim’s benign act was caused by his post-traumatic stress disorder, her Honour ought not to have accorded so much weight to general deterrence, although she conceded that her Honour was obliged to take it into account.
	
	
	The first difficulty with this submission is that the weight to be given to the various, and at times conflicting, purposes of sentencing was a matter for the sentencing judge and could not be determined as a matter of mathematics: Veen v The Queen (No. 2) [1988] HCA 14; 164 CLR 465 at 476; Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at [39]. It is not an error of law if the weight attributed to a particular consideration is too great or too little, unless the result is outside the bounds of a proper exercise of discretion: Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko-Wallsend Ltd [1986] HCA 40; 162 CLR 24, at 41 per Mason J.
	
	
	The second difficulty is that although general deterrence was a factor that her Honour took into account, one cannot reliably discern what weight was given to it or what impact it had on the length of the sentence. The reason for this is that sentencing is a process of “instinctive synthesis” (Wong v The Queen [2001] HCA 64; 207 CLR 584 at [75]) of several relevant factors, which may point in different directions.
	
	
	The third difficulty with the applicant’s submission is that a mental condition cannot be regarded as either mitigating or aggravating since it depends on the circumstances: it may, for example, diminish moral culpability and lessen the requirement for general deterrence but may increase the risk of future offending: R v Engert (1995) 84 A Crim R 67 per Gleeson CJ. The applicant’s pre-existing post-traumatic stress disorder (exacerbated by intoxication) may have compromised his capacity to appreciate that the victim meant him no harm when he walked towards him in the beer garden and led him to misconstrue a friendly approach as an imminent attack. This, of itself, would tend to reduce the moral culpability of his acts, since, from the applicant’s point of view, the assault was not an unprovoked act of violence on a blameless victim, although that was what it was as a matter of objective fact. However, a person who cannot reliably adjudge risk and who tends to act precipitately with violence against a non-existent threat when intoxicated poses a danger to the community. That the mental condition may have caused or contributed to the offence is the beginning, not the end, of the relevant inquiry.
	
	
	For these reasons I do not consider the third ground to have been made out.
	


Ground 1: manifest excess


	
	The maximum penalty for the offence is 25 years imprisonment. The standard non-parole period is seven years. These are relevant legislative guideposts: Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120, at [27].
	
	
	The starting point for the sentence imposed (before the 15% reduction for the plea of guilty) was seven years and seven months. Her Honour considered the objective seriousness of the offence to be below the mid-range.
	
	
	Having regard to the relevant factors, including the nature of the offence, the substantial emotional harm to the victim, the need for general deterrence, the contribution of intoxication to the applicant’s misapprehension of the victim’s approach and the legislative guideposts referred to above, I am not persuaded that the sentence imposed is manifestly excessive. Accordingly, the first ground has not been made out.
	


Proposed orders


	
	The orders I propose are:
	



	
	Leave to appeal granted.
	
	
	Appeal dismissed.

	An order was made under section 64 of the Civil and Administrative Tribunal Act 2013 restricting publication of information that will identify the applicant, any victims, witnesses or evidence given and received in the Tribunal hearing or in relation to the proceedings which is likely to identify those persons.
	
	
	This matter was heard by the Tribunal on 24 November 2014 by Senior Member Andrews. The Senior Member has since become unavailable to complete the matter. The President of the Tribunal has replaced the Senior Member for these proceedings with myself, pursuant to section 52 of the Civil and Administrative Tribunal Act 2013 which provides:
	


52 Reconstitution of Tribunal during proceedings

(1) The President may replace the member, or one of the members, constituting the Tribunal after the consideration of a matter by the Tribunal has commenced if, before the matter is determined, the member:

(a) becomes unavailable for any reason, or

(b) ceases to be a member, or

(c) ceases to have a qualification required for participation in the proceedings.

(2) The President may not replace a member unless the President has first:

(a) afforded the parties an opportunity to make submissions about the proposed replacement, and

(b) taken any such submissions into account.

(3) The Tribunal as so reconstituted is to have regard to the evidence, submissions and decisions in relation to the matter that were given or made before the Tribunal was reconstituted.


	
	The Divisional Registrar wrote to the parties concerning the proposed reconstitution in March 2015. On 1 April 2015, in the absence of any submissions to the contrary by the Parties, the President replaced the Member in this case and the Tribunal was reconstituted. I have had regard to the matters referred to in section 52 (3) of the Civil and Administrative Tribunal Act 2013 in my consideration of the matter. In this regard I have listened carefully to the entire 290 minutes of the oral evidence and submissions from 24 November 2014 in addition to having regard to all the evidence and material filed in the proceedings.
	
	
	The jurisdiction of the Tribunal under section 28 of the Child Protection (Working with Children) Act 2012 (‘the Act’) is protective and not punitive in nature: Commission for Children and Young People v FZ [2011] NSWCA 111, per Young JA at [61]. The purpose underlying the analysis of the evidence is to achieve that protective goal: see sections 3 and 4 of the Act.
	


3 Object of Act

The object of this Act is to protect children:

(a) by not permitting certain persons to engage in child-related work, and

(b) by requiring persons engaged in child-related work to have working with children check clearances.

4 Safety, welfare and well-being of children to be paramount consideration

The safety, welfare and well-being of children and, in particular, protecting them from child abuse, is the paramount consideration in the operation of this Act.


	
	These proceedings arise because on 7 July 2014, the Children's Guardian made a decision to refuse to grant BKG a Working with Children Check clearance. On 15 July 2014 the applicant BKG applied to the Tribunal for a review of the Children's Guardian's decision pursuant to section 27 of the Act.
	


Background


	
	On 22 July 2013 the applicant, applied for a Working with Children Check clearance from the respondent. The applicant requires a Working with Children Check clearance because his partner is the authorised carer of three children through a formal arrangement with the Department of Family and Community Services. This arrangement has been in place since 2007. The applicant resided at the address where his partner and the three children lived, but was required to move out of those premises in 2013 due to the requirement to obtain a working with children clearance from the Children’s Guardian.
	
	
	Section 10 of the Act provides that an adult person, who resides at the home of an authorised carer, must hold a working with children check clearance or have made a current application to the Children’s Guardian for a clearance.
	
	
	The respondent was required under to Act to process the applicant’s application for a working with children check clearance, and as a result, in this instance conduct a risk assessment. The matter was referred for a risk assessment under the Act on 2 September 2013.
	
	
	It is not in dispute that the applicant has been convicted of offences which triggered the respondent conducting a risk assessment to determine whether the applicant poses a risk to the safety of children. (See clause 1(1) (b) of Schedule 1 and Part 3, Division 3 of the Act).
	
	
	On 2 September 2013 the respondent forwarded a request for further information to the applicant. The applicant was invited to make written submissions, and provide references.
	
	
	On 5 November 2013 the respondent followed up the request for further information with a letter. Whilst there had been e-mail and telephone attempts to contact the applicant following the 2 September 2013 contact, no other contact or information had been received.
	
	
	On 3 February 2014 the respondent advised the applicant by letter in accordance with section 19 of the Act that it proposed to refuse the application for a clearance. The purpose of this notice was to again give the applicant the opportunity to submit documents to assist in the respondent's risk assessment. The respondent did not receive a reply to the notice and consequently proceeded to finalise the review in the absence of any documents from the applicant.
	
	
	On 7 July 2014 the respondent refused the Working with Children Check clearance as the respondent determined that the applicant poses a risk to the safety of children. It is that decision which is the subject of this review before the Tribunal.
	
	
	The issue to be decided by the Tribunal is what the correct and preferable decision is having regard to the material before the Tribunal in relation to the granting of a working with children check clearance in relation to the applicant: (see section 63 Administrative Decisions Review Act 1997.)
	


The working with children legislative scheme


	
	The object of the Act is to protect children by not permitting disqualified persons, without clearances, to engage in child-related work, and by requiring persons engaged in child-related work to have working with children check clearances. (See section 3 of the Act).
	
	
	The safety, welfare and well-being of children and, in particular, protecting them from child abuse, is the paramount consideration in the operation of the Act. (See section 4 of the Act).
	
	
	Section 8(1) of the Act prohibits a person from engaging in child-related work, unless the person holds the relevant working with children check clearance or there is a current application by the person to the Children's Guardian for the relevant working with children check clearance. A breach of section 8(1) is an offence.
	
	
	The definition of ""child related work"" includes a ""worker engaged in work in a child related role referred to in subsection (3)."" (See section 6(1) (b) of the Act).
	
	
	A child related role is set out in section 6(3) of the Act. For the purposes of the Act, an authorised carer is a child related role in accordance with section 6 (3) (c).
	
	
	In addition Division 3 of Part 2 of the Act provides for additional persons who must obtain a clearance.
	


10 Adult persons residing with authorised carers or persons providing home care services

(1) An adult person (other than a person who is required under another provision of this Act to, or is exempt from the requirement to, hold a working with children check clearance) who resides at the home of an authorised carer or at a home where a home based education and care service or family day care service is provided must hold a working with children check clearance (of any class) or have made a current application to the Children’s Guardian for a clearance.

Maximum penalty: 100 penalty units, or imprisonment for 2 years, or both.


	
	Section 15(1) of the Act provides that the Children's Guardian must conduct a risk assessment of an applicant for a working with children check clearance to determine whether the applicant poses a risk to the safety of children.
	
	
	Section 18(2) provides that the Children's Guardian must grant a clearance to a person who is subject to a risk assessment under Division 3 unless the Children's Guardian is satisfied that the person poses a risk to the safety of children.
	
	
	Part 4 of the Act deals with reviews and appeals. Section 27 makes provision for administrative review, by the NSW Civil and Administrative Tribunal, of decisions of the Children's Guardian.
	
	
	Section 27 (1) of the Act makes provision for administrative review by the Tribunal of (amongst other things) a decision of the respondent to refuse a working with children check clearance (see section 27 (1)). The section relevantly provides:
	


27 Applications to Civil and Administrative Tribunal for administrative reviews of clearance decisions

(1) A person who has been refused a working with children check clearance by the Children’s Guardian may apply to the Tribunal for an administrative review under the Administrative Decisions Review Act 1997 of the decision within 28 days after notice of the decision was given to the person.

(2) ………...

(3) ………...

(4) An applicant must fully disclose to the Tribunal any matters relevant to the application.

(5), (6) (Repealed)

(7) Section 53 of the Administrative Decisions Review Act 1997 does not apply to a decision that may be reviewed by the Tribunal under this section.


	
	Section 30 sets out the factors that the Tribunal must consider in determining a review application. Subsection 30 (1) of the Act provides:
	


30 Determination of applications and other matters

(1) The Tribunal must consider the following in determining an application under this Part:

(a) the seriousness of the offences with respect to which the person is a disqualified person or any matters that caused a refusal of a clearance or imposition of an interim bar,

(b) the period of time since those offences or matters occurred and the conduct of the person since they occurred,

(c) the age of the person at the time the offences or matters occurred,

(d) the age of each victim of any relevant offence or conduct at the time they occurred and any matters relating to the vulnerability of the victim,

(e) the difference in age between the victim and the person and the relationship (if any) between the victim and the person,

(f) whether the person knew, or could reasonably have known, that the victim was a child,

(g) the person’s present age,

(h) the seriousness of the person’s total criminal record and the conduct of the person since the offences occurred,

(i) the likelihood of any repetition by the person of the offences or conduct and the impact on children of any such repetition,

(j) any information given by the applicant in, or in relation to, the application,

(k) any other matters that the Children’s Guardian considers necessary.

Burden of Proof


	
	The jurisdiction of the Tribunal under section 27 of the Act is protective and not punitive in nature: BJB v Office of the Children's Guardian [2014] NSWCATAD 111 at [110] AYU v NSW Office of the Children's Guardian [2014] NSWCATAD 69, at [34]; Commission for Children and Young People v FZ [2011] NSWCA 111, per Young JA at [61] and R v Commission for Children and Young People [2002] NSWIRComm 101 at [130]
	
	
	The Act is silent as to where the onus lies in relation to an application for administrative review under Part 4 of the Act. It has been held that neither party bears an onus of proof in relation to an application under section 27 of the Act; BJB v The Children's Guardian (No. 2) [2014] NSWCATAD 164 at [32].
	
	
	An application pursuant to section 27 is a merits review and not a review in which the applicant must show that the decision maker was wrong: Re Control Investments Pty Ltd v Australian Broadcasting Tribunal (No. 2) (1981) 3 ALD 88.
	
	
	In addition, in this case there is no presumption that the applicant poses a risk to children as there would be if the applicant were a disqualified person seeking an enabling order pursuant to s28 of the Act.
	


Risk to the safety of children


	
	In this application, an issue for determination is whether the applicant, on the balance of probabilities, poses a risk to the safety of children. In that regard, the Tribunal is required to have regard to the matters contained in section 30(1) of the Act in deciding this issue. (See paragraph 26 above). Section 15 (4) sets out the criteria which the Children’s Guardian may consider. The Tribunal in its administrative review considers similar criteria in that section 15 (4) and 30 (1) are drafted in similar but not identical terms. An important distinction is the word “may” in 15 (4) and “must” in 30 (1).
	
	
	The meaning of the word 'risk' was previously considered by Young CJ (in Equity) in Commission for Children and Young People v V [2002] NSWSC 949; 56 NSWLR 476, at [42]. That consideration was made in the context of section 9(4) of the former Child Protection (Prohibited Employment) Act 1998 ('the Repealed Act'.) At [42], His Honour said:
	


'42 One does not define risk as meaning minimal risk. One would …exclude fanciful or theoretical risk but what one is looking for is whether, in all the circumstances, there is a real and appreciable risk in the sense of a risk that is greater than the risk of any adult preying on a child. One, however, must link the word ""risk"" with the words that follow, namely, ""to the safety of children"". ...'


	
	These observations of Young CJ (in Equity) have continued to be cited with approval, by the Administrative Decisions Tribunal, in construing the meaning of 'risk' as it appeared in section 33J(1) of the repealed Part 7 of the Commission for Children and Young People Act 1998: see ADV v Commission for Children and Young People [2012] NSWADT 8.
	
	
	The remarks have also been cited with approval in AYU v NSW Office of the Children's Guardian [2014] NSWCATAD 69, BFC v The Children's Guardian [2014] NSWCATAD 90, BFX v Children's Guardian [2014] NSWCATAD 115 and also in BJB v NSW Office of the Children's Guardian (No 2) 2014 NSWCAT 164 at [33] before this Tribunal.
	


The Issue


	
	The primary issue before the Tribunal in this application as outlined at paragraph 15 above, is what the correct and preferable decision is having regard to the material before the Tribunal in relation to the granting of a working with children check clearance in relation to the applicant: section 63 Administrative Decisions Review Act 1997.
	
	
	As outlined at paragraph 30 (above), there is no presumption under section 27 of the Act that the applicant poses a risk to children as the applicant is not a disqualified person (seeking an enabling order) under the Act. I note the applicant’s written submissions filed by his solicitor seek (amongst other things) an enabling order at paragraph 7. This I take to be an error in that this application is for a clearance under section 18 (2) of the Act.
	
	
	The matters referred to in Schedule 1 of the Act which triggered a risk assessment (see paragraph 22 above) were: common assault, and assault child under 12. Both offences were brought under section 61 of the Crimes Act 1900. The section provides:
	


61 Common assault prosecuted by indictment

Whosoever assaults any person, although not occasioning actual bodily harm, shall be liable to imprisonment for two years.


	
	It is uncontroversial that each offence constituted a ‘trigger offence’ for the purposes of Schedule 1 of the Act. The applicant was an adult at the time of each offence, and the offences were committed against a child. The first ‘trigger’ offence being an assault of the applicant’s 17 year old male cousin, whereby an altercation took place outside the local Courthouse following an alleged assault on the applicant by his cousin the evening before. This occurred in September 1988. The second ‘trigger’ offence involved the holding and swinging (by the leg) of the applicant’s infant daughter, following an altercation with the child’s mother who had run out of the dwelling leaving the child with the applicant. This offence occurred in December 1988.
	
	
	As a result both offences fall within the terms of Schedule 1 Clause (4) of the Act.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that as he had not engaged in or been convicted of a disqualifying offence under Schedule 2, (see section 18 (1) ) and that as he was subject to a risk assessment (see section 18 (3) ), then the decision not to grant a clearance by the respondent is based solely on the provisions of section 18 (2) of the Act. That is, that the respondent is satisfied that the applicant poses a risk to the safety of children.
	
	
	By letter dated 7 July 2014 the respondent determined that:
	


In reviewing your application and in the absence of any document or information which you could have provided as part of the assessment process, the OCG has decided to refuse to grant you a Working with Children Check clearance, as the OCG has determined that you pose a risk to the safety of children. This decision is based on:

The seriousness of the offences

The seriousness of your total criminal record

The period of time since the offences occurred

The age of each victim

The vulnerability of the victim

The difference in age between you and the victim and your relationship with the victim

You knew, or could reasonably have known, that the victim was a child


	
	I note that the criteria that the decision was based upon, in part replicate the relevant considerations under section 15 (4) of the Act.
	


The Evidence and Consideration of the Evidence


	
	The applicant relied upon the following material:
	



	
	His affidavit sworn / adopted 24 November 2014 at the hearing.
	
	
	The affidavit of his partner affirmed 5 November 2014
	
	
	Written submissions filed 4 November 2014
	
	
	The Forensic Psychological Risk Assessment Report of Ms Caroline Hare Forensic Psychologist dated 29 October 2014
	



	
	In addition the applicant relied on the oral evidence given at the hearing by himself, his partner and Ms Hare, as well as counsel’s oral submissions.
	
	
	The respondent relied upon the following material:
	



	
	The detailed reasons for decision filed 23 July 2014 pursuant to the Tribunal Direction of 18 July 2014.
	
	
	The bundle of section 58 documents filed 7 August 2014.
	
	
	The additional bundle of documents filed by the Respondent on 14 November 2014.
	
	
	The further bundle of documents filed on 24 November 2014 during the hearing which supplemented the initial section 58 documents filed on 7 August 2014.
	
	
	The documents produced under summons issued by the Divisional Registrar at the request of the respondent from the NSW Police Force.
	



	
	At the hearing the applicant gave oral evidence and was cross-examined by counsel for the respondent. The applicant’s partner also gave oral evidence and was cross examined by counsel for the respondent.
	
	
	As outlined above in support of his application the applicant filed a report of Forensic Psychologist Ms C Hare. The applicant called Ms Hare who gave oral evidence and she was also subject to questioning by the respondent’s counsel.
	


Evidence relating to section 30 (1) considerations

(a) The seriousness of the offences with respect to which the person is a disqualified person or any matters that caused a refusal of a clearance imposition of an interim bar.

Trigger offences


	
	1988 Common Assault – In September 1988 the applicant assaulted a 17 year old victim. The applicant approached the victim and struck the left side of his face with his right fist and then immediately struck him behind his right ear with his left fist. The applicant was convicted and placed on a 12 month Recognisance of $1,000 to be of good behaviour.
	
	
	1989 Assault child under 12. – In December 1988 the applicant grabbed his partner by the throat and attempted to strangle her. The applicant’s partner managed to escape from his grasp and hide in some nearby bushes. When police attended the scene the applicant was found holding his baby daughter by one leg and swinging (her) to and fro and up and down. The applicant was convicted and sentenced to 18 months gaol.
	


Pattern Trigger Offences:


	
	1988 Assault Female – In October 1987 the applicant and his then de-facto partner were arguing about another female. The victim went to a local café and the applicant entered and assaulted her. The victim reported the matter to police and the applicant was charged with assault. The victim later had police withdraw the charge.
	
	
	1992 Assault / 2 counts – The incident occurred in August 1992. The owner of a liquor store left work leaving two of his employees at the store. While on the way home he received a telephone call from one of his employees. The owner headed back to the store and upon arriving saw two men at the front of the store fighting with one of his employees. The owner ran towards the front of his store and the two co-offenders ran towards the owner. The owner grabbed the shirt of one of the co-offenders and both co-offenders then wrestled the owner to the ground, and then ran off. The owner then heard noises coming from inside his store, he heard bottles crashing, loud voices and screaming. He ran to his shop and saw his two employees wrestling with the applicant. The owner assisted the employees and soon after a police officer arrived and held the applicant to the ground. The applicant was charged with assaulting the employees and convicted. He was sentenced to a fixed term of 6 months.
	
	
	1993 Manslaughter (not child related) – The applicant was initially charged with Murder, however pleaded guilty to manslaughter when that indictment was first offered, and he was convicted in 1993 and sentenced to a term of five years with a non-parole period of two and a half years. The court found that special circumstances did apply to the events.
	
	
	2006 Common Assault T2 – The victim and applicant had been in a de-facto relationship for 11 years. Police indicate that there is no record of past violence between the two of them. In January 2006 the victim came home and the applicant was intoxicated. The victim and applicant began to argue and the victim ended up telling the applicant she was going and he could have everything. The victim began to walk away and the applicant asked her “Where do you think you are going?” The victim left and called police on a mobile phone. The applicant came up and demanded the mobile phone. The applicant took the mobile phone and threw it on the ground damaging it. The victim told the applicant that she would walk back but the applicant grabbed the victim by the hair and said “inside now”. The victim told the applicant not to pull her hair and was trying to calm the applicant down. Police arrived and found the victim sitting in the middle of the road and the applicant standing next to her. The victim asked to return to the home to collect some of her items. Police asked the applicant to stand up but he refused. The applicant was moved to the police van by 3 police officers, and two officers were hurt while doing this. The applicant was charged and convicted and received a 12 month Bond under supervision.
	


(b) The period of time since those offences occurred and the conduct of the person since they occurred.


	
	The offences outlined at paragraphs 48 to 53 above occurred from 1988 to 2006, a period of 18 years. The applicant has no convictions for offences since 2006 and has not come to police attention as an alleged perpetrator since that time. Between the 1993 conviction and the 2006 offence there were no other offences by the applicant. I realise that for 5 years of that period the applicant was either in custody / serving a sentence, or under the supervision of the Probation and Parole Office.
	


(c ) The age of the person at the time the offences or matters occurred.


	
	The applicant committed offences from approximately 1982 to 2006 a period of 24 years. The applicant was aged from 17 to 41 years of age over this period. Noting the observations in paragraph 54 (above) the applicant has committed one offence since the age of 27. I note that the applicant is now in his 50th year. For some of his earliest offences the applicant was a child offender, with all of his significant offending occurring in a ten year period from 1982 to 1992 between the ages of 17 and 27.
	


(d) The age of each victim of any relevant offence or conduct at the time they occurred and any matters relating to the vulnerability of the victim.


	
	The victim in the first trigger offence was 17 years of age. The applicant’s evidence was that he was of the understanding that the victim was in his early 20’s (22 years of age), and had been drinking alcohol at the applicant’s residence the day prior to the offence. The applicant’s evidence was that the victim had assaulted the applicant the day prior when he was asleep in his bedroom.
	
	
	In respect of the second trigger offence, the victim was an infant. She was clearly vulnerable and totally dependent on the care of others. The circumstances of this offence were clarified in the applicant’s oral evidence. His then partner had a history of drug dependence and her behaviour that evening led him to suspect that she had been attempting to obtain drugs. There was evidence that he restrained / assaulted his partner by holding her around the neck, which the applicant says was to prevent her from leaving. He was affected by alcohol and when the partner left, he called out to her to take their daughter with her. His evidence was that he was holding the infant around the ankle and swinging her to and fro and that the infant was laughing and not crying. His evidence was that he handed the infant to his sister in law (the child’s aunt).
	
	
	In respect of the manslaughter offence there was some evidence that the victim was vulnerable, but that was only in respect of the context of the absence of any reasonableness of the extent of the force used by the applicant in self- defence or otherwise.
	
	
	The section does not appear relevant to any other offences in the applicant’s criminal history.
	


(f) The difference in age between the victim and the person and the relationship (if any) between the victim and the person.


	
	On the evidence before me, the difference in age only relates to the offence concerning the common assault on his infant daughter. (The second trigger offence). The relationship was of parent and child. The offences against his two partners (one in the 1980’s and his current partner), clearly indicate that the parties were in an intimate relationship. I note that alcohol (and with the earlier partner) drugs were evident factors in the disputes which led to offending.
	
	
	The first trigger offence was between cousins with an apparent five year age difference.
	


(f) Whether the person knew, or could have reasonably have known, that the victim was a child.


	
	Only two offences involve children (the trigger offences). In respect of the first trigger offence the applicant’s evidence was that he believed that his cousin was an adult. There is no evidence before the Tribunal to contradict this belief, and I note that the victim had turned 17 years of age and was drinking alcohol.
	
	
	Clearly in respect of the second trigger offence, the applicant knew that his infant daughter was a child.
	


(g) The person’s present age.


	
	The applicant will reach 50 years of age later this year. The present age is not a consideration of any import on the evidence and material before the Tribunal.
	


(h) The seriousness of the person’s total criminal record and the conduct of the person since the offences occurred.


	
	I note the respondent’s submissions that the applicant has an extensive criminal record. I also note that the applicant has been convicted of a number of indictable and strictly indictable offences. Whilst the record is extensive and in some aspects serious, those matters are not entirely determinative in the application. Whilst I must consider them, it is clear from the matters outlined above as to what the significant offences are, and both the circumstances and other factors pertinent to them. In nearly all of the offences alcohol was a factor, and often this was coupled with the alcohol or drug use of the victims or associated persons.
	
	
	There is evidence of one instance of intoxication (not abstinence) in the last 20 years, and that instance lead in part to the 2006 incident and subsequent conviction. The applicant has not committed an offence against a person (bar the 2006 incident) since he stopped drinking. In that regard his evidence (which was corroborated) was that he will occasionally have one drink (a glass of wine or champagne) on a special occasion such as a birthday and this would occur on a small number of occasions a year.
	
	
	The applicant’s conduct has been in effect unblemished since the offences, being diligent in obtaining employment, child rearing and care for his family, maintaining good health and keeping fit, as well as volunteer work.
	


(i) The likelihood of any repetition by the person of the offences or conduct and the impact on children of any such repetition.


	
	The applicant relied on the evidence of Ms Hare Forensic Psychologist. Ms Hare provided a detailed and comprehensive report and assessed the applicant as having a low risk of engaging in future violence against children, his partner or other known or unknown adults.
	


(j) Any information given by the applicant in, or in relation to, the application.


	
	The applicant did not provide material to the respondent in respect of the working with children clearance process. However the applicant did provide the material referred to in paragraph 43 (above) in respect of his application to the Tribunal. Annexed to his affidavit were a large number of Annexures (‘A’ – ‘P’ inclusive).
	
	
	The first annexure (‘A’) was a confidential Clinical Psychologist Report dated July 2007 which was commissioned by a regional Office of the then Department of Community Services (‘the Child Assessment Report’) . At that time there were 4 children in care with the applicant’s partner who is the paternal aunt of the children. All four children were spoken to and assessed as were the applicant and his partner. The Child Assessment Report was commissioned in order to ascertain the current emotional and behavioural assessment of the children; the children’s relationship with the carer and partner (the applicant), and provide recommendations for intra-familial and extra-familial contact and other support needs as required.
	
	
	On my examination of the evidence the Child Assessment Report is positive in respect of the applicant. Inconsistencies were clarified in the partners evidence before the Tribunal at hearing. The applicant and his partner provided individual and candid observations and answers to their circumstances and the specific questions asked of them by the clinician. The applicant’s partner did not shy away from discussing the applicant’s former alcohol use, and criminal history. The report concluded by stating:
	


There is nothing borne out by this assessment which indicates the children to be at-risk in their present family environment. As far as they are concerned they do not see the inclusion of (the applicant) in their lives as threatening or likely to impose problems. On the contrary, his presence and involvement with the family is seen as desirable. He is seen as someone who can protect, support their carer and interact (especially play) with them. All three XXXXX children have independently and without prompting or predisposing bias spoke favourably of him, and all three said in effect, that they would like to see him assume a greater role in the family.


	
	Ms Hare’s report (in addition to the matters outlined at paragraph 68 above) made the following assessment of risk and recommendations for risk management.
	


57. Based upon my assessment of (the applicant) and application of the HCR -20 V3, I believe that his risk of engaging in future violence against children, his partner, or other known or unknown adults is low or routine . This means that I am not of the opinion that (the applicant) requires any special intervention or supervision strategies designed to manage violence risk. This assessment is based upon his history over the past eight years, during which he has not engaged in evidence of violence. I further believe that the risk of serious or imminent physical harm that he represents is low .

58. I believe that if (the applicant) were to engage in violence in the future, the most likely victims would be his partner, or another adult who had in some ways breached his boundaries, for example seriously harming one of his close family members, such as his nephews or grandchildren. It is my opinion that it is unlikely that any potential victim would be a child, largely due to the unique circumstances within which (the applicant) previously engaged in violent behaviour towards a child (his daughter) and a young person (17 year old known male).

(k) Any other matters that the Children’s Guardian considers necessary.


	
	The respondent submitted that after considering all of the evidence the Tribunal cannot be satisfied that the applicant does not pose a real and appreciable risk to children or young people, and because the safety welfare and well-being of children is the paramount consideration, the Tribunal ought to find that the correct and preferable decision is that the application be dismissed and the decision of the respondent affirmed.
	


Further consideration


	
	The applicant provided some hours of oral evidence at the hearing. He was subjected to extensive cross examination and notwithstanding a dispute about a change in wording from an initial draft of his affidavit concerning the circumstances of the second trigger offence, his counsel submitted that he gave his evidence in a candid and self-effacing manner. It was further submitted that he did not resile from the questions put to him. Having heard his extensive evidence, and having examined in detail all of the section 58 material put on by the respondent, I accept that submission. The applicant’s evidence was consistent with the other records, in so far as he was able to recollect in detail the circumstances of the incidents. The incident in the liquor store was the incident where his recollection was vague, but in that regard the evidence on the matters that he could recollect it was consistent.
	
	
	When examining the applicant’s lengthy criminal matters in some instances the supporting material obtained by the respondent provided information which was consistent with aspects of the applicant’s version of events rather than the nature of the charges or police facts tendered at court resulting in convictions. An example of this is one of the witness statements obtained by police in respect of the first trigger incident which seems to support the applicant’s version of events.
	
	
	In respect of significant aspects of the police facts concerning the 2006 (most recent) incident, the oral and written sworn evidence of the applicant’s partner refuted that material and was consistent with the applicant’s evidence. I note that the partner was the nominated victim of the 2006 incident. Contrary to the police evidence the mobile telephone was said to be the applicant’s. Both the applicant and his partner maintained this position in their evidence and were resilient under cross examination in respect of what actually happened in the street. (E.g.: whether the partner was grabbed by her hair, whether she said to police that she would go and get her things from the home etc.). The applicant’s counsel submitted that in the absence of any testing of the applicant’s evidence (by way of rebuttal) little weight could be placed on the circumstances of the 2006 incident as contained within the police records.
	
	
	However, the evidence was consistent that the applicant was intoxicated on that occasion in 2006, and that his partner ‘ran because she was scared’. She gave evidence about previous past abusive relationships where alcohol was a significant detrimental factor, as the basis for this reaction.
	
	
	It is clear that alcohol had remained a constant factor in the applicant’s offending. The evidence before the Tribunal was that the applicant had not drunk to excess since 1995 (other than the one occasion in 2006). The evidence was that since that time he had barely drunk at all. This evidence was borne out by various supervision reports, sworn evidence and assessment reports filed in evidence. This material was contained in material submitted by both the applicant and the respondent.
	
	
	Whilst the criminal antecedents were significant, it is clear that the applicant was for significant periods in his youth and early adult life embroiled in a transient and alcohol based social setting with extended family and kinship participants. The sentencing Judge in respect of the Manslaughter conviction made the following observation:
	


At the time of the offence the prisoner was visiting relatives in the XXXX area and he himself said that heavy drinking constituted an important part of the activities of the group with which he was spending his time.


	
	The evidence establishes that alcohol is a risk factor in respect of the applicant’s past (and potential) offending. However the evidence also establishes that the applicant has been sober (except for one occasion) since 1995, which is a period of twenty years. The psychological evidence supports this position. He is currently subject to drug and alcohol testing in respect of his employment.
	
	
	There was significant evidence that the applicant has substantially changed his life in the last 20 years. He has obtained educational qualifications, established his own successful business, maintained a supportive long term relationship, and performed a significant amount of paid and unpaid work. He is currently engaged in employment and appears to have the skills and experience, as well as a good aptitude for ongoing work when the current contract finishes. His Forensic Psychologist was questioned by the respondent in respect of her opinion of any change in the current risk rating should these external circumstances (employment and health) change.
	
	
	I also note that there was evidence before the Tribunal concerning his care for children, and the significant productive role that he held in bringing up and caring for his own children, caring for his grandchildren, and his partners niece and nephews. Other than the second trigger offence the evidence is that the applicant has been a productive and appropriate carer of children either under his care or in his family unit.
	
	
	I note that other than the matters outlined above there is no evidence to the contrary to suggest that the evidence at paragraph 82 (above) should be discounted in any manner. I note that his actions as a parent are referred to consistently and historically throughout the material filed by the respondent, where they arise, such as in pre-sentence, sentencing, and parole reports etc. I find that significant weight should be placed on these matters having regard to the provisions of the Act.
	


Conclusion and orders


	
	As outlined above, the issue for determination is whether on the material before the Tribunal is whether I can be satisfied that the applicant poses a risk to the safety of children.
	
	
	For the purpose of these proceedings, in my view on the material before me, the evidence does not establish that the applicant poses a risk to the safety of children. In my view the evidence does not establish that there is a real and appreciable risk of harm to children. In my view the evidence indicates that the applicant should be granted a Working with Children check clearance.
	
	
	It follows that the orders of the Tribunal are:
	



	
	The decision of the Children’s Guardian dated 7 July 2014 to refuse to grant the applicant a Working with Children check clearance is set aside and in substitution the respondent is to grant the applicant a working with children check clearance

2703594,Tweedie v R [2015] NSWCCA 71,"Judgment


	
	R A HULME J: Carl Lyle Tweedie (""the applicant"") was sentenced by his Honour Judge King SC in the District Court at Gosford on 7 March 2014 in respect of a number of dishonesty offences detailed below. His Honour imposed an aggregate sentence of imprisonment for 4 years with a non-parole period of 3 years dating from 14 February 2014.
	


Offence and sentence details


	
	The aggregate sentence was passed in respect of 27 offences of fraud (that is, dishonestly obtaining property by deception (s 192E(1)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 10 years); 4 offences of attempted fraud (attempting to dishonestly obtain property by deception); and 1 offence of larceny (s 117 – maximum penalty 5 years). It also encompassed 7 summary offences listed on a certificate pursuant to s 166 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW), being offences of goods in custody (s 527C(1)(a) or (c) – maximum penalty 6 months).
	
	
	The fraud and attempted fraud offences occurred between 13 June and 26 July 2013. They involved the applicant using stolen credit cards to obtain (or attempt to obtain) goods at various retail outlets in shopping centres on the Central Coast. The value of goods obtained was in the order of $22,000. Including the value of goods sought to be obtained, the total value was about $25,000 - $30,000.
	
	
	The goods in custody offences concerned the applicant being in possession of stolen credit cards during the periods of the frauds and being found upon arrest on 4 August 2013 to have stolen or otherwise unlawfully obtained goods (a laptop computer and a television) at his home.
	
	
	The larceny offence involved the applicant stealing a wallet and its contents from a bag in a doctor's consulting room at a medical centre on 26 July 2013.
	
	
	Details of the individual offences and the sentences that the judge indicated that he would have imposed if he had not imposed an aggregate sentence are set out in a table annexed to this judgment.   Annexure A (26.9 KB, pdf)
	


Personal circumstances of the applicant


	
	The applicant gave evidence in the sentence proceedings. Tendered on his behalf was a letter written by his domestic partner, Ms Steffani Brassington.
	
	
	The Crown tendered printouts of the applicant's criminal and custodial histories and some documents from the Parole Authority.
	
	
	The applicant was born in 1985. He was aged 27 at the time of the offences.
	
	
	His criminal history commenced in the Children's Court in 2002. He had been dealt with by the Local and District Courts on a number of occasions at fairly regular intervals since that time. His past offences include driving matters, drug possession and matters of violence ranging from assault to robbery in company. He was imprisoned in 2005 but that was reduced to a good behaviour bond on appeal. He received imprisonment to be served by way of periodic detention later the same year. There was a suspended sentence of imprisonment imposed in 2007. In 2011 he received a full-time term of imprisonment for 3 years 6 months, with a non-parole period of 1 year 9 months, for the robbery in company offence. In 2012 he received fixed term sentences of 6 months for four offences of dishonestly obtaining property by deception and an offence of larceny.
	
	
	The applicant was on parole after being released from prison on 14 January 2013. The offences the subject of the present application commenced 5 months later. Parole was revoked following his arrest and he was required to serve the balance of the sentence for the robbery offence from 5 August 2013 until 2 November 2014.
	
	
	The documents from the Parole Authority indicated that parole had been revoked solely because of the further offences which constituted a breach of a condition that the applicant “be of good behaviour”. It would next consider the applicant for parole on the anniversary of his parole eligibility date, namely 6 June 2014.
	
	
	A report to the Parole Authority by a Community Corrections Officer included that the applicant had been residing with his partner and her young son since his release to parole in an apparently stable environment. He had been reporting fortnightly which had been reduced to monthly when he commenced the “Managing Emotions Program” on 17 June 2013. He attended all sessions of that program until he failed to attend on 22 and 29 July. It also indicated that he had been generally compliant with his reporting requirements and had returned negative urine drug screening results.
	
	
	The applicant commenced his evidence by confirming that he had written out “how [he] felt about the matter”. When it became apparent that his solicitor was proposing to tender the document the judge interrupted and suggested that it was preferable that he hear what the applicant had to say orally rather than something pre-prepared in writing. He then gave this evidence:
	


“Q. What is your attitude in respect to all these matters and the crimes you committed as far as victims go?

A. Basically, I’m ashamed of myself.

Q. Have you identified who you think are the victims in respect to these matters?

A. Yes, we’re all victims of the matters it is not just – like you said the companies and the banks and that. [It] is all of us, we’re all paying for it eventually.”


	
	The applicant continued in his evidence to relate how he and his partner had taken up residence in Gosford with her 6-year old son after he had been released on parole. He obtained employment as a machine operator with a kitchen cabinetry manufacturer but he found working the night shift was unsuitable and he resigned. He then obtained a forklift driver’s ticket and began to look for work but without success. He said he had returned to heroin use; his partner was not employed; the bills were “piling up”; and he began to reoffend.
	
	
	The applicant said that his partner had given birth a week before the sentence hearing. He said a number of things about his desire to rehabilitate. He said, for example, “I’m 29 years of age now. I’ve had enough like, got a new born baby. It is not about me anymore”; “my mindset is different”; and “I’ve had enough, I’m over it. It is just not the future I imagined myself growing up”. He stated a commitment to stay well away from drugs and he had been doing courses in gaol such as AA and the “Smart” program. He owed it to his partner and new child to do the right thing in the future.
	
	
	He concluded his evidence in chief as follows:
	


“Q. Can’t turn the clock back but are you sorry for being involved in this behaviour?

A. More than sorry being involved in this behaviour.”


	
	The applicant’s solicitor then tendered the letter from Ms Brassington. The judge responded that “the Crown should always object to letters being tendered to the Court unless they’re simply references from employers or matters of that nature”. He asked about the solicitor having earlier said that he intended to call Ms Brassington and was told that she had declined, despite his encouragement, because she was nervous. The Crown did not object to the tender.
	
	
	The letter by Ms Brassington included that she was “upset, disappointed and angry” with the applicant for his further offending. She had endured hardship being alone whilst pregnant and when giving birth the week before. She said this had forced him to “have a good hard look at himself and his actions and how lucky he is to have a family who love and support him”. She continued:
	


“Carl has spoken to me of the remorse he feels and how sorry he is for letting down not only his family but all … who supported him and the opportunities that he was given.”


	
	In contrast to his evidence, she then referred to him having been “retrenched from his job through no fault of his own”. She said he became disheartened; felt like a failure and “allowed old habits to reform as he struggled to find the necessary coping skills”. (If by “old habits” she was referring to drug use, the applicant said in his evidence that he returned to heroin use while he had a job, not after.) Ms Brassington also said that whilst she would support him after his release from custody she would not tolerate any further offending and would report him to “the relevant authorities” if he relapsed.
	


Ground 1 – The sentencing judge erred in denying the Applicant procedural fairness by rejecting after the sentencing hearing the unchallenged evidence of the Applicant’s remorse


	
	To persuade the judge to take remorse into account as a mitigating factor it was the applicant who bore the onus of persuasion that the two matters set out in s 21A(3)(i) were established:
	


(i) the remorse shown by the offender for the offence, but only if:

(i) the offender has provided evidence that he or she has accepted responsibility for his or her actions, and

(ii) the offender has acknowledged any injury, loss or damage caused by his or her actions or made reparation for such injury, loss or damage (or both)


	
	In the course of his remarks on sentence the learned judge said:
	


“I am unable to find acceptable evidence of any genuine contrition or remorse rather than the glib use of phrases such as “I am ashamed of myself”.

While there is reference in Ms Brassington’s letter to him having expressed remorse and regret to her, in the absence of that evidence being given on oath and subject to cross-examination, I am not prepared to accept that the letter provides any acceptable evidence of contrition or remorse.”


	
	The judge then referred to some matters that raised a doubt in his mind about Ms Brassington not being aware that the applicant was using drugs and was committing criminal offences in order to fund that habit and to support the family when he was not working. He continued:
	


“As I have already stated, I do not in the circumstances of this matter accept the evidence of the offender or of Ms Brassington as to the offender being remorseful or contrite.”


	
	The contention in this ground that there was procedural unfairness in the judge not accepting the proffered evidence of remorse is misconceived. Adamson J (with the concurrence of Simpson and Davies JJ) said in Dang v R [2014] NSWCCA 47:
	


“[45] The question whether a party has been denied an opportunity to be heard, being a matter of substance, must be determined by reference to the circumstances during the proceedings. The real question is whether there has been actual unfairness, not whether there has been a disappointment because an expectation engendered by the decision-maker has not been fulfilled: Re Minister for Immigration & Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs; ex parte Lam [2003] HCA 6; 214 CLR 1 (Lam) at [34] per Gleeson CJ. Commonly, unfairness will arise where someone has been deprived of the opportunity to make submissions or has failed to make submissions by reason of an indication, which ultimately proves to have been false, from the decision-maker.”


	
	The sentencing judge in the present case gave no indication that he was prepared to accept that the applicant was remorseful. The solicitor for the applicant was certainly not dissuaded by anything that had occurred during the presentation of the evidence from later making a submission seeking to persuade the judge to make a finding that his client had “exhibited … relevant contrition in respect of the offences”. And he also expressed an appreciation of the judge’s scepticism about accepting Ms Brassington’s letter because of doubt about whether she could have been completely oblivious to what the applicant had been up to.
	
	
	There is an air of unreality about this ground. It presupposes that during the course of a sentence hearing a judge is required to consider and reflect upon all that is placed before the court and indicate to the parties before delivering or reserving judgment any potential disagreement or non-acceptance in relation to individual matters despite the fact that the opposing party might not have contested them. Judicial proceedings, including sentence proceedings, cannot be conducted in that fashion. A similar observation was made by R S Hulme AJ in Toole, Kurt v R; Toole, Joshua v R [2014] NSWCCA 318 at [44].
	
	
	There is no merit in this ground.
	


Ground 2 – The sentencing judge erred in failing to apply the principles of totality

Ground 3 – The sentencing judge erred in failing to specify the basis upon which the aggregate sentence was structured and how the overall sentence was reached


	
	Ground 2 may be immediately rejected. The judge specifically said: ""I have also taken into account that it would be necessary for me to take into account the principle of totality. I have done so."" And Ground 3 implicitly accepts that the principle of totality was applied; it complains about the manner of its application.
	
	
	In support of Ground 3, the applicant submits that error is apparent in two respects. First, there were a number of offences where the criminality differed but for which the same sentence was indicated. Secondly, there was an absence of reasons explaining the structure of the aggregate sentence and the extent of accumulation of indicative sentences, or between groups of indicative sentences.
	
	
	In support of the first asserted basis of error, it was pointed out in the applicant's submissions by way of example that the value of the goods in one offence (H … 725 Seq 8) was $34.99 and in another offence (H … 725 Seq 26) the value was $670; yet the indicative sentence for each was the same (1 year 6 months). Accordingly, it was argued that the judge had not complied with s 53A(2)(b) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) in that he had not determined an appropriate sentence for the individual offences but had merely made a blanket assessment of the kind criticised in R v Brown [2012] NSWCCA 199, R v Nykolyn [2012] NSWCCA 219 and Subramaniam v R [2013] NSWCCA 159.
	
	
	The first argument is based on a fallacy – that the criminality of each offence was measured only by the value of the goods obtained (which ranged from $34.99 to $3683.90 and averaged about $800). But the criminality did not involve isolated acts of offending; it included the fact that the applicant was engaged in systematic, frequent and fraudulent use of stolen credit cards. If there had been two, or a few, offences, it may be that the value of goods obtained in each transaction would be a significant indicator of the seriousness of the individual offences. But the value of the individual transactions is of lesser importance as the pattern of offending is more blatant, frequent and entrenched.
	
	
	King DCJ did not simply adopt a “blanket approach”; he discriminated between the various offences based upon the value of the goods obtained, but not to the degree to which the applicant now contends he should have. Each of the fraud offences attracted an indicative sentence of either 1 year 6 months or 2 years. The higher sentence was indicated in respect of those offences where the amount involved was ""approximately $1,500 or more"". There are various ways in which his Honour could have approached this exercise but I cannot see anything wrong with the method he chose to adopt in the circumstances of this case.
	
	
	The second argument also proceeds upon a mistaken premise – that it is incumbent upon a judge imposing an aggregate sentence to spell out in detail how the process of accumulation and the application of the principle of totality has been carried out. Reliance was placed upon something said by Emmett JA in Subramaniam v R [2013] NSWCCA 159 at [9] to that effect but the other two members of the Court (Simpson and Latham JJ) did not express agreement with it. True it is that Latham J engaged in a fairly detailed exposition of how the exercise was carried out in the context of resentencing in that case, but that does not mean that it is a mandatory requirement. The legislation does not require it and nor does the caselaw.
	
	
	In JM v R [2014] NSWCCA 297 at [39]-[40] I set out a number of propositions in relation to aggregate sentencing that were derived from either the legislative provisions or cases that have considered the subject. One of them (proposition #11 at [40]) was that the indicative sentences recorded in accordance with s 53A(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act are not themselves amenable to appeal but may be a guide to whether error is established in relation to the aggregate sentence.
	
	
	Another proposition (#13 at [40]) was that a principal focus of determining a ground of appeal alleging manifest inadequacy or excess will be whether the aggregate sentence reflects the totality of the criminality involved. When an aggregate sentence is imposed this Court is usually not, and need not be, in a position to analyse issues of concurrence and accumulation in the same way that it can analyse traditional sentencing structures. That is because ""the whole point of aggregate sentencing is to free sentencing judges from the task of creating elaborate sentence structures"": Truong v R; R v Le; Nguyen v R; R v Nguyen [2013] NSWCCA 36 at [231] (Button J).
	
	
	I am unable to discern any error in the approach of the sentencing judge. In any event, what appears to me to be the real issue in this matter is whether, having regard to all of the objective and subjective facts and circumstances, the aggregate sentence is excessive. That is a question that arises for consideration under the final ground. Once that is determined, there is no practical utility in engaging in an analysis of the manner in which the aggregate sentence was arrived at.
	
	
	I would reject this ground.
	


Ground 4 – The sentencing judge erred in failing to give the Applicant the benefit of a discount for his plea of guilty


	
	Two submissions were made in support of this ground. The first was that, having regard to the discount for the utilitarian value of the applicant’s pleas of guilty, the judge must have adopted a starting point in respect of the sentences for the goods in custody offences of six months imprisonment. Senior counsel for the applicant pointed out that that is the maximum penalty that can be imposed pursuant to s 527C(1) of the Crimes Act. There was no indication of the judge having found any of those offences to fall into the worst case category such as to justify imposition of the maximum penalty. It therefore followed from the latter that the judge had not given the applicant the benefit of the discount of 25 per cent.
	
	
	The second submission was that with an aggregate sentence of 4 years it could be inferred that without the applicant’s plea of guilty the total sentence that would have been imposed would have been 5 years and 4 months. The argument was that a starting point of 5 years and 4 months would have been excessive and unlikely to have in fact been the starting point. This was said to be another basis for which it was contended that the applicant did not receive the benefit of the discount for his pleas.
	
	
	The argument about the goods in custody sentences being excessive must be seen in context. There were six indicative sentences for goods in custody offences each of 4 months 2 weeks. This was in the context of an aggregate sentence of 4 years being imposed for a total of 38 offences. If the sentences indicated for the goods in custody offences had have been somewhat lesser duration, say 3 months each rather than 4 months 2 weeks, it could hardly be thought that that would have any impact upon the aggregate at all.
	
	
	The second point proceeds upon an erroneous assumption that the discount for a plea of guilty is applied to the aggregate sentence. That is not the case having regard to s 53A(2)(b) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act which requires various matters to be taken into account in arriving at indicative sentences, including the mitigating value of any plea of guilty pursuant to s 22 of the same Act. Of course, in arriving at an aggregate sentence through a notional process of accumulation of indicative sentences it is important to ensure that an offender is not deprived of mitigation for the utilitarian value of pleas of guilty. See Liles v R (Cth) [2014] NSWCCA 289 at [45] (Hoeben CJ at CL); JM v R, supra, at [92].
	
	
	This ground should be rejected.
	


Ground 5 – In the alternative, if the sentencing judge did allow the discount for the plea of guilty then the sentence is manifestly excessive


	
	The question for the Court is whether the aggregate sentence is unreasonable or plainly unjust: Dinsdale v The Queen (2000) 202 CLR 321 at 325.
	
	
	The first submission in support of this ground repeated the claim of excess in relation to the indicative sentences for the goods in custody offences. Nothing more needs to be said about that.
	
	
	The second submission involved reference to Judicial Commission sentencing statistics. However the database relied upon in relation to the fraud offences contained only five cases of sentencing in the District Court or resentencing in this Court which makes the statistics of no use at all.
	
	
	Reference was also made to statistics concerning sentencing in the Local Court where a much larger database was involved. There is no utility in comparing sentences imposed in the District Court for such a large number of offences committed in the period and style of the applicant’s offences with sentences imposed in the Local Court where the jurisdictional limit is 20 per cent of the maximum penalty available in the District Court.
	
	
	A more fundamental problem with the applicant’s recourse to statistics is a failure to recognise that the Judicial Commission only records the sentence imposed for one offence in a multi-offence sentencing exercise; what it terms the “principal offence” (the offence that attracted the highest of the various sentences imposed or, where there is more than one offence that attracted the highest sentence, the offence which had the highest maximum penalty or had offences listed on a Form 1 taken into account). No statistics are maintained of the overall or aggregate sentence imposed in such cases. In short, the applicant was seeking to compare sentences imposed for a single offence with his aggregate sentence imposed for 38 offences.
	
	
	A more substantive submission was that the sentence imposed was excessive having regard to the comparatively short course of conduct for offences of this type, a period of approximately six weeks; the total value of property taken (in the vicinity of $22,000) being comparatively less than in other cases dealt with in the District Court (although only two cases were referred to); and the subjective features of the applicant, including his relatively young age, drug addiction and change in family circumstances.
	
	
	The Crown, on the other hand, submitted that the sentences could not be characterised as unreasonable or plainly unjust. The Crown submissions pointed to a number of relevant circumstances including the maximum penalties, the objective seriousness of the offences, the commission of the offences whilst on parole, the applicant’s criminal history, his assessed poor prospects of rehabilitation (which was not challenged), and the necessity to apply the principle of totality.
	
	
	The applicant’s offending, whilst on parole, was brazen and persistent. There was no challenge to the sentencing judge’s description of it being “a serious and continuing course of criminal conduct which must be of serious concern to the community and the victims, whether those victims be the card holders, the retail stores or the credit providers”. His Honour’s emphasis on general deterrence was appropriate given his finding that “these offences are … easy to commit and, in the absence of CCTV coverage, generally difficult to identify the offender”. He was also correct (with respect) to find that personal deterrence was important in this case as well.
	
	
	I am not satisfied that there is anything unreasonable or unjust about the sentence imposed.
	


Orders


	
	I propose the following orders:
	


1.   Leave to appeal against sentence granted.

2.   Appeal dismissed.


	
	BASTEN JA: I agree with the orders proposed by R A Hulme J and the reasons he has articulated.
	
	
	I would add the following observations as to the complaint that the applicant was denied procedural fairness because the trial judge did not accept his, the applicant's, own assertions in the witness box of remorse. Procedural unfairness only arises where an offender has been denied an opportunity to pursue a particular submission or to call relevant evidence or in circumstances where some representation has been made to him that would dissuade him from taking a course which had been intended.
	
	
	Where an offender seeks to persuade a sentencing Court of a matter in litigation, he or she cannot assume that the court will accept that evidence. No indication was given by the prosecutor or the court that his evidence should or would be accepted.
	
	
	It was further said that his evidence was not challenged in cross-examination, but he was cross-examined as to his record, including with respect to matters involving drug use and the fact that he had not taken the benefit of opportunities for counselling and assistance in the past. An available implication was that his assertion of remorse should be given little or no weight.
	
	
	As R A Hulme J has noted, the applicant's solicitor made submissions favouring acceptance of the evidence. There was no suggestion that he or his client had proposed to call further evidence, if not dissuaded by an indication that the Court did not require such material. Nor was it suggested that any further submissions would have been made had the solicitor not been of the view that the evidence would be accepted.
	
	
	In these circumstances, and for the reasons given by R A Hulme J, this ground must be rejected.
	
	
	ADAMSON J: I agree with the orders proposed by R A Hulme J and with his Honour's reasons. I also agree with the additional reasons of Basten JA.

2703602,Dennis v R [2015] NSWCCA 61,"Judgment


	
	R A HULME J: I agree with Bellew J.
	
	
	DAVIES J: I agree with Bellew J.
	
	
	BELLEW J: On 4 December 2009, having been found guilty by a jury of the murder of a 23 month old child, Matthew Allen Dennis (“the applicant”) was sentenced by Barr AJ to imprisonment for 26 years and 8 months to date from 17 April 2008. His Honour imposed a non-parole period of 20 years: R v Dennis [2009] NSWSC 1357. The maximum penalty for the offence of murder is life imprisonment. Because of the age of the victim in the present case, a standard non-parole period of 25 years imprisonment was prescribed.
	
	
	An appeal by the applicant against his conviction was dismissed by this Court on 8 June 2012: Dennis v R [2012] NSWCCA 120.
	
	
	The applicant now seeks an extension of time in which to seek leave to appeal against his sentence. Given the narrow issue argued on the present application, and in view of the conclusion I have reached, it is not necessary to set out the circumstances of the applicant’s offending.
	


THE APPLICATION FOR AN EXTENSION OF TIME


	
	The affidavit material filed in support of the application to extend time establishes the following chronology.
	
	
	On 9 December 2009, following sentence, the applicant made an application for legal aid and filed a notice of intention to appeal. The time for which the notice of intention remained current was extended a number of times.
	
	
	On 14 December 2010 the applicant was refused legal aid in respect of an appeal against sentence, but was granted aid for an appeal against conviction. As previously noted, that appeal was dismissed by this Court.
	
	
	Following the decision in Muldrock v R [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CLR 120 the applicant’s file was reviewed by Legal Aid NSW in order to determine whether there was any evidence of error in sentence. Following advice from counsel, the applicant was invited to complete a further application for legal aid. That application was later approved and legal aid was granted.
	
	
	In March 2013 the applicant’s solicitor received a transcript of the sentence proceedings. On 28 March 2013 a brief was forwarded to counsel. On or about 9 April 2013 the relevant file was inspected and the exhibits copied.
	
	
	On 27 May 2013 counsel provided submissions to be filed in this Court on the applicant’s behalf. A notice of application for leave to appeal was filed in the Court registry on 10 July 2013. The further progress of the matter was then delayed to await the decisions of the High Court in Kentwell v R [2014] HCA 37 and O’Grady v R [2014] HCA 38, both of which were handed down on 9 October 2014.
	


THE GROUND OF APPEAL

His Honour’s (sic) erred in his application of the standard non-parole period legislation in the light of the principles identified in Muldrock v R [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CLR 120.

The findings of the sentencing judge


	
	The sentencing judge set out (at [2]-[15]) the circumstances of the infant’s death and the applicant’s offending. His Honour then said (at [16]):
	


“[16] The features of this case which would ordinarily be regarded as aggravating the seriousness of the offence and sounding in the sentence, apart from those inherent in the nature of the offence of violent murder itself, are that the offender’s act constituted an abuse of a position of trust and that the offence was committed in the house of a person who, because of his tender age, was vulnerable. However, those matters in effect determine the standard non-parole period for this offence, and they must not be brought into account twice.”


	
	In oral argument counsel for the applicant made it clear that it was not suggested that any error arose from anything said by the sentencing judge in [16].
	
	
	His Honour considered the applicant’s subjective case at some length. He set out (at [10]) the circumstances of the applicant’s upbringing, which included the death of his mother when he was only 15 years of age. He found that the applicant was a person of exemplary character (at [14] and [18]), that the attack on the deceased infant was unplanned (at [18]), that the applicant had demonstrated some remorse (at [20]) and that he had reasonable prospects of rehabilitation (at [20]).
	
	
	His Honour then said (commencing at [22]):
	


“[22] The standard non-parole period for the murder of a child under the age of 18 years is 25 years. Such a non-parole period would apply to a case in the middle range of objective seriousness. I bear that in mind.

[23] The manner of the attack on such a young child and the serious nature of the resulting injuries tend to make this objectively a more serious case. There are balancing features, however. The offence was unplanned and must, I think, have resulted from sudden anger and loss of self control. I am not satisfied that there was any intent to kill. In my opinion this case falls in about the middle range of objective seriousness, perhaps a little below it.

[24] There are strong subjective features. The prior good character and remarkable work history of the offender help him. So do his young age and good prospects and the fact that he will have to serve at least a substantial part of his sentence on protection.

[25] It was not submitted that I should vary the prima facie relationship between non-parole and parole periods and I do not think that I should. In my view the period of parole that I have allowed for will be sufficient to enable the offender to begin to make his way again in the community with the support of officers of the Probation and Parole Service. In any case, the non-parole period is in my opinion the minimum that could be imposed for an offence as serious as this one.

…

[27] Matthew Allen Dennis, I sentence you to imprisonment for the murder of the child I have called J. I set a non-parole period of 20 years. It will be taken to have commenced on 17 April 2008 and will expire on 16 April 2028. You will become eligible for release to parole on that day. The balance of the term of the sentence will be six years and eight months, expiring on 16 December 2034.”

Submissions of the applicant


	
	Counsel for the applicant submitted that granting of an extension of time in which to seek leave to appeal was in the interests of justice. It was submitted that although there had been a delay in bringing the matter before the Court, that delay had been fully explained and that the reasons for it were, generally speaking, outside the applicant’s control. It was submitted that once the applicant had been informed of the possibility of his sentence being reviewed, he had acted swiftly and in accordance with the advice which had been provided to him by his legal representatives. It was also pointed out that further delay had been occasioned as a consequence of the need to await the decisions of the High Court in Kentwell and O’Grady and that this was not the result of any inaction on the part of the applicant. Generally speaking the Crown did not take issue with the proposition that the delay was adequately explained.
	
	
	In terms of the ground of appeal relied upon, it was submitted on behalf of the applicant that the sentencing judge had erred by:
	



	
	adopting a two stage approach to sentencing;
	
	
	approaching the sentencing exercise on the basis that prima facie, the standard non-parole period applied;
	
	
	giving determinative significance to the standard non-parole period; and
	
	
	failing to make proper allowance for the applicant’s youth and subjective case.
	



	
	Counsel submitted that paragraphs [22]-[27] of the sentencing remarks, and in particular paragraph [24], reflected the errors in (i), (ii) and (iii) above. He submitted, in particular, that the inference to be drawn was that his Honour had decided upon a non-parole period and, having done so, had then determined the balance of the term by a strictly mathematical process so that the non-parole period imposed equated to exactly 75 per cent of the head sentence. This it was submitted, reflected the adoption of a two stage approach to sentence, in which his Honour had given primary or perhaps determinative significance to the standard non-parole period. It was submitted that as a consequence of this approach, the non-parole period had “driven” the ultimate outcome.
	
	
	Counsel also relied upon the fact his Honour’s reasoning did not make reference to the standard non-parole period being a reference point or a guidepost, and that there was similarly no reference to the applicable maximum penalty. These matters, it was submitted, lent further support to the conclusion that the non-parole period had assumed determinative significance.
	


Submissions of the Crown


	
	Although the Crown accepted that the reasons for the delay were largely explained, it was submitted that no Muldrock error was made out and that accordingly, no extension of time ought be granted.
	
	
	It was submitted by the Crown that in determining whether or not a Muldrock error was made out it was necessary to view the sentencing remarks of the primary judge in their entirety, rather than focus attention on a discrete statement or statements which were suggested to be reflective of error.
	
	
	It was submitted that when this approach was adopted, it was clear that the sentencing judge did not treat the standard non-parole period in any determinative way and did not engage in a two stage approach of sentencing. Rather, it was submitted that the sentencing judge had engaged in a process of instinctive synthesis in which he took into account all relevant factors.
	


The application for extension of time


	
	The approach which is to be taken by the Court in determining whether or not to grant an extension of time is set out in Kentwell (supra) where the plurality (French CJ, Hayne, Bell and Keane JJ) said (commencing at [32]):
	


“…The discretionary power to extend the time limit is a legislative recognition that the interests of justice in a particular case may favour permitting an appeal or an application for leave to appeal to be heard, notwithstanding that it was not brought within time. The interests of justice will often pull in different directions. As earlier noted, they may include consideration of the adverse effect on the victim, or on the community generally, occasioned by re-opening a concluded criminal proceeding. However, at least in the case of an out-of-time challenge to a sentence that is being served, the principle of finality does not provide a discrete reason for refusing to exercise the power.

[33] Relevant to the determination of the interests of justice on an application to extend time is the prospect of success should the extension be granted. Contrary to the appellant’s submission, the Court of Criminal Appeal’s acceptance that his grounds of appeal were established did not conclude its consideration of the merits of the appeal. As the appellant acknowledged on the hearing of the appeal, notwithstanding conceded “Muldrock error”, a sentence may be so demonstrably lenient that the Court of Criminal Appeal concludes that there is no prospect that a lesser sentence would be imposed were the appeal to be entertained”.

The nature of Muldrock error


	
	In Muldrock (supra) the High Court concluded (at [25]) that the decision of this Court in R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; (2004) 60 NSWLR 168 was incorrect. In particular, the Court found that it was an error to characterise s. 54B(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 NSW (“the Sentencing Act”) as being framed in terms which required a sentencing judge to use the standard non-parole period as the starting point for an offence assessed as being in the middle of the range of objective seriousness.
	
	
	The Court further concluded (at [26]) that it was a mistake to give primary, let alone determinative, significance to the standard non-parole period. It was held that the correct approach was to identify all the factors relevant to sentence, including any prescribed standard non-parole period, and make a value judgment as to the appropriate sentence, given all such factors.
	
	
	In reaching those conclusions the Court (at [28]) specifically rejected the adoption of a two-stage approach to sentencing, commencing with an assessment of whether the offence fell in the middle of the range of objective seriousness, followed by an enquiry as to whether there were matters justifying a longer or shorter period.
	
	
	This Court has previously set out a number of general principles to be applied in approaching the question of whether or not a Muldrock error is made out in a particular case. In doing so, the Court has stressed the importance of considering the sentencing remarks as a whole. An approach which tends to parse such remarks, or which has, as its focus, an isolated passage or statement within such remarks, is erroneous: Black v R [2013] NSWCCA 265 at [41] per Bellew J, Hoeben CJ at CL and Johnson J agreeing, citing Essex v R [2013] NSWCCA 11 at [30] citing Aldous v R [2012] NSWCCA 153 at [2] and Zreika v R [2012] NSWCCA 44 at [43].
	


Consideration


	
	In my view, when the sentencing remarks in the present case are read as a whole it is apparent that his Honour took into account all relevant factors, both objective and subjective, which had a bearing on the determination of an appropriate sentence. Notwithstanding the absence of any reference to the standard non-parole period being a guidepost the sentencing remarks do not, in my view, indicate that his Honour regarded himself as being “tethered” to the standard non-parole period. This is particularly so in circumstances where his Honour found (at [23]) that the offending was “in about the middle range ….perhaps a little below it”.
	
	
	Similarly, in circumstances where the Crown had not sought the imposition of the maximum penalty, the absence of any express reference to that penalty by the sentencing judge is of no significance.
	
	
	In particular, I am unable to accept the submission made by counsel for the applicant that the sentencing remarks reflect his Honour having adopted a two stage process to sentencing, or having given primary or determinative significance to the standard non-parole period. The lengthy and detailed terms in which the sentencing judge dealt with all of the relevant considerations tends against the conclusion urged on behalf of the applicant, and reflects the sentencing judge having adopted a process of instinctive synthesis in which all relevant considerations were taken into account.
	
	
	Further, the submission that the non-parole period had “driven” the ultimate result was necessarily speculative. It relied upon reading into the sentencing remarks words which were simply not said by the sentencing judge. Moreover, paragraphs [23] and [24] of the sentencing remarks tend, in my view, against the conclusion urged by counsel for the applicant. In particular, those paragraphs reflect an approach in which his Honour determined the objective seriousness of the offending, against which he balanced the applicant’s subjective case.
	
	
	I am similarly unable to accept the submission that his Honour failed to make proper allowance for the applicant’s youth and subjective case. His Honour exhaustively considered all of the relevant subjective considerations (at [10]-[15]; [17]-[21]). He ultimately concluded (at [24]) that the applicant’s subjective features were “strong”. Those features included his prior good character, his “remarkable” work history and his reasonable prospects of rehabilitation. His Honour was obviously aware of the applicant’s youth (having referred to it specifically at [10], [13] and [14]). In expressing his conclusions about the applicant’s subjective case, his Honour concluded (at [24]) that the applicant’s young age assisted him. In my view it is clear that his Honour gave full consideration to all aspects of the applicant’s subjective case.
	


CONCLUSION


	
	It will be evident from the passages in Kentwell to which I earlier referred that one of the factors relevant to the determination of whether an extension of time should be granted is whether the proposed appeal has prospects of success. For the reasons above, the applicant’s complaint of error on the part of the sentencing judge cannot be made out.
	
	
	In these circumstances I propose the following order:
	



	
	The application for an extension time is refused.

		17 April 2015",2015-04-15 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2703617,R v KUO [2015] NSWDC 311,"Sentence


	
	HIS HONOUR: Ming Jen Kuo pleaded guilty to a charge on indictment alleging that he between 14 October 2013 and 12 November 2013 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales attempted to possess a substance being a border controlled drug, namely methamphetamine, a quantity to be possessed being a commercial quantity. I have summarised some of the verbiage of the original charge.
	
	
	This plea of guilty was entered by the prisoner after he had been committed for trial and after a trial date was fixed. It was indicated to the Court that a plea of guilty would be entered. According to my note as I do not have a transcript of last Thursday’s proceedings, approximately “a week before” the trial was to commence. As I understand it in due course the plea of guilty was entered on the date the trial was to commence.
	
	
	I have noted the careful written submissions of the Director of Public Prosecutions presented by his learned representative and the submissions of the accused in respect of the issue of a discount being given, if at all, to recognise the facilitation of the course of justice by the entering of a plea of guilty.
	
	
	I appreciate this is a discretionary matter and the Crown’s written submissions particularly set out a number of issues that have arisen in the consideration of this matter in sentencing for Commonwealth offences in New South Wales. There is in fact recent authority of the Court of Criminal Appeal which suggests that the strength of the Crown case may be more significant than the timing of the plea in this regard.
	
	
	Accepting all that has been put by the parties I have concluded that a discount of 12% should be given to the prisoner upon the otherwise appropriate sentence to recognise the facilitation of the course of justice by the plea of guilty.
	
	
	The offence to which the prisoner has pleaded guilty has a maximum penalty of life imprisonment and/or a fine of $1.275 million. There is no prospect of the prisoner being in a position to pay a fine. The quantity of the methamphetamine that was imported in pure weight was 3.10 kilograms. The substance that was imported had an average purity of approximately 78%. A commercial quantity of the border controlled drug methamphetamine I am informed is .75 kilograms.
	
	
	The prisoner is a citizen of Taiwan but had travelled to Australia from mainland China in circumstances I have outlined shortly. He was born on 21 December 1985 as I understand the matter. Thus he committed the subject offence when he was 27 years of age about to turn 28 and is now 29 years of age.
	
	
	The AFP inquiries reveal that he has no known prior criminal convictions. I am prepared to accept generally that he was a person of good character for that reason.
	
	
	There is a statement of facts. The bare telling of the story within that statement of facts is not in dispute. The real issue in this matter is whether or not the prisoner was acting under what is described in the authorities as non exculpatory duress, the topic discussed in a number of decisions, but particularly I refer to Tiknius v R [2011] NSWCCA 215 and the learned judgment, as usual, of his Honour Johnson J, particularly at [30]-[54].
	
	
	The prisoner gave evidence in relation to this matter and the evidence he gave, as well as the earlier history he had given to a psychologist, was very different from the version that he gave to the Australian Federal Police when spoken to on his arrest and then when subsequently interviewed, having regard to the material presented to me, summarised his representations in those interviews.
	
	
	Some of the submissions of the prosecution anticipating the factual issue in part to turn upon the truth of some of those representations made or admissions made to the Australian Federal Police operatives and officers.
	
	
	The prisoner arrived in Sydney from mainland China I am informed on 14 October 2013. He came here with a tourist visa that he had obtained in August 2013. As I understand the matter his visa was to expire in January the following year. He stayed two days in a hotel and then he moved into accommodation in the character of some former boarding house at 191 Stoney Creek Road Beverly Hills. This is in southern Sydney, not far from Hurstville.
	
	
	The consignment carrying the border controlled drugs, or if I might shortly call them the “drugs”, arrived in Sydney in early November 2013 addressed to the prisoner by name at the address that he had acquired at Beverly Hills after his arrival in Australia. I would safely assume that the details as to the consignor and other information concerning the origin of the consignment was false information.
	
	
	The consignment comprised, as I understand it, allegedly a number of tiles. The consignment when it came into Australia was x-rayed and ultimately after some anomalies were detected a white crystalline substance wrapped in plastic and carbon paper was found inside at least some of the tiles that form part of the consignment. I was not favoured with photographs of the consignment in its undeconstructed and then deconstructed state.
	
	
	In their usual efficient way the Customs Service and the Australian Federal Police examined the consignment and ultimately substituted for the methamphetamine an inert substance. The consignment with the inert substance was delivered to the address where the prisoner was present on 12 November 2013 in the very late morning.
	
	
	He signed for the consignment and had the consignment moved to a small, self-contained room at the rear of the premises. I am informed the consignment apparently remained unopened until the time that the police attended upon the premises approximately four and a half hours after the delivery to arrest the prisoner.
	
	
	The prisoner made admissions at the time that he was arrested as to his possession of the methamphetamine, but he said he was not planning to “on sell it”, an English translation no doubt of things that he said to the AFP, although he may have said that in English.
	
	
	He did know from these admissions to the AFP, which I accept to be true, that methamphetamine was within the consignment and he obviously was expecting it.
	
	
	In a later recorded interview he gave what I am satisfied was a false account of how the consignment came to be at his premises in Beverly Hills. He claimed that he had purchased two kilograms of methamphetamines from a person in China he had described as the “boss”. He sent that person his address at Beverly Hills and was given a tracking number for the consignment, which apparently he used to monitor the consignment’s progress. He said he was an amphetamine user. His history to the psychologist reveals he has only occasionally used amphetamines, if I might use that generic expression, and he was not a regular amphetamine user at the time of his arrest.
	
	
	He told the AFP officers that he had not used amphetamines since he arrived in Australia, but claimed in the interview that the methamphetamines were for his personal use which one might have thought was completely ridiculous given their value and the quantity.
	
	
	This account that he gave to the AFP, based upon a version that he has given in his evidence and through the psychologist’s report to some extent, was a manufactured account that he had been provided by the people that had recruited him in China if he was arrested when he was here in Australia.
	
	
	To my mind the account he gave to the AFP and his adoption of it as a version that he should give, given its preposterous character, reflects something of his naivety in relation to the situation in which he found himself here in Australia.
	
	
	As I said earlier the primary matter that arose in the evidence, particularly the oral evidence of the prisoner and which occupied a great deal of the submissions made, was whether the prisoner had committed the offence in consequence of what is described as non-exculpatory duress.
	
	
	It is submitted in detailed, but succinct written submissions from the counsel for the prisoner, that this would diminish or mitigate the moral culpability of the prisoner for his offending and I accept that if non exculpatory duress is made out, depending on the degree of it and of all the relevant circumstances this will mitigate the moral culpability of an offender and be relevant to the assessment of the objective seriousness of the offending.
	
	
	These matters are discussed as I said by Justice Johnson in the judgment which I earlier cited and he confirmed the existence of this matter as a relevant matter in sentencing under Commonwealth legislation, notwithstanding the absence of any reference to it in s 16A Crimes Act 1914. It goes without saying, of course as the Crown rightfully submits, that I am required to sentence the prisoner in accordance with the various provisions or relevant provisions of Pt 1B Crimes Act 1914 (CTH).
	
	
	Justice Johnson said, “It will be necessary for the sentencing judge to make factual findings as part of an assessment of whether this factor, that is non-exculpatory duress, assists the prisoner on sentence and if so to what extent?” He then dealt with the issue of the matters arising in that case. The defence of duress had been run at a trial which did not occur in this Court.
	
	
	He also analysed the character of non-exculpatory duress and he pointed out quite properly that there were a number of cases where an offender claims on sentence that his or her involvement in a drug importation or supply offence was a product of threats to self and family, with the threats sometimes coupled with the demand by those making the threats that involvement in the importation is required to discharge an existing debt. Whether an offender’s claim of this type is accepted he said depends, “of course on the facts of the particular case” [44].
	
	
	He said that speaking generally, sentencing courts were entitled to approach claims of this sort with a significant degree of circumspection. Claims can be easily made concerning the alleged conduct of persons in another country which is said to have applied pressure upon the offender. It has been said also that verification of a spurious claim of duress may prove difficult [45].
	
	
	His Honour pointed out that a careful and close assessment of evidence adduced to support such a claim should be made with the onus of proof upon the offender kept firmly in mind [47].
	
	
	He pointed out that even when non-exculpatory duress is made out general deterrence will still have a role to play. In fact it may be in a particular case where it has been made out by an accused that general deterrence will gave greater significance for the purpose of deterring others from succumbing to such threats that are alleged to be made and cited a number of authorities relative to that proposition.
	
	
	In my view the prisoner in this matter has not discharged the onus upon him to establish on balance that he acted under non-exculpatory duress.
	
	
	He gave an account, which in part I do accept, that he was in mainland China as a carer for a patient who came from Taiwan but went to China for some form of treatment.
	
	
	His history in the psychological report as an adult reflected upon the fact that he was, as I said earlier, an occasional drug user, but not addicted to any particular prohibited drug and was an occasional gambler, although not a heavy gambler. He reflected upon his mother who was widowed when the prisoner was a child being a person with problematic gambling habits. In fact as I understand the history he gave the psychologist she lost the family home to debt arising out of her gambling problems.
	
	
	When he was working in mainland China he became involved with what was described as “an underground casino”. He gambled heavily, he lost a lot of money and as I understand his account, from the evidence he gave last Thursday in the account he gave to the psychologist, he acquired a debt of 17,000 yuan, that is the Chinese national currency. He went back to pay back that money at the relevant place where that would occur, but instead of satisfying the debt he was presented with further IOUs indicating that he owed 60,000 yuan and was told that the only way he could assuage that debt would be to assist in the importation of border controlled drugs, particular methamphetamine.
	
	
	He said at one stage he was confronted by at least two men, one of whom threatened him with a knife and there were threats of a physical character made against him as well as threats to seek retribution against his mother in Taiwan if he did not agree to assist in the relevant enterprise of importing drugs into Australia.
	
	
	This was curious because, on his chronology of events, this proposal and these threats occurred many weeks after he had already decided to come to Australia and acquired his tourist visa. One wonders aloud how it was known that he was coming to Australia and how convenient it was that his presence in Australia on a purely innocent purpose coincided with the desire of people in China to have methamphetamine imported for him to “warehouse” in Australia as he ultimately did.
	
	
	He had already, as I would have understand, booked his ticket to Australia at the time of this threat and he did say in his evidence before me that he was inculpated in this importation after the decision had been made to come to Australia.
	
	
	He also gave evidence that he was told to make up a story if he was arrested about being a drug user and importing the drugs for his own use. As I pointed out earlier this he duly did and I have summarised the account that he gave to the Australian Federal Police.
	
	
	There are a number of unlikely aspects to his version. Whilst I accept it is possible that he had a gambling debt and that he sought to settle I do not accept that at that time he discovered that they were demanding more than he actually owed. I bear in mind of course that he was not a Chinese citizen, but was a Taiwanese citizen whose only reason for being on mainland China, or within the “People’s Republic of China”, was to act as a carer for a person. I note his version of events that he had actually resigned that position before he came to Australia and I take it before he was threatened, although that aspect of his account was not clear.
	
	
	I cannot see in the circumstances where he had no further connection to mainland China he would feel obligated to cooperate to the extent that he did, including after his arrival in Australia, tracking the movement of the consignment, beforehand providing the address that he had acquired in Sydney after he had left China and which could not have been known to those who recruited him at the time of his departure to Australia.
	
	
	He gave evidence that when endeavoured to pay back the 17,000 yuan debt and was confronted with the fresh IOUs for the greatly increased sum he was given back 10,000 yuan of his own money. I find this difficult to understand. In the circumstances of the matter this might have provided him with further reason not to cooperate once he had safely left Chinese shores.
	
	
	It seems to me that there is no rational basis, if he was not returning to China and there was no reason for him to do so as opposed to returning to Taiwan, to feel bound by any agreement with people with whom he had no other significant connection and was unlikely to meet again unless he chose to do so at some time in the future. Of course, they could always come to Australia to find him. But one might have thought that that might have been an expensive and somewhat futile exercise, particularly given that when he left China they obviously would not have had an address for him in Australia unless he provided it.
	
	
	To my view he, to all intents and purposes, was untraceable unless he provided relevant details to those who recruited him in China.
	
	
	He also said that he was concerned with threats made against his mother’s safety. I find it difficult to accept that even if threats were made he could take them seriously. His mother lived in Taiwan. There was ample opportunity for him to advise Taiwanese officials or have his mother advise Taiwanese officials of the threat and for steps taken for her protection. One does not have to be an expert on international relationships to understand that two very different political and law enforcement regimes exist within the two ‘states’. That is Taiwan and the People’s Republic of China. Threats from people living in the People’s Republic of China might seem to be hollow, bearing in mind I would expect, the restrictions upon travel from the People’s Republic of China by Chinese citizens to Taiwan.
	
	
	Of course these threats could be carried out through intermediaries. But in my view the prisoner gave no evidence to suggest that the people who recruited him had any capacity to do this or really to give any effect to the threats. The other aspect of the matter is how they would know how to find his mother unless he supplied details of her whereabouts.
	
	
	In any event turning back to the facts it is not to be forgotten that the prisoner was not a static recipient of the consignment containing the drugs where all the arrangements were made for him. He had made the relevant arrangements to receive the consignment at an address of his choosing under threats that he claimed had been made but which in a practical sense could not be immediately enforced against him.
	
	
	Even if he was threatened in some way when he was initially recruited, bearing in mind on his version he was already coming to Australia, all he had to do in my view was to break contact with his handlers on his arrival here.
	
	
	His account in his evidence in any event was at some material odds with the account he gave to the psychologist. I appreciate of course he may have previously instructed his legal representatives of the matters of which he gave evidence in this Court, but the first public occasion in which he gave an account appears in the psychologist’s report and in that account he made no mention of a man threatening him with a knife, which to my mind is a material inconsistency. His explanation for its absence in the history he gave the psychologist was unacceptable.
	
	
	I also bear in mind that the account he gave to the psychologist in general terms and the evidence in this sentencing proceeding was at odds with the account he gave when he was arrested. Although I accept that he gave an account when he was arrested, particularly in the recorded interview, to fit in with the story that had been fed to him by those who had employed him.
	
	
	As I pointed out from the decision of Tiknius, claims of non-exculpatory duress are to be approached by courts with care and usually with considerable circumspection. In this case that is justified given the prisoner’s failure to disclose relevant matters to this aspect of the case when he had the opportunity to do so when first arrested and really had nothing to lose. The fact that he had nothing lose is exemplified by the fact that he made relevant admissions against interests concerning his knowledge of the fact that methamphetamine had been imported and that he was in possession of the drugs, which I guess were self-evidently saved by the circumstances of his arrest.
	
	
	To be fair, the version he gave in the record of interview of having two kilograms of methamphetamine for his own use was so preposterous as I said earlier that it reflects to some extent upon his naivety and the fact that he was reciting some sort of learnt version that he had been tutored upon by others.
	
	
	I also point out, although it is not obviously decisive, that the prisoner was not a particularly impressive witness. Of course I have to make allowance for the fact that he was giving evidence with the aid of an interpreter and culturally he was at a considerable disadvantage giving evidence in this Court. I accept that he would not be used to giving evidence and certainly he was giving evidence in what could be best described as a foreign atmosphere and in very intimidating circumstances.
	
	
	Ultimately, however, he had no satisfactory response to the anomalies in his account in this Court that were exposed in the cross-examination of him by the Crown prosecutor.
	
	
	As I said earlier, I accept that he developed a gambling debt and that to satisfy that debt that contributed to his decision to involve himself in this matter. Even if he was initially reluctant he played a willing role facilitating the delivery.
	
	
	I could not conclude beyond reasonable doubt that his primary purpose to come to Australia was to warehouse the drugs though. The gap between his plan to come to Australia by obtaining tourist visa, his ultimate departure from China speaks of a plan to come here that predates any recruitment of him. Although I accept that it is possible that the obtaining of the tourist visa was solely to facilitate the obtaining of the drugs here in Australia that were sent in the manner in which these drugs were sent.
	
	
	He did say in his evidence that he was coming to Australia to find work. The Crown properly approached that matter with some cynicism given the character of his visa. But he would not be the first person to come from China or other places overseas armed only with a tourist visa whose real purpose was to endeavour to find some work in Australia. Of course his tourist visa was to expire in January. He may have considered staying beyond his tourist visa. It is to be borne in mind as is often pointed out in the media that far more illegal residents in Australia enter our country through the arrival lounges of airports than arrive in boats through South East Asia.
	
	
	In relation to his role in respect of this matter I considered everything that has been put by the learned Crown. I have pointed out of course some of the aspects of the Crown’s submissions were based upon the version the prisoner gave in his interview. It seems to me that the prisoner was a conduit for the drugs. I note in relation to this aspect of the matter that he supplied his own name and of course his own temporary residential address for the delivery of the consignment.
	
	
	He was exposed clearly, as subsequent events demonstrated by his arrest. I conclude that he involved himself in the commission of this offence for some financial benefit. It could well have been for the settlement of a drug debt. But this is not an uncommon circumstance with people involved in the importation of drugs in the manner in which this prisoner as involved or involved as couriers. He may have received other financial benefit, but not significant financial benefit. I note in relation to that aspect of the matter that he did not have a great deal of cash in his possession. There is no evidence of enrichment. It would seem his disinterest in the consignment may reflect of course his knowledge of the presence of a methamphetamine but also the fact that his task ultimately was to warehouse the drugs until people who would distribute them would take them from him.
	
	
	His counsel pointed out of course that his role was “crucial” in the particular sense in which it was performed and the Crown has put that submission to me as well. I could not conclude that the prisoner was the principal of this importation, amongst other reasons because of his self evidence exposure to detection. There is no evidence to support the proposition that his benefit was to be anything greater than modest.
	
	
	He adopted the detail of his background set out in the psychological report. Briefly put he has a younger brother who is four years his junior. His parents were people of modest means, his father was a tradesperson, his mother a street vendor. His father died of cancer when he was eight years of age and the family suffered a number of difficulties, financial and otherwise, although he had a reasonably happy relationship with his mother. He also had a great deal of her struggle through lack of financial support. He claimed some unhappiness in his childhood in his relationships with his peers. His mother’s gambling I have already referred to.
	
	
	He left home at 15. He has mainly had unskilled employment. His education is limited. It would appear that he associated with people that were perhaps “antisocial”, although not significantly so. The prisoner himself had no history according to the version he gave the psychologist of antisocial conduct or behaviour issues in school. He has generally been in employment and as I have pointed out he worked as a carer in the period leading up to his departure from China to come to Australia.
	
	
	Because of his lack of qualifications he is at a considerable disadvantage in his native country claiming “no bargaining power in the job market”. He has had several relationships over a period of time, one particular girlfriend being particularly demanding of his financial support. He has had no really significant injuries or ill-health. He had one head injury. There is no evidence of cognitive impairment, mental illness or intellectual disability.
	
	
	I have already dealt with his occasion use of “drugs” and his gambling up until the time he came to China.
	
	
	The psychological assessment of the prisoner reflected upon him being anxious and “depressed”, be active to his current circumstances. There is no evidence of mental illness relevant to the offending. There is no history of mental health treatment such as may be available in Taiwan or mainland China. His depressive symptoms were said to be “within the normal range” and he suffered obvious general psychological distress from his current incarceration having never been in custody and awaiting the outcome of the sentencing proceedings.
	
	
	There was a Depression Anxiety Stress Scale undertaken in the Chinese language. I have taken into account those conclusions. He had some psychological distress as a child, thoughts of self-harm and some obsessive compulsive disorder but none of that appears to be relevant to his offending or his current circumstances.
	
	
	The formulation of the psychologist reflects upon the matters I have identified, the lack of financial security as a child, difficulties with employment that was rewarding and ultimately the problematic gambling behaviour which contributed to his offending.
	
	
	The prisoner expressed remorse in his evidence in this Court and to the psychologist which I note. He does not have any “antisocial” attitudes on the testing of the psychologists such as lack of empathy, significant impulsivity or insensitivity to punishment. He lacks criminal history as I have already pointed out. It was suggested that he would have some difficulties in custody with his lack of English.
	
	
	He would benefit whilst in custody undertaking courses in relation to English and he may need a Mandarin speaking counsellor psychologist should his psychological state deteriorate in custody. He will suffer obvious isolation. His mother no doubt would have difficulty travelling to Australia, at least frequently, to support him. He would not have any other particular support in Australia. He is motivated to occupy himself in custody, but obviously will suffer those “hardships” that inevitably follow upon coming from a foreign country to commit a serious crime in our country.
	
	
	None of those aspects of the matter, whilst I take them into account, amount to exceptional circumstances. It is the fact that people who commit this type of crime, that is involvement in the importation of drugs, will find themselves isolated from their homeland to complete their sentences to varying degrees. He certainly does not have a wife or children who are depending upon him.
	
	
	By reference to the evidence of the prisoner I also note his observations about the effects of drugs upon other inmates whilst in custody in Australia, although I doubt that he was not aware of these matters from his experience in Taiwan and China to varying degrees. Particularly himself having used drugs, albeit occasionally.
	
	
	But I took his evidence on this matter before me to represent a reflection upon the significance of the crime that he committed, bearing in mind the drugs imported from China such as crystal methylamphetamine or methamphetamine, heroin and the like, or from other countries, are damaging to our community as recent public debate has emphasised. That public debate seems to be one that seems way behind the reality of what courts have been experiencing in the 15 years I have been a Judge and for many years before that.
	
	
	With regard to Pt 1B Commonwealth Crimes Act (1914) the learned Crown’s written submissions took me through matters pertinent to consideration of that part which obviously I have taken into account. There is nothing controversial in reality about the detail of the Crown’s written submissions and there are obvious self-evident truths. I am required to have regard to the maximum penalty as a yardstick and a basis for comparison between this case and a ‘worst case’ as it may be described citing the decision of Markarian. This aspect of the matter, admittedly in the context of sentencing under State law where an offence had a maximum penalty and a standard non-parole period, was recently the subject of discussion by Simpson J in her usual erudite way in the decision of R v Campbell [2014] NSWCCA 102, particularly at [27]-[29]. The matters that her Honour identified, albeit as I say in the context of State sentencing for an offence with a standard non-parole period, are pertinent to this aspect of the matter.
	
	
	I have reflected upon the analysis of matters required to be considered, under s 16A(2)(a), “the nature and circumstances of the offence”. The role of the prisoner as I said was to “warehouse”, perhaps for a relatively short time, the drugs, in the knowledge that they were drugs of a certain quantity. Although I accept he did not know how much was there. He certainly had a belief that there was at least two kilograms there and he actively assisted the importation.
	
	
	Of course he was not the importer. He did not organise the importation. He did not pay for the importation. He was not a courier who brought the drugs actually into the country but he had a “crucial” role to play and he was a link in a chain of distribution that would have ultimately but for the skill of the Customs Service and the skill of the Australian Federal Police led to the dissemination of these drugs into our community with the resultant damage.
	
	
	His role was not “menial or limited”, but he was very much at the lower level, perhaps at the lowest level of the relevant distribution network, although of course I do not have an organisation chart to assist me precisely identifying his position. This has been pointed out time and time again by courts of high authority, from Olbrich, the decision of the High Court of Australia, through to many decisions of the Court of Criminal Appeal.
	
	
	I accept the submission of the Crown of course that the amount of drugs are relevant, in fact a highly relevant factor in determining the objective seriousness of the offence. It is interesting, however, to note and comment upon that aspect of the matter given the range of quantity that the provision to which the prisoner has entered the plea of guilty contemplates. This is demonstrated in the comparative cases cited by the Crown which I have taken into account as well as the comparative cases cited by the accused in the schedule of cases in the written submissions.
	
	
	The crime obviously must have been committed for financial gain although there is no evidence to prove beyond reasonable doubt that it was a gain more than modest.
	
	
	I accept the Crown’s written submission and oral submission concerning the role of general deterrence clearly is a significant matter to have regard to.
	
	
	The Crown also made submissions about the guilty plea in accordance with s 16A(2)(g) the need for adequate punishment under (k) and, of course, the prisoner’s character antecedents and background which I have sought to summarise from the available material.
	
	
	I have already dealt with the issue of non-exculpatory duress as identified by the Crown.
	
	
	By reference to s 16A(2) I take into account that there are no other offences required to be taken into account. Even though the Crown submitted that the prisoner’s sole purpose was to be here for the reception of this consignment and that raises of course the possibility of further consignments to come I could not conclude that this offence forms part of a course of conduct consisting of a series of criminal acts of the same or similar character (s 16A(2)(c)).
	
	
	Due to the skill of the AFP and the Customs officials as I have said there was no victim of this crime, there was no loss or damage, although of course there was great potential.
	
	
	The prisoner has expressed contrition and has indicated he now recognises the harm that drugs do and I note that, I take that into account, but it is not significant contrition that is both timely and complete. I note the fact that I am required to take into account the deterrent effect that any sentence will have upon the prisoner and to ensure he is adequately punished I am also required to take into account his prospects of rehabilitation (s 16A(2)(n)).
	
	
	I am required also to take into account the probable effect that any sentence will have upon his family (s 16A(2)(p)). His mother may be categorised as a dependent, but I do not conclude that she is solely dependent upon the prisoner. Ultimately of course the situation is not one that invites a finding of exceptional circumstances that would warrant any substantial mitigation and penalty.
	
	
	The prisoner is the architect of his own misfortunate ultimately. Whatever initial persuasion was placed upon him, his mother it would seem has been living independently of him even though he has provided some financial support over the years.
	
	
	With regard to the oral and written submissions of the prisoner, as I said, the bulk of those submissions were directed at an issue I have resolved.
	
	
	I have taken into account the various subjective circumstances that are summarised helpfully in the written submissions, the plea of guilty, the absence of criminal history. I accept that he has good prospects of rehabilitation. One of reasons the prisoner obviously was recruited was because he was a person of good character with no prior criminal convictions. There is no point walking through the terminals of Sydney Airport with convictions for drug supply overseas, or the like, that would only attract attention. It should be understood that, as is often pointed out sometimes in the consideration of sentencing for offences of this type, good character is of lesser value, particularly in the circumstances where people are recruited or agree to perform these crimes because they are of good character and would hope to escape detection by reason of the fact that they have no prior criminal convictions. That is why those people are used. But I accept ultimately that his absence of criminal history, his past work history, the largely pro social life that he has, no conclusive evidence of his involvement in a criminal subculture other than his connection with the people in China that recruited him, reflect a risk of further offending.
	
	
	His use to other cartels or organisations is no longer viable given this conviction and the inevitable term of imprisonment.
	
	
	I note the circumstances in which he must serve his custodial sentence, I bear that in mind and the difficulties he will have with his lack of English. His English will be much improved I expect by the time he finishes his non-parole period but these are matters he brought upon himself.
	
	
	There was suggested in passing without much conviction, if I may use that term without seeking to make a joke of it, that there was an element of extra curial punishment at work here. I note the prisoner was attended by people purporting to be representatives of the Taiwanese government. The prisoner has been told that he may be subject to sanction when he returns to Taiwan. I have no evidence about this of any worth. I do not mean that critically of the way the case is presented, but the truth is I have no details of what further punishment or penalty will await him or what further prosecution may be launched against him on his return to Taiwan. It may be that the State of Taiwan seek to exercise some extra territorial jurisdiction in relation to such offending. In the absence of any coherent or cogent evidence all I can do other than acknowledge the possibility that he may be subject to sanction on his return to Taiwan, but for what I cannot identify. I have not been given any assistance whatsoever as to Taiwanese law or the probabilities or otherwise of such an event occurring. If such event occurs. Whether it has any connection with this matter or other matters I do not know and I believe ultimately that that was conceded in the way the case was conducted.
	
	
	I have had regard to the comparative cases. Of course, I appreciate as the Court of Criminal Appeal recently said in the decision of RCW (2) “A judge sentencing at first instance should not become fixated on any particular so called “comparative case.” I do not propose to recite all the decisions at first instance and on appeal that have been referred to by both the Crown and defence but I have read both the summaries and the judgments that were helpfully provided, particularly, the judgment provided in full by the Crown.
	
	
	I have had particular regard to DPP v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194 in the judgment of the then Chief Judge at Common Law McClelland J and particularly [193] - [224]. His Honour sought after an exhaustive summary of sentencing of offenders for importation of border controlled drugs, particularly cocaine as was the case in De La Rosa, to categorise different levels of culpability in the manner that is set out, for example, in the table at [224]. It is not for me in my humble position to “criticise” his Honour. I do not. But it might fairly be said that his categories might not be seen to be exhaustive. There appear many overlaps between some of the categories that he identifies, the role of people and the consideration of the quantities of the drugs involved.
	
	
	I appreciate this prisoner is not a “courier”, but in terms of his position within the distribution structure I see his position as “analogous to that of a courier”. In terms of such assistance comparative sentences may provide, bearing in mind variations in discount for pleas of guilty, cooperation and the like, it seemed to me that the purported “fourth category” which his Honour refers to at [214] - [215] is more similar to the situation here than other categories he identifies. But as I say, his categorisation cannot, in the context of my experience of dealing with a range of importers over the years, reflect all relevant computations of offending.
	
	
	I have been provided with some statistics by the defence which have their limitations that are the subject of discussion by Chief Justice Spigelman in the decision of Butterfield in 1998 but I take those statistical figures from a relatively small sample surprising of 24 cases to show a range of penalty bearing in mind the absence of key information as to the discount for the plea of guilty, the quantity of the drugs, the role of the prisoner and the like.
	
	
	As the Crown correctly pointed out in its submissions I am required under Pt 1B to impose a sentence of imprisonment, no other penalty is appropriate. I have determined a sentence of imprisonment that will require the fixing of a single non-parole period in assessing the non-parole period. I have had regard to the decision of the High Court, particularly, of Hili v The Queen and Jones v The Queen [2010] HCA 45 and the relevant principles to the assessment of fixing the non-parole period or minimum period. I am required to backdate the sentence to the date that the prisoner came into custody as a matter of fairness to him.
	
	
	Thus, having taken all relevant matters into account, if you could stand up please, Mr Kuo, in respect of the offence to which you ultimately pleaded guilty you are convicted.
	
	
	You are sentenced to a term of imprisonment of seven years. That sentence will commence on 12 November 2013 and will expire on 11 November 2020. In respect of that sentence, I fix a non-parole period of four years to date from 12 November 2013 to expire on 11 November 2017 on which date, subject to s 19AL Crimes Act 1914, you will be released to parole should that decision meet the favour of the Parole Authority. When you are released to parole you almost certainly will be taken into Commonwealth custody and I would expect be deported from Australia back to your country of origin, that is, Taiwan. It will be a matter for the Parole Authority, in consultation with the Commonwealth, as to whether you should be released to parole at the expiry of the non-parole period, it may not be an automatic release. You can take a seat, thank you.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Mr Crown, are there any technical matters from you?
	
	
	WHITEMAN: No, I don’t think there is, your Honour.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Any matters from you, sir?
	
	
	SAUNDERS: No, your Honour.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Thank you. Do you understand the sentence that has been imposed?
	
	
	OFFENDER: Yes, your Honour.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Yes, thank you, you are excused. Thank you, Mr Interpreter, very much for your assistance. Thank you, Mr Crown, and will you pass on my thanks to the learned counsel and again, Mr Saunders, the attention of learned counsel for the assistance you gave and thank you to the court staff.

The grounds of appeal


	
	The grounds of appeal in respect of which leave was sought were:
	



	
	The sentencing judge erred in placing undue weight upon the applicant’s status in Australia as an illegal immigrant.
	
	
	The sentencing judge failed to give appropriate weight to the applicant’s plea of guilty.
	
	
	The sentence was manifestly excessive.
	



	
	At the conclusion of the hearing before this Court on 8 April 2015, the Court was satisfied that the second and third grounds had been made out. Accordingly it made the following orders:
	



	
	Leave to appeal granted and appeal allowed.
	
	
	Quash the sentence imposed in the District Court on 6 March 2014 and in lieu thereof, taking into account the offences listed on the Form 1, sentence the offender to imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 1 year 6 months with a balance of the term of the sentence of 1 year 1 month.
	
	
	The sentence is to date from 18 July 2013.
	
	
	The offender became entitled to release on parole upon the expiration of the non-parole period on 17 January 2015.
	



	
	My reasons for the orders are as follows.
	


Facts


	
	The following narrative is derived from the Agreed Facts which formed the basis of the plea and were tendered on sentence and admissions made to the Community Corrections Officer who prepared the pre-sentence report.
	
	
	In 2009 the applicant, who was Malaysian, travelled to Australia and overstayed his visa. He was deported to Malaysia in 2011. He changed his name and obtained a new passport, which he used to return to Australia in April 2012 on a 3-month visa. He also overstayed this visa.
	
	
	From about June 2013 the applicant lived and worked in a four-bedroom brick veneer house in Epping which had been wholly converted, save for the rear living room and kitchen, for the purpose of growing cannabis plants. The applicant knew the work to be illegal but he undertook it in order to obtain a ticket back to Malaysia, which he could not otherwise afford.
	
	
	When police conducted covert surveillance they saw the applicant come and go from the house over a two-day period. At 7.20am on 18 July 2013 police executed a search warrant and forced entry to the premises. The applicant was lying on a single bed in the rear living room. A plastic clip lock bag containing 833g of cannabis leaf was found beside his bed. This was the subject of the supply charge that was taken into account on the Form 1 pursuant to s 32 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW). Four rooms in the house were set up with light shades, light globes and black pots in which 135 cannabis plants, at various stages of maturity with heights from 45cm to 1m, grew. An irrigation system had been constructed. There were three power boards and 82 transformers in the roof cavity above one of the rooms. The electricity had been bypassed from the grid and the power supply was being used to power the lights, fans and transformers which were being used in the cultivation of cannabis. This was the subject of the unauthorised use of electricity charge which was also taken into account on the Form 1.
	
	
	The applicant was taken to Ryde Police Station, cautioned and interviewed with the assistance of an interpreter. He told police that the house was already set up when he arrived and that he was paid $200 per week to live there and mix fertiliser into the water for the plants. He had been living there for several weeks and had received $600-$800.
	


The sentence hearing


	
	At the sentence hearing the Crown tendered documents which included: the Court Attendance Notices; a signed Form 1; a statement of Agreed Facts; a criminal history; a custodial history and a pre-sentence report. Mr Jones, who appeared on behalf of the applicant, handed up Judicial Commission sentencing statistics for offences contrary to s 23 of the DMTA.
	
	
	Mr Jones submitted that the applicant’s plea of guilty had been entered at the first available opportunity. The Crown specifically conceded in reply:
	


“We agree he should receive the maximum benefit for his earliest plea, it was indicated upon arrest of the utilitarian value of the plea [sic]. . ..”


	
	Mr Jones submitted that the sentencing judge should accept from the immediate admissions he made to the police that the applicant was remorseful. He also relied on the applicant’s lack of criminal history. Mr Jones submitted that the applicant had very limited education and that he was exposed to exploitation by reason of his limited education and financial difficulties. Mr Jones also contended that a finding of special circumstances was appropriate having regard to the fact that the applicant spoke very little English and would be unable to gain access to rehabilitation services in custody. Moreover, he had neither friends nor family in Australia who could visit him in gaol.
	


The remarks on sentence


	
	The sentencing judge prefaced the remarks on sentence with the following observation:
	


“It now seems relatively commonplace for uneducated Asians illegally in Australia to be approached by those involved in what must be fairly large scale cannabis supply, to look after their hydroponic cannabis growing operations.”


	
	His Honour narrated the facts which are set out above. His Honour referred to the applicant’s deportation following his first trip to Australia and the circumstance that he had changed his name and returned. The sentencing judge found that the applicant “appears to have been simply a labourer who looked after the plants and received money and the promise of an air ticket in return”.
	
	
	His Honour addressed the questions of remorse and the plea of guilty together in the following way:
	


“The offender appears willing to take the blame for his misconduct without assisting the authorities to identify anyone else involved. He, of course, is not to be punished for this but questions of remorse have to be examined in the light of the attitude expressed by the offender. There is no real evidence of remorse. The plea of guilty was a recognition of the inevitable; he was found sleeping in the premises. There is no evidence that he regrets his actions apart of course from being disappointed at being arrested and sent to gaol.”


	
	His Honour accepted that there were special circumstances on the basis of the applicant’s poor English skills but said that “there will only be a relatively small adjustment from the statutory ratio”.
	
	
	The sentence of three and a half years with a non-parole period of two years gives rise to a ratio between the non-parole period and the head sentence of 57%.
	


The appeal

Ground 1: placing too much weight on the applicant’s status as an illegal immigrant


	
	Mr Hunt, who appeared on behalf of the applicant in this Court, contended that the sentencing judge had placed too much weight on the applicant’s status as an illegal immigrant in circumstances where the applicant’s conduct, although illegal, had not been the subject of a charge. Mr Hunt submitted that, while these matters were relevant as background and served to explain the economic imperative which inclined the applicant to undertake work which he knew to be illegal, they were insufficient to outweigh the applicant’s lack of convictions and early guilty plea.
	
	
	There are difficulties in making out this ground, not least because one cannot discern from the sentence precisely what weight was given to which of the many factors which his Honour took into account when sentencing the applicant. Moreover, the sentencing discretion is a matter of instinctive synthesis and not mathematics: Veen v The Queen (No. 2) [1988] HCA 14; 164 CLR 465 at 476; Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at [39].
	
	
	Although the sentencing judge’s prefatory remark about the prevalence of the type of offending in which the applicant was engaged among illegal immigrants with limited English may suggest that his Honour was particularly focussed on this circumstance, I did not consider that a fair reading of the remarks on sentence bore this out. Nor did I consider it reasonable to infer that the length of the sentence imposed could be accounted for by reason of the weight the sentencing judge gave to the applicant’s status in Australia as an illegal immigrant.
	
	
	I was not persuaded that the first ground had been made out.
	


Ground 2: the sentencing judge failed to give appropriate weight to the applicant’s plea of guilty


	
	Mr Hunt contended that the inference was open that the sentencing judge had not applied the maximum discount (of 25%), which was accepted by the Crown to be appropriate, when imposing the sentence. In support of this submission Mr Hunt relied on the fact that, although the plea of guilty was referred to in the remarks on sentence, his Honour did not expressly quantify the percentage discount. Further, Mr Hunt submitted that, if the 25% had been applied, the starting point for the sentence was four years and eight months, which was excessive having regard to his Honour’s findings as to the applicant’s limited involvement.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that this Court could infer that the sentence imposed had been discounted to take account of the utilitarian value of the plea. The Crown relied on the brevity of the sentence hearing. It was accepted by Mr Hunt that the sentencing hearing, including the oral delivery of reasons, would have taken no more than half an hour. Accordingly, the submissions made by counsel as to the early plea and the appropriate discount would have been fresh in the sentencing judge’s memory when his Honour delivered the remarks on sentence. The Crown distinguished the present case from cases such as Convery v R [2014] NSWCCA 93 at [28]-[30] where the only available inference was that the discount had not been applied as the undiscounted sentence exceeded the maximum sentence. The Crown submitted that there was nothing about the mathematics of the sentence to indicate that the discount had not been applied because it could safely be inferred that the starting point was either four years and eight months (if a 25% discount were allowed) or four years and five months (if a 20% discount were allowed).
	
	
	The sentencing judge is a very experienced judge and can be taken to be familiar with all relevant principles of sentencing and the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. This Court ought not, in my view, lightly infer that a task which is undertaken regularly and under significant time pressure has been undertaken with such obvious omission as to fail to apply a discount for a plea of guilty, the magnitude of which, 25%, was not controversial.
	
	
	Nonetheless, I was persuaded by Mr Hunt’s submissions that this occurred in the instant case and served to explain the length of the sentence imposed on the applicant, which I regarded as manifestly excessive. That the sentencing judge referred to the plea of guilty in the context of remorse, but not in the context of its utilitarian value, provided some indication that its significance in the latter context may have been overlooked. Whether a plea of guilty indicates remorse depends on many factors. For example, if an offender, as in the present case, has been caught “red-handed”, it may be that no inference that he or she is remorseful can be drawn from the plea.
	
	
	However, the purpose of s 22 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act is to be distinguished from the purpose of s 21A(3)(i). Section 22 provides:
	


“22 Guilty plea to be taken into account

(1) In passing sentence for an offence on an offender who has pleaded guilty to the offence, a court must take into account:

(a) the fact that the offender has pleaded guilty, and

(b) when the offender pleaded guilty or indicated an intention to plead guilty, and

(c) the circumstances in which the offender indicated an intention to plead guilty,

and may accordingly impose a lesser penalty than it would otherwise have imposed.

(1A) A lesser penalty imposed under this section must not be unreasonably disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of the offence.

(2) When passing sentence on such an offender, a court that does not impose a lesser penalty under this section must indicate to the offender, and make a record of, its reasons for not doing so.

(3) Subsection (2) does not limit any other requirement that a court has, apart from that subsection, to record the reasons for its decisions.

(4) The failure of a court to comply with this section does not invalidate any sentence imposed by the court.”


	
	The remorse shown by the offender (which may be indicated by a plea of guilty, particularly an early one where the evidence against the offender is not strong) is a mitigating factor to be taken into account in the offender’s favour under s 21A(3)(i). However, the purpose of s 22, which requires the court, when passing sentence, to take into account the fact of the plea, its timing and the circumstances in which the offender indicated an intention to plead, is utilitarian. The strength of the Crown case, while relevant to remorse, is irrelevant to its utilitarian value in the context of s 22: R v Sutton [2004] NSWCCA 225 at [11]-[12] per Howie J, Studdert and Dunford JJ agreeing. The Parliamentary intention behind s 22 (which was regarded as confirming the court’s existing practice) is evident from the following passage of the Second Reading Speech to the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Amendment Bill 2010 (NSW) (Parliamentary Debates, Legislative Council, 23 November 2010, page 27866):
	


“Clearly, the earlier a plea is entered, the greater are the savings for the justice system. Consistent with current case law, an explanation of the circumstances of a late plea may not result in any significant discount because the timing was so late that no utilitarian value was derived from it.”


	
	This Court said in its guideline judgment in respect of discounts for pleas of guilty, R v Thomson; R v Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309; 49 NSWLR 383 that: a sentencing judge should explicitly state that a plea of guilty has been taken into account; sentencing judges are encouraged to quantify the effect of the discount for the plea (although failure to do so does not vitiate the sentence if it is otherwise clear that it has been taken into account); and the percentage discount is referable to the timing of the plea, which affects its utilitarian value.
	
	
	In the present case the sentencing judge neither quantified the discount for the plea; nor said that it had been taken into account. The only reference to the plea in the remarks on sentence was in connection with the issue of remorse. I did not regard the present case as one in which it can be safely inferred that a sentencing judge has applied an unstated (but not disputed) discount (cf. R v Lawrence [2005] NSWCCA 91 at [13]- [15] per Spigelman CJ; Devine v R [2009] NSWCCA 261 per Fullerton J). Indeed the absence of a relevant mention and the magnitude of the sentence imposed were sufficient to satisfy me that no discount was applied. I was persuaded that this ground has been made out.
	


Ground 3: manifest excess


	
	The statistics that were provided to his Honour were also relied upon by Mr Hunt in this Court. Although the facts and circumstances of individual cases cannot usefully be discerned from the statistics, the latter may provide a useful indication of past sentencing practices. The sentence imposed by his Honour (if the discount had been taken into account) would appear to be at odds with the sentencing practices disclosed by those statistics.
	
	
	I regarded the length of the sentence imposed to be both exorbitant and inconsistent with his Honour’s careful findings about the limited extent of the applicant’s involvement in the cultivation. The applicant was found, in substance, to be no more than a gardener and lodger who had been used as a pawn by those who stood to profit from the venture. His continuous presence in the house exposed him to a substantial risk of detection, which was not commensurate with the meagre income he received for his efforts. His limited English, his immigration status and his parlous financial circumstances made him prey to such exploitation.
	
	
	It is generally appropriate, where a sentence is found to be manifestly excessive, to preserve the sentencing judge’s findings and structure in so far as they have not been the subject of challenge on appeal. I had some reservations about whether his Honour intended to adjust the ratio between the non-parole period and the total term from the statutory ratio of 75% to 57% since his Honour said that there would “only be a relatively small adjustment from the statutory ratio”; however, I considered that this aspect of his Honour’s decision ought not be disturbed, no challenge having been made to it.
	
	
	In my view, the sentence imposed by his Honour needed to be discounted by 25% to rectify the error found with respect to the second ground. Mr Hunt did not wish to be heard against this approach. Nor did the Crown submit that this was not an appropriate way of re-sentencing the applicant, if the Court was persuaded that the second and third grounds had been made out.
	
	
	This produced the effect, as appears from the orders set out above, of reducing the head sentence from three years and six months to two years and seven months and reducing the non-parole period from two years to one year and six months.

2703626,Coles Supermarkets Australia Pty Ltd v Fardous [2015] NSWCA 82,"Judgment


	
	MACFARLAN JA: On 10 July 2010 Mr Abrahim Fardous, the respondent, slipped and fell at the appellant’s supermarket at Burwood. He injured his back and sued the appellant for damages for negligence. Following a hearing in the District Court before Sorby DCJ, his Honour found in Mr Foudous’ favour on liability and awarded him damages (as later adjusted) of $354,965.
	
	
	The appellant does not challenge the liability finding but appeals against the adjusted awards of $79,600 for past economic loss, $219,640 for future economic loss and $25,725 for future out-of-pocket expenses. On appeal the parties accepted that the accident at the appellant’s supermarket destroyed any earning capacity that Mr Fardous then had. The principal question raised by the appeal is whether Mr Fardous had any earning capacity at that time, taking into account an earlier work accident that occurred in September 2007.
	


THE SEQUENCE OF EVENTS AND MEDICAL OPINIONS


	
	Mr Fardous was born in Lebanon in 1966 and migrated to Australia with his family in 1976. He left school after year 10 and was employed for 11 years as a machine operator at HBA Book Binding. He commenced employment with Graphic Book Binding in 1999 and on 27 September 2007 he was injured in the course of his employment with that company. As a result, Mr Fardous suffered severe lower back pain, extending into his left leg, and was admitted to hospital for five days. After examining CT and MRI scans, Dr Mark Davies, a neurosurgeon and spinal surgeon, concluded that Mr Fardous had an L3/4 spinal injury that warranted surgery (Report, 28 December 2012, p 1).
	
	
	Dr Davies performed the surgery on 31 January 2008 and advised Mr Fardous that he should return for a consultation in August 2008 and “that if a job was available for him he would be fit to return to work on restricted duties” (ibid, p 2).
	
	
	On 6 August 2008 Dr James Bodel, an orthopaedic surgeon engaged by Graphic Book Binding’s insurer, examined Mr Fardous. Dr Bodel recorded that Mr Fardous “state[d] that unfortunately after the surgery was done on 31 January 2008 there ha[d] been minimal improvement” and that he had ongoing lower back pain and stiffness, as well as listing five different medications as proposed or current treatment for Mr Fardous (Report, 6 August 2008, pp 2, 3). Dr Bodel concluded that Mr Fardous “remains unfit for all work” and that further surgery might be necessary depending on the outcome of a forthcoming examination by Dr Davies (ibid, pp 4, 5).
	
	
	Dr Davies’ report of 28 December 2012 includes the following in relation to his consultation with Mr Fardous on 18 August 2008:
	


“I explained to him, even if he has pain in the leg, he was not necessarily causing any damage. He should attempt to return to work on graduated return to work programme on restricted duties in the following months. I suggested it may be difficult to know whether he can work, unless he tries. He was probably not fit to return to his normal duties at that stage. I also suggested a left L3 nerve root block but he was certainly not keen on having this procedure. A last resort with perhaps only a 60% chance of helping his pain was an L3/4 fusion. I was certainly not advocating this but this is something that could have been left in reserve as a last resort. I took the liberty of referring him to Dr David Gorman for a pain management program” (p 2).


	
	Mr Fardous met with Dr Gorman on 4 September 2008.
	
	
	On 17 June 2009 Dr John Davis, a consultant in occupational medicine, reported, for the purposes of a workers’ compensation claim by Mr Fardous against his employer, on his assessment of Mr Fardous the previous day. Dr Davis noted that Mr Fardous had a continuing complaint of constant lower back pain but was “not at all keen to undergo any further [surgical] procedure at this time” (Report, 17 June 2009, p 3). Notwithstanding Mr Fardous’ reluctance, Dr Davis was of the view that Mr Fardous would eventually have to “succumb” to further surgery. He said that Mr Fardous was no longer able to undertake work which involved lifting more than five kilograms and that Mr Fardous was permanently unfit to return to his pre-injury work. He concluded:
	


“Mr Fardous has no appropriate transferable skills, and given his level of ongoing pain, likely requirement for further operative intervention and required restrictions it is more likely than not that in fact he will not find further formalised employment on the open labour market. Should he be sufficiently motivated and fortunate enough to obtain some form of suitable employment, then I believe that his maximal work capacity in any situation would be to 15 hours per week. There would however have to be considerable reduction in his symptom intensity prior to consideration of any formalised employment” (Report, 17 June 2009, p 5).


	
	On 24 September 2009 Dr Con Kafataris, a corporate medical consultant engaged by Mr Fardous’ employer’s insurer, reported on his assessment of Mr Fardous. Dr Kafataris reported that Mr Fardous said that his surgery in January 2008 “gave him no improvement in his symptoms not even temporary improvement in his leg pain” (Report, 24 September 2009, p 1). Dr Kafataris noted:
	


“He has been cleared for suitable duties at 12 hours a week for sometime, however he has not found any work. Apparently, further surgery has been discussed but the worker is not keen on this.

He continues to complain of persistent left sided lumbar pain with pain radiating to his left thigh, calf and left foot. There has been no substantial change in his symptoms over the past 12 months. There is paraesthesia over the lateral aspect of the left foot. Solicitors are involved in his case” (ibid, p 2).


	
	Dr Kafataris concluded as follows:
	


“Treatment

The worker has attempted the full gamut of interventions for work related low back pain including physiotherapy, a home exercise program and a pain clinic. None of these have been particularly effective in improving the worker’s functional capacity.

It appears however that the worker has been less than diligent in applying functional restoration techniques taught to him and this may at least partially explain the failure of these interventions to achieve an improvement.

Fitness for Work

I can see no reason why the worker could not increase his hours of work. He has been certified fit for 12 hours a week for some time however his chances of finding work at this level is relatively poor. I therefore recommend that his hours be upgraded to four hours a day, five days a week to improve the chances of obtaining a work trial. Similar restrictions could apply as do currently, i.e., to avoid prolonged static postures, change position at least every 30 minutes, avoid repeated flexion and rotation and a lifting limit of 5kg should apply.

Essentially the only way forward for this worker is for him to focus on improving levels of functional capacity via progressive increases in activity over a period of time and using CBT principles to manage the inevitable exacerbations that will occur with each increase.

Accordingly, when he returns to work, he will need to maintain his hours for at least four weeks probably six weeks, before any upgrades can be looked at, as there will most likely be an exacerbation in his symptoms over this period of time. If he is able to remain at work and negotiate his way through this exacerbation, then the long-term prognosis will be much more favourable.

The best possible scenario for this worker will be a full shift of permanently modified duties. I would suggest that he may require between 12 and 20 weeks to move from 20 hours a week to 40 hours a week. At that point, a permanently modified duties certificate could be looked at” (ibid, pp 4-5).


	
	On 3 November 2009 Mr Fardous commenced proceedings in the District Court claiming damages from his employer. His Statement of Particulars asserted that as a consequence of the injuries that he sustained in the 2007 accident Mr Fardous “has not been able to return to work and given the extent of the pathology in his back, he is unlikely to ever return to work in any meaningful capacity” and that he “is effectively totally incapacitated for employment” (p 3).
	
	
	On 17 December 2009 Mr Fardous attended Dr Nasr Ismail, a general practitioner practising at the Al Zahra Medical Centre. Dr Ismail noted that “Mr Fardous continued to complain about back pain and left leg numbness and loss of left knee reflexes” and that his involvement in an expensive and comprehensive pain management program had not reduced his pain or improved his quality of life (Report, 17 December 2009, p 1). Dr Ismail considered that helping Mr Fardous to obtain employment depended on improving his pain management which would in turn help to solve “his psychological trauma and improve physical activity” (ibid). Dr Ismail concluded that if Mr Fardous’ ability to work was reassessed as up to 20 hours per week:
	


“… the main issue of upgrading Mr Fardous medical condition is bound by first better control of pain management. I recommend review pain control by Dr. Gourmin so we can get pain control improvement. Secondly, find a suitable job to help to test Mr Fardous ability and pain control so he can be physically and psychologically in a better mood then we can increase hours and lift the restriction on his medical certificate” (ibid, p 2).


	
	On 19 March 2010 Mr Fardous’ proceedings against his employer were settled, with judgment to be entered in his favour in the sum of $365,000.
	
	
	In a report dated 3 November 2010 Dr Ismail recorded the following in relation to a consultation with Mr Fardous on 26 March 2010:
	


“After surgery his symptoms and pain continued to improve, he visited me on the 26/03/2010 happy and comfortable with the results saying his pain is improving significantly and his need for analgesia” (p 1).


	
	In his report dated 28 December 2012 Dr Davies noted that he had not seen Mr Fardous after 16 August 2008 but that he was “assured by him, and the suggestion is from his GP, that he continued to improve and in the end had little pain” (Report, p 3).
	
	
	The accident at the appellant’s premises occurred on 10 July 2010.
	
	
	Mr Fardous gave evidence that prior to the July 2010 accident he had attempted to obtain work but had been unsuccessful (transcript pp 6, 26). In February/March 2011 he undertook a course to obtain a qualification as a security guard. He obtained the relevant certificate in November 2011 but was unable to obtain security work (or any other type of job).
	


THE JUDGMENT AT FIRST INSTANCE


	
	After reviewing the evidence, the primary judge found the following in relation to Mr Fardous’ condition prior to his July 2010 accident:
	


“36. I accept that there was improvement in the Plaintiff’s symptoms as at the time he saw Dr Ismail on 26 March 2010, but also the Plaintiff still had pain and discomfort in his back and left leg”.


	
	In relation to out-of-pocket expenses, his Honour noted that there was an overlap between the medication and treatment taken and received as a result of the two accidents (Judgment [42]). His Honour took that into account in his award for past and future expenses (Judgment [43]).
	
	
	His Honour also awarded Mr Fardous $13,000 to cover the possibility that he would need an operation in the future to deal with the injury he suffered in the July 2010 accident (Judgment [46]).
	
	
	His Honour awarded Mr Fardous damages for past economic loss on the basis that his earning capacity before the July 2010 accident was 20 hours per week at $20 per hour and that this had been lost. His Honour erroneously recorded that Mr Fardous had obtained a “security license” prior to the July 2010 accident (at [54]). His Honour found that, but for that accident, Mr Fardous could have utilised the license to obtain work “in a sedentary position” as a security guard at $20 per hour.
	
	
	His Honour also said:
	


“52. Whilst his general practitioner Dr Ismail noted ‘improvement’ in the Plaintiff’s back pain prior to his fall, no specialist is of the opinion that the Plaintiff was fit for his old industrial job or other work at that time”.

As to future economic loss, his Honour concluded:

“59. I accept that the Plaintiff would like to be gainfully employed, to his credit and is applying for work online [sic]. But the medical evidence, largely contradicts his assessment as to his capacity for work. However, as submitted by Mr Ward, he is capable of 20 hours a week at $20.00 per hour in a light sedentary type job. These figures take into account the previous industrial injury. The plaintiff intended to work until the age of 67. I therefore award him the sum of $228,000 for future economic loss ($20 x 672 x 0.85)”.


	
	His Honour’s reference to Mr Fardous being then presently capable of working 20 hours a week appears to have been a slip. Presumably, his Honour was intending to say that, but for the July 2010 accident, Mr Fardous would have been so capable.
	
	
	By agreement of the parties the award for future economic loss was later adjusted to $219,640.
	


RESOLUTION OF THE APPEAL

Economic loss


	
	As noted earlier, it was accepted on appeal that the July 2010 accident destroyed any earning capacity that Mr Fardous then had. The question therefore was whether Mr Fardous had any pre-existing earning capacity and, if so, to what extent. A plaintiff in Mr Fardous’ position must prove “the extent of his or her pre-accident earning capacity, the extent to which that capacity would have been productive of income had the accident not happened, and the extent to which the compensable injuries have diminished his or her ability to exercise the pre-accident earning capacity” (Morvatjou v Moradkhani [2013] NSWCA 157 at [54] citations omitted). In the absence of an issue about a plaintiff’s pre-existing condition emerging from the plaintiff’s case, the defendant has an onus to adduce evidence to raise it. The legal onus nevertheless rests on the plaintiff “upon the whole of the evidence to satisfy the tribunal of fact of the extent of the injury caused by the defendant’s negligence” (Purkess v Crittenden [1965] HCA 34; 114 CLR 164 at 168). In the present case, there was ample material in the evidence led by both the plaintiff and the defendant to raise an issue as to the effect of the 2007 accident on Mr Fardous. Accordingly, no question of the defendant/appellant not discharging an evidentiary onus arose.
	
	
	The medical opinions pre-dating the July 2010 accident suggested that Mr Fardous had at least a theoretical capacity to work for up to 20 hours per week in a relatively sedentary occupation. Whether any such theoretical earning capacity would, but for the July 2010 accident, have been productive of income is a hypothetical question requiring consideration of what would or might have happened in the period up to and after the hearing at first instance if that accident had not occurred. That question is to be answered by determining the degree of probability or possibility that the earning capacity would have been productive of income (Malec v J C Hutton Pty Ltd [1990] HCA 20; 169 CLR 638 at 642-643). The issue is not one of whether an event has or has not occurred. Such an issue would have to be determined on the balance of probabilities and “if the probability of the event having occurred is greater than it not having occurred, the occurrence of the event is treated as certain … ” (ibid).
	
	
	This approach accords with the dictates of s 13 of the Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW) which provides:
	


“Future economic loss—claimant’s prospects and adjustments

(1) A court cannot make an award of damages for future economic loss unless the claimant first satisfies the court that the assumptions about future earning capacity or other events on which the award is to be based accord with the claimant’s most likely future circumstances but for the injury.

(2) When a court determines the amount of any such award of damages for future economic loss it is required to adjust the amount of damages for future economic loss that would have been sustained on those assumptions by reference to the percentage possibility that the events might have occurred but for the injury.

(3) If the court makes an award for future economic loss, it is required to state the assumptions on which the award was based and the relevant percentage by which damages were adjusted.”


	
	Application of this section to the present case requires a statement of the court’s “assumptions” (that is, findings) about the extent to which, but for the July 2010 accident, any earning capacity that Mr Fardous had at the date of the accident would have been productive of income thereafter. This involves a statement of the “percentage possibility” of income of a certain level being earned. As with the assessment of earning capacity remaining after an accident that is the subject of the proceedings, there needs to be a “practical assessment” of the likelihood of the plaintiff having obtained employment (see Nominal Defendant v Livaja [2011] NSWCA 121 at [65]; Mead v Kerney [2012] NSWCA 215 at [18]).
	
	
	The primary judge appears to have proceeded on the basis that it was certain that Mr Fardous had pre-accident earning capacity that, but for the July 2010 accident, would have produced income for 20 hours per week at $20 per hour. This was erroneous given that the evidence did not indicate the certainty of this occurring and, as I have noted, a balance of probabilities approach (if that is what the primary judge adopted) was not appropriate.
	
	
	It is therefore necessary to re-consider the issue. The following matters are relevant in this respect.
	
	
	First, the medical evidence of examinations prior to the settlement on 19 March 2010 of Mr Fardous’ claim against his employer in relation to his 2007 workplace accident gave a relatively bleak assessment of the realistic prospects of Mr Fardous obtaining employment. In August 2008 Dr Bodel referred to only “minimal improvement” in the 18 months since Mr Fardous underwent surgery and around the same time Dr Davies was doubtful of Mr Fardous’ ability to obtain work (see [5] and [6] above).
	
	
	In June 2009 Dr Davis opined that it was more likely than not that Mr Fardous would not obtain employment and in September of that year Dr Kafataris referred to the absence of improvement in Mr Fardous’ symptoms ([8] and [9] above). Nevertheless Dr Kafataris contemplated that Mr Fardous might be able to work up to 20 hours per week and, later, even 40 hours per week (see [10] above). In December 2009 Mr Fardous’ general practitioner, Dr Ismail contemplated that Mr Fardous might be able to work up to 20 hours per week (see [12] above).
	
	
	Secondly, after settlement of his proceedings against his employer, Mr Fardous reported significant improvement in his pain, with Dr Davies later reporting that by the time of his July 2010 accident Mr Fardous asserted that he had little pain (see [15] above). The primary judge accepted that Mr Fardous’ symptoms had improved by March 2010 but concluded that he still had pain at that time (see [18] above).
	
	
	In these circumstances, it is by no means certain that Mr Fardous would, but for his July 2010 accident, have ever resumed significant gainful employment. Nevertheless, his condition was improving by the time of that accident and in my view the medical evidence supports a finding that Mr Fardous had a significant prospect of obtaining employment of 20 hours per week at the rate of $20 per hour. I assess the prospect of this occurring as 65%. The primary judge’s award in respect of both past and future economic loss should be reduced to reflect this percentage, the deduction being in addition to the normal allowance of 15% for vicissitudes of life.
	
	
	There was no evidence to found the primary judge’s specific conclusion, reached when dealing with past economic loss, that Mr Fardous would have obtained work as a security guard and that his rate of pay in that role would have been $20 per hour. However the evidence is sufficient to enable it to be inferred that Mr Fardous had a significant prospect of obtaining some type of part-time employment at this rate. Consistent with this approach, the primary judge, in dealing with future economic loss, referred to Mr Fardous’ capability of obtaining “a light sedentary type job”, paid at the rate of $20 per hour (at [59]).
	
	
	The appellant submitted that it was not open to the Court to conclude, in the absence of evidence, that $20 per hour would have been an achievable rate of pay. In my view the Court can however infer that if Mr Fardous obtained employment that it would have been at least at that modest rate of pay. Depending on the circumstances, the want of specific evidence on aspects of a damages claim does not prevent the court doing the best it can to address the plaintiff’s loss (National Instruments Pty Ltd v Gilles (1975) 49 ALJR 349 at 350; JK Kealley v Jones [1979] NSWLR 723 at 733-734; State of New South Wales v Moss [2000] NSWCA 133; 54 NSWLR 536 at [64]-[87]).
	


Future out-of-pocket expenses


	
	The appellant challenged the primary judge’s awards of $7,000 for the costs of pain relief medication that Mr Fardous was likely to incur in the future and $5,725 for the costs of future consultations with a general medical practitioner. The appellant submitted that Mr Fardous would have incurred these expenses as a result of his September 2007 injury regardless of whether or not he had suffered further injury on 10 July 2010. However in making the awards, his Honour took into account Mr Fardous’ medical needs resulting from the September 2007 accident and only allowed for the cost of additional needs that flowed from the July 2010 accident (Judgment [44] and [45]). There was no error in this approach and no other basis for interfering with his Honour’s assessments was demonstrated.
	
	
	The appellant also challenged the primary judge’s award of $13,000 for the possibility that Mr Fardous might, as a result of his injury suffered in July 2010, need to undergo further surgery. Because his Honour’s finding reflected a submission put to him on behalf of Mr Fardous which the appellant did not attempt to answer, the challenge to his Honour’s award should be rejected on the basis that the appellant is bound by its conduct of the proceedings at first instance.
	


ORDERS


	
	For the reasons that I have given, the quantum of the damages awarded to Mr Fardous in respect of past and future economic loss should be adjusted. Whilst the appellant has had some success on appeal it is only limited success and in my view it should therefore pay 65% of Mr Fardous’ costs of the appeal.
	
	
	I propose the following orders:
	



	
	Appeal allowed.
	
	
	Set aside the judgment of $354,965 entered pursuant to orders made in the District Court on 30 July 2014.
	
	
	Direct that the parties lodge with the Court within 14 days of the date of this judgment a form of consent order varying, in accordance with the Court’s reasons for judgment, the amount of the judgment entered in Mr Fardous’ favour in the District Court or, if the parties are unable to agree on the form of that order, that they lodge proposed orders and submissions in accordance with the following timetable:
	



	
	The appellant within 14 days
	
	
	The respondent within a further 14 days
	
	
	Any reply within a further 7 days.
	



	
	Order the appellant to pay 65% of the respondent’s costs of the appeal.
	



	
	EMMETT JA: The question in this appeal is whether, as at 10 July 2010, the respondent, Mr Abrahim Fardous, had any earning capacity having regard to an accident that he suffered at work on 27 September 2007. That question is relevant to the damages to which Mr Fardous is entitled as a consequence of a fall that he suffered at the Burwood supermarket of the appellant, Coles Supermarkets Australia Pty Ltd (Coles), on 10 July 2010. Mr Fardous injured his back and sued Coles for damages for negligence in the District Court.
	
	
	Coles was found liable and Mr Fardous was awarded damages of $354,965, which included $79,600 for past economic loss, $219,640 for future economic loss and $25,725 for future out-of-pocket expenses. Coles has now appealed to this Court in respect of certain aspects of the assessment of damages. It does not challenge the finding of liability and accepts that the fall on 10 July 2010 destroyed any residual earning capacity that Mr Fardous might have had at that time. However, Coles contends that the District Court should have found that Mr Fardous had no earning capacity at the time of the accident in its supermarket.
	
	
	Section 13 of the Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW) relevantly provides that a court cannot make an award of damages for future economic loss unless the claimant first satisfies the court that the assumptions about future earning capacity or other events on which the award is to be based accord with the claimant’s most likely future circumstances but for the injury. The court is then required to adjust the amount of damages for future economic loss that would have been sustained on those assumptions by reference to the percentage possibility that the events might have occurred but for the injury. The court is required to state the assumptions on which the award was based and the relevant percentage by which the damages were adjusted.
	
	
	I have had the advantage of reading in draft form the proposed reasons of Macfarlan JA. I agree with his Honour that the District Court erred in proceeding on the basis that it was certain that Mr Fardous had a pre-accident earning capacity that, but for the accident on 10 July 2010, would have produced income for 20 hours per week at $20 per hour. I also agree with Macfarlan JA, for the reasons proposed by his Honour, that the medical evidence supports a finding that Mr Fardous had a significant prospect of obtaining employment of 20 hours per week at the rate of $20 per hour and that the prospect of that occurring was 65 per cent. Further, I agree with Macfarlan JA that there was no error on the part of the District Court in the assessment of damages for future out-of-pocket expenses.
	
	
	It follows that the appeal should be allowed. However, the measure of Coles’s success is not great, insofar as it contended that Mr Fardous was entitled to no damages for past and future economic loss. I agree with Macfarlan JA that the appropriate order for costs is to require Coles to bear 65 per cent of Mr Fardous’s costs of the appeal. I agree with the orders proposed by his Honour.
	
	
	SIMPSON J: I agree with Macfarlan JA.

2703631,Bennett v R [2015] NSWCCA 56,"Judgment


	
	SIMPSON J: I agree with Adamson J.
	
	
	ROTHMAN J: I agree with Adamson J
	
	
	ADAMSON J: On 23 March 2012, following a trial by jury before Jeffreys DCJ, the appellant was convicted of one count of conspiring to defraud the Commonwealth and one count of conspiring with the intention of dishonestly causing a loss to the Commonwealth. On 9 October 2013 the appellant was sentenced on the first count to a term of imprisonment of 12 months commencing on 9 October 2013 and on the second count to a term of imprisonment of three years and nine months commencing on 8 October 2014. The non-parole period of two years and four months is due to expire on 7 February 2016.
	
	
	He appeals against both his conviction for the first count and his sentence.
	


The appeal against conviction


	
	The sole ground of appeal against conviction is:
	


“The trial judge’s directions in relation to the requirement of the jury to return consistent verdicts have given rise to a miscarriage of justice in respect of count one.”


	
	In order to understand the context in which the trial judge gave the direction which the appellant seeks to impugn it is necessary to set out the indictment and the relevant legislative provisions as well as to recount in some detail the course which the trial took. This is particularly the case as the direction was given to the jury in response to a question it asked after it had retired to consider its verdict.
	


The indictment


	
	On 19 August 2011 the appellant and his co-accused, Mr Pritchard, were charged on indictment with the following two counts:
	


“1.   Between about 5 July 2000 and about 23 May 2001 at Sydney, New South Wales and elsewhere did conspire with each other, Geoffrey Clive DALEY, Robert Francis AGIUS, Owen Trevor DANIEL, Kevin ZERAFA and divers other persons to defraud the Commonwealth.

Contrary to section 86(1) and section 29D of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth). (Law Part Code 11102).

2.   Between about 24 May 2001 and about 20 March 2006 at Sydney, New South Wales and elsewhere did conspire with each other, Geoffrey Clive DALEY, Robert Francis AGIUS, Owen Trevor DANIEL, Kevin ZERAFA and divers other persons with the intention of dishonestly causing a loss to a third person, namely the Commonwealth.

Contrary to section 135.4(3) of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth). (Law Part Code 41505).”


	
	Although, in substance, there was only one conspiracy alleged the need for two counts on the indictment arose from the statutory provisions set out below: Agius v The Queen [2013] HCA 27; 248 CLR 601
	


The relevant legislation


	
	As at 1 January 1997 until immediately prior to 24 May 2001, s 29D of the Crimes Act relevantly provided:
	


“A person who defrauds the Commonwealth … is guilty of an indictable offence.

Penalty: 1,000 penalty units or imprisonment for 10 years, or both.”


	
	During the same period, s 86 of the Crimes Act relevantly provided:
	


“(1) A person who conspires with another person to commit an offence against a law of the Commonwealth punishable by imprisonment for more than 12 months, or by a fine of 200 penalty units or more, is guilty of the offence of conspiracy to commit that offence and is punishable as if the offence to which the conspiracy relates had been committed.

(2) Despite subsection (1), if the person conspires with another person to commit an offence against section 29D of this Act, the conspiracy is punishable by a fine not exceeding 2,000 penalty units, or imprisonment for a period not exceeding 20 years, or both.”


	
	From 24 May 2001, s 135.4 of the Criminal Code relevantly provided:
	


“(5) A person is guilty of an offence if:

(a) the person conspires with another person to dishonestly cause a loss, or to dishonestly cause a risk of loss, to a third person; and

(b) the first-mentioned person knows or believes that the loss will occur or that there is a substantial risk of the loss occurring; and

(c) the third person is a Commonwealth entity.

Penalty: Imprisonment for 10 years.

…

(9) For a person to be guilty of an offence against this section:

(a) the person must have entered into an agreement with one or more other persons; and

(b) the person and at least one other party to the agreement must have intended to do the thing pursuant to the agreement; and

(c) the person or at least one other party to the agreement must have committed an overt act pursuant to the agreement.”

…


	
	As the wording of subs 135.4(5) of the Criminal Code is different from s 29D and s 86 of the Crimes Act the elements of the two offences are not identical. It was not suggested that any differences between the sections are presently material.
	


The trial: the Crown opening


	
	The Crown opened its case against the appellant on the basis that he was a party to a conspiracy with Mr Pritchard and Mr Daley, a co-conspirator who was a Crown witness, both of whom were associated with Hunter Civil & Hire Pty Ltd (HCH) and three accountants: Messrs Daniel, the principal of Owen T Daniel & Co. (Owen T Daniel); Mr Zerafa, an employee of Owen T Daniel; and Mr Agius, an accountant who practised in Vanuatu and who devised the scheme from which the charges arose. The Crown case was that the agreement that constituted the conspiracy was the “same from the beginning through to the end”. The Crown explained that the reason for the separate counts was the change in the legislation (set out above).
	
	
	The Crown case was that the parties had agreed to implement a scheme whereby certain companies, relevantly HCH, would send money overseas to Uniton Ltd (Uniton), a company registered in the United Kingdom. The money would then ultimately be transferred to Edgecumbe Finance Limited (Edgecumbe), a company registered in Ireland, before being paid back to Australian bank accounts in the guise of a loan. The outgoing monies would be claimed as expenses, although they were not, and deducted from the gross income of the company to reduce its taxable income. The company tax return would then be submitted in which declarations were made that the amounts had been paid for expenses incurred by the company and that the loan monies were not actually income.
	
	
	It was not in issue that the monies that were paid to Uniton were recorded as expenses in the financial statements of HCH and claimed as such in the company’s tax returns. Nor was it in issue that the monies, with some relatively insignificant deductions, were remitted back to Australia. The principal issue was intention. Accordingly, the Crown needed to prove that Mr Bennett knew that the sending of the monies overseas and the receiving of the monies back in Australia were dishonest and that these payments did not entitle HCH to lodge income tax returns in which they were claimed as expenses. The Crown case against the appellant (and Mr Pritchard) was that they knew that the relevant income tax returns contained false statements and that they were submitted pursuant to an agreement to which they were party to defraud the Commonwealth or dishonestly cause loss to the Commonwealth.
	


The defence


	
	Following the conclusion of the Crown’s opening Ms Francis, who appeared for the appellant both at trial and on the appeal, told the jury that the issue in the case was the knowledge and intent with which the appellant participated in the scheme. She said that, to the extent to which the appellant was apprised of the scheme, he believed it to be a legitimate loophole. She described Mr Daley to the jury as a liar whose evidence would be redolent with inconsistencies.
	


Mr Daley’s evidence


	
	Mr Daley was the principal Crown witness. He had pleaded guilty to two charges brought against him in an indictment in terms which corresponded to the indictment presented against the appellant. By his plea he admitted that he had conspired with Mr Agius, Mr Zerafa, Mr Pritchard and the appellant to defraud the Commonwealth, in the period covered by both counts.
	
	
	In the early 1990’s Mr Daley’s business, Geoff Daley Engineering Services, was contracted to provide engineering services to Gardner Perrott, which in turn provided cleaning and maintenance services to large businesses engaged in dirty industrial work, such as BHP. Through this work, Mr Daley met Mr Pritchard, who was then the Newcastle manager for Gardner Perrott and worked out of an office in Carrington, a suburb of Newcastle. Mr Pritchard introduced Mr Daley to Mr Britton, the Sydney Operations Manager for Gardner Perrott. Subsequently, after Mr Pritchard had become the State Manager of Gardner Perrott, Mr Daley met the appellant who also worked for Gardner Perrott.
	
	
	In 1998 Gardner Perrott won the tender to provide maintenance services to OneSteel which operated the business BHP had previously operated in Mayfield, a suburb of Newcastle. The appellant, who was responsible for managing services provided by Gardner Perrott to OneSteel, engaged Mr Daley as Occupational Health & Safety officer.
	
	
	Within a month of Gardner Perrott winning the OneSteel contract, the appellant, Mr Pritchard, Mr Britton and Mr Daley discussed forming a company to perform some of the work which was covered by the OneSteel contract. The appellant, Mr Pritchard and Mr Britton were reluctant to become directors of the new company as they were both long-standing employees of Gardner Perrott. Ultimately it was agreed that only Mr Daley would be registered as a director and shareholder of the new company, HCH, although all four would be involved in the business.
	
	
	HCH was registered on 27 September 1999. Each of the four (the appellant, Mr Pritchard, Mr Britton and himself) put $5,000 into a bank account which was opened in HCH’s name. In the same month, Mr Daley resigned from his employment with Gardner Perrott. According to Mr Daley, decisions regarding HCH were made by the four at management meetings which were held at least once a month.
	
	
	In early 2000, Mr Britton suggested to Mr Daley, the appellant and Mr Pritchard that they should engage Owen T Daniel as HCH’s accountants. In the latter part of 2000, the four went to the offices of Owen T Daniel at Five Dock. Mr Daniel told them about a scheme which was designed to reduce company tax, which he described as an “Around the World Trading Scheme”. He explained that it involved money being sent out of Australia to New Zealand and other countries before being sent back to its sender in Australia. Mr Daniel told them that it would be hard for the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) to find fault with the scheme. He explained that a deduction, by way of service fee, would be made in Vanuatu where Mr Agius (the progenitor of the scheme) was based. Mr Zerafa, who worked for Owen T Daniel, was introduced as the point of contact. Mr Daniel told those present that they should keep their “mouths shut” and not let it be known that they were using the scheme.
	
	
	Mr Daley had reservations about the legitimacy of the scheme from the time it was first discussed. His concerns were not assuaged when Mr Daniel told them that he had up to 500 people in Australia engaged in the scheme, including police and other influential people.
	
	
	The day after the meeting, the four met and decided to engage Owen T Daniel as HCH’s tax accountants. Mr Daley did not recall any of the participants raising any concern that the scheme was either illegal or dishonest or any discussion as to whether it was.
	
	
	After this meeting Mr Daley engaged Owen T Daniel as HCH’s accountants and became HCH’s contact person. Mr Daley obtained details from Mr Zerafa of where to send the money and how much should be sent. He accepted that he continued as HCH’s contact person at least until Ian Shute began as the new book-keeper in March 2002.
	
	
	Mr Daley kept documents connected with the “Around the World Trading Scheme” in a separate file box in the offices of HCH.
	
	
	At the first monthly meeting between the four after Owen T Daniel’s engagement, a report for September 2000 was tabled which recorded under the heading “Financial Issues”:
	


“Dianne Allen & Associates initial contact has been made regarding the transfer of our financial matters to another accountancy firm.

Owen T Daniel to be formally engaged.

1999-2000 Tax issues

A policy for Vanuatu to be formalised so the BAS can be completed.

Business Activity Statement to be addressed.

Letters of comfort no progress as yet.”


	
	On 12 December 2000 Owen T Daniel sent a facsimile to Mr Daley which contained the bank account details of Uniton, to which the monies would be paid. Mr Daley noted in handwriting the sum of $112,000 to be sent to Uniton pursuant to the scheme. The figure had been recommended by Mr Zerafa, who had seen the balance sheets and profit and loss statements for HCH and had decided that HCH could afford to send $112,000.
	
	
	Mr Daley discussed the figure of $112,000 with the other three either in person at a management meeting or over the telephone before sending a facsimile to Owen T Daniel on 12 December 2000 confirming the bank account details of the HCH account into which the money should be paid on its return to Australia.
	
	
	On 13 December 2000 Mr Daley filled in an international money transfer application for money to be transferred from HCH’s account to an account in Auckland which Owen T Daniel had nominated for Uniton. He appreciated when he did so that his name would be associated with the transfer.
	
	
	On 15 December 2000 Mr Daley received a facsimile from Mr Zerafa in the following terms:
	


“. . . I have confirmed that the funds have been received o’seas and that they are being sent back today. (should be here on Monday)

Could you please complete the form attached to this fax and fax back to me.

Any correspondence of transfers o’seas should be clearly marked with your client number 7313. This will allow them to distinguish who you are. . . .”


	
	Mr Daley filled in the attached form, which was entitled “Company Application and Trust Account Opening Authority” which he understood would authorise the money to be sent around the world. He wrote in the space provided for “Special Instructions”:
	


“Please phone before fax.

All postal correspondence to be marked private attention Geoff Daley.”


	
	Mr Daley explained that he gave this instruction because his daughter worked in the office sometimes and he did not want her to tell his wife that he was involved in “round the world” trading.
	
	
	The HCH cheque account from which the $112,000 was withdrawn showed that it was processed on 13 December 2000 and that $103,585 was deposited into the same account on 15 December 2000 by “INTERNATIONAL FINANC”. Mr Daley explained that, although he did not understand it at the time, he later learned that “INTERNATIONAL FINANC” was a reference to International Finance Trust Corporation, the entity through which the funds were sent back to Australia. Mr Daley’s evidence was that he discussed each of these documents with the appellant and Mr Pritchard, as well as Mr Britton, if the latter was present.
	
	
	Mr Daley gave evidence that every fortnight, after the first “around the world” transaction, he would cash a cheque for $8,000 drawn on HCH’s bank account, which was initially the account from which the monies had been withdrawn to pay Uniton. Of the $8,000, he would retain $2,000 for himself and pay $2,000 each to the appellant, Mr Pritchard and Mr Britton at the management meetings. It was the appellant who coined the expression “the eagle” for the distribution of cash at management meetings. The expression, which became a useful shorthand code among the four, was both a reference to the bird on the United States currency and an allusion to the phrase, “the eagle has landed”.
	
	
	By letter dated 23 January 2001, Owen T Daniel wrote to HCH purporting to convey an offer from Edgecumbe of a $1m loan facility. Mr Daley regarded the purpose of the document as being to complete the paper trail of “around the world” transactions, rather than as creating a true loan facility. Although Mr Daley said that he would have discussed the letter with Mr Pritchard and Mr Bennett, he accepted that he did not have any diary notes of meetings with them that took place between January and June 2001.
	
	
	A further cheque in the sum of $112,000 was sent to Uniton on 21 February 2001. A corresponding cheque requisition, which was filled in by Jason Hart, HCH’s book-keeper, represented that the sum was referable to an account rendered for “consultancy fees”. Mr Daley said that no attempt was made to hide from Mr Hart that $112,000 was being sent to Uniton. HCH’s bank statement showed this withdrawal and a deposit on 27 February 2001 of $111,885 by “INTERNATIONAL FINANC”.
	
	
	As HCH had commenced trading in September 1999, it was obliged to lodge a tax return for the year ended 30 June 2000. At some time prior to the lodgement of HCH’s income tax return for 2000, Mr Zerafa sent Mr Daley four documents which purported to be invoices dated 30 September 1999, 31 December 1999, 31 March 2000 and 30 June 2000, each in the sum of $28,000, apparently issued by Uniton for “marketing and consulting services”. No such services had ever been provided. Mr Daley identified, in the profit and loss statement included in HCH’s tax return, a line item in the sum of $112,000 said to be for “management and consulting fees”. This amount had the effect of increasing the line item “all other expenses” by $112,000 and reducing HCH’s operating profit to $5,452.
	
	
	Owen T Daniel forwarded the draft tax return for the 2000 financial year to the “directors” of HCH (although Mr Daley was, at that time, the sole director) under cover of letter dated 27 March 2001. Mr Daley’s evidence was that, before signing HCH’s 2000 income tax return on 29 March 2001, he tabled the draft tax return and discussed it with the other three, either at one of their management meetings or on the telephone. He denied the proposition put to him by Mr Johnston (counsel for Mr Pritchard at trial) in cross-examination that he just signed the document without speaking to Mr Pritchard or the appellant.
	
	
	On 18 May 2001 Mr Daley opened an account in his own name into which the “around the world” cheques were deposited when they were returned to Australia. The purpose of this account was to create a paper trail for the loan account. Mr Daley explained that the account had to be in his name as he was HCH’s only registered director.
	
	
	By the end of the period which was the subject of the first count, 23 May 2001, the diagram provided to the jury showed that the following amounts had been transmitted “around the world” by HCH:
	



	
		
			
			Date sent
			
			
			Amount
			
			
			Date returned
			
			
			Amount
			
		
		
			
			13 Dec 2000
			
			
			$112,000
			
			
			15 Dec 2000
			
			
			$103,600
			
		
		
			
			21 Feb 2001
			
			
			$112,000
			
			
			27 Feb 2001
			
			
			$111,900
			
		
		
			
			7 May 2001
			
			
			$56,000
			
			
			16 May 2001
			
			
			$55,900
			
		
		
			
			29 May 2001
			
			
			$56,000
			
			
			5 June 2001
			
			
			$55,900
			
		
	



	
	The last of these amounts, received on 5 June 2001 was paid into the account in Mr Daley’s name, rather than into HCH’s cheque account. Mr Daley denied the proposition put to him by Mr Johnston that he was content that for the payment received on 5 June 2001 to be paid into an account in his name because he did not consider that he was participating in a scheme that was illegal. He said that he had concerns about the legitimacy of the scheme. Evidence which Mr Daley had given at committal proceedings was put to him by Mr Johnston but Mr Daley reiterated his earlier answer and said that he had “reservations about its [the scheme’s] legality”. Mr Daley accepted that it was possible that he had kept his reservations to himself at that stage.
	
	
	The tax return for the year ended 30 June 2001 indicated that $560,000 was referable to “management and consulting fees”. This sum represented a fivefold increase in the amount for the previous financial year of $112,000. A gross income from sales in the order of $2.2m was recorded in HCH’s profit and loss statement for the 2001 financial year.
	
	
	The appellant and Mr Pritchard, who were still working for Gardner Perrott, often visited HCH’s office to see how the contract between HCH and Gardner Perrott was going and to talk to Mr Daley.
	
	
	On 15 June 2001, following discussions with the appellant and Mr Pritchard, Mr Daley registered a company called Hydro-Magda Pty Ltd (HM). HM was established to process some of the waste and heavy contamination from the old BHP site that was being demolished. Gardner Perrot was party to a contract with BHP to remove the sludge. Mr Pritchard and the appellant arranged for the work to be done by HM and determined, without consulting Mr Daley, that the profits of HM would be divided between the appellant’s son, Adam, and Mr Pritchard’s son, Andrew, as to 50% and the remaining 50% would be split equally between Mr Daley, the appellant and Mr Pritchard. Mr Pritchard justified the split to Mr Daley on the basis that Adam Bennett and Andrew Pritchard would be doing the work and the appellant and Mr Pritchard would be retaining management of the project. According to Mr Daley, Mr Pritchard and the appellant controlled what was happening with the business of HM in which their sons worked.
	
	
	At some stage, shortly after the formation of HM, the appellant suggested that HM should obtain an insurance policy to demonstrate “good faith” and that the job was being done correctly. It was proposed that the premium be sent “around the world”. Mr Pritchard also suggested that the profits of HM could be sent “around the world”. According to Mr Daley, the appellant said, “That’s a good idea”.
	
	
	Mr Daley’s evidence was that, in about June 2001, the appellant and Mr Pritchard suggested forming a company which would operate as a labour hire company for HCH, HM, Gardner Perrott and any other client on the OneSteel site. Daley Labour Pty Ltd (DL) was registered on 20 July 2001 and Mr Daley was its sole director. DL did not participate in the “around the world” scheme. In July 2001 the four participants (Mr Daley, Mr Pritchard, Mr Britton and the appellant) decided to pay themselves $10,000 a quarter as a dividend.
	
	
	Mr Daley gave evidence that he, the appellant and Mr Pritchard met Robert Agius in August 2001 at the office of Owen T Daniel at Burwood. In the course of the meeting, Mr Agius explained to those present how the “around the world” transactions worked. He drew a diagram which showed that the money would go to New Zealand and then to Vanuatu, where a service fee would be deducted and then it would return via several other countries and come back to Australia through Ireland. Mr Daley admitted in cross-examination by Mr Johnston that Mr Agius did not provide any assurances about the legitimacy of the “round the world” trading scheme at the meeting; nor had Mr Daley raised with him any concerns he had about the legitimacy of the scheme.
	
	
	Mr Daley gave evidence of further transactions involving “round the world” routes as well as the monies being made available to him, Mr Bennett and Mr Pritchard as loans.
	
	
	Towards the end of 2001, Mr Hart, who had been the book keeper for HCH and HM, told Mr Daley of his concern that there was an inadequate paper trail.
	
	
	Mr Daley raised Mr Hart’s concerns with Mr Zerafa, who suggested they come up with wording for the invoices for “around the world” payments that indicated that services, such as “intellectual knowledge” and “technical assistance”, rather than goods, were being supplied.
	
	
	Mr Hart’s services were terminated in March 2002 and Mr Shute was engaged to replace him as book keeper. Mr Shute was authorised to sign cheques on behalf of HCH, HM and DL. He also prepared the agenda, financial statements and any additional documents required for the monthly meetings. Some time later Mr Shute told Mr Daley that he thought that Mr Daley, Mr Pritchard and the appellant were “in a fair amount of trouble” with respect to the “around the world” transactions. Mr Daley relayed Mr Shute’s comment to Mr Pritchard and the appellant.
	
	
	In 2002, Mr Britton left the group and no longer participated in these transactions.
	
	
	In 2002, as a result of the appellant’s suggestion referred to above, HM purported to obtain an insurance policy from “Southern Hemisphere Insurance” for HM’s work for OneSteel. The appellant, Mr Pritchard and Mr Daley agreed that the so-called “insurance premiums”, which amounted to three payments of $200,000 would be sent “around the world”. One such payment of $200,000 was made on 24 June 2002. It was known and discussed among the three participants (the appellant, Mr Pritchard and Mr Daley) that the insurance policy was, as the appellant put it, a “smoke and mirrors” policy in that it was merely a cover for payments to be sent “around the world”.
	
	
	Towards the end of November 2002, Mr Pritchard and the appellant attended the premises of HCH regularly, and sometimes daily. The appellant suggested describing the intellectual knowledge on the invoices in respect of funds that were sent “around the world” as “spent pot linings”. Spent pot linings were a waste product of an aluminium smelter.
	
	
	In about November 2002, the appellant finished working for Gardner Perrott. On 20 November 2002 he and Mr Pritchard were registered as directors of HCH. At around this time, Mr Daley told the appellant and Mr Pritchard that he was concerned about being the only person who had his name on any “around the world” documents and felt that he was being left in the lurch. He told them that, unless they were prepared to put their names on documents, he would go to the ATO to expose the “around the world” scheme. According to Mr Daley, the appellant said that someone had to stay clean and that he was not going to put his name to anything since he did not want any problems that would affect the payments he was making for child support.
	
	
	Mr Daley told the appellant and Mr Pritchard that he was also concerned that, as a result of what occurred on 11 September 2001 (the destruction of the Twin Towers in New York), the Australian Government was scrutinising monies that were being sent overseas. Ms Francis, on behalf of the appellant, cross-examined Mr Daley about when he first realised that the scheme was illegal. She put to him that it was only after the media’s scrutiny about international transactions after that date that he started turning his mind to the illegality, he rejected the proposition and said:
	


“I probably always had a thought in the back of my mind that it was not a legitimate operation but I never went and paid due diligence and checked it out. I accepted what I was told and what I was involved in was borderline and that it was okay.”


	
	The last occasion on which Mr Daley sent money “around the world” for HCH or HM was 13 December 2002. However the payments continued to be made. Although Mr Shute was concerned about the legitimacy of these payments, he was prepared to create the requisite documents subject to the directions from the directors.
	
	
	On 1 October 2003 HM was deregistered once the work it had been contracted to do had been completed.
	
	
	Towards the end of 2005 Mr Daley decided to leave the businesses. Mr Pritchard and the appellant asked him to close down the “around the world” transactions before his departure.
	
	
	Mr Daley proposed that Mr Pritchard and the appellant would buy out his share in the businesses. At about this time, Mr Daley decided to go to the ATO in Newcastle with the documents he had retained from the “around the world” transactions. Mr Daley also met with Mr Agius who told him that there was a balance due to him of $192,000, being money that had not yet returned from its trip “around the world”. Mr Agius confirmed the amount by writing on a paper bag, which Mr Daley photocopied. Mr Agius set out how the $192,000 was to be invested for Mr Daley and gave the document to him. Mr Daley did not follow up what happened to this sum or any proceeds from the investment. Nonetheless he retained the document in case he died so that his beneficiaries could get the benefit of the money.
	
	
	In about 2008 or 2009 Mr Daley was approached by officers of the Australian Federal Police. He provided them with documents associated with the “around the world” transactions.
	


The balance of the Crown case


	
	The Crown also adduced evidence from Mr Shute. It is not necessary to detail his evidence since it solely concerned the second charge. Federal agent Needham gave evidence as did James Walton, Manager of the High Wealth Individuals Task Force of the ATO.
	
	
	Neither the appellant nor Mr Pritchard gave or adduced evidence.
	


Crown’s closing address


	
	The Crown, in its closing address, contended that there was a single conspiracy and that there were two counts only because of the change in the law. The Crown anticipated the submission that it might be suggested to the jury that the appellant and Mr Pritchard were not participating in a conspiracy prior to 23 May 2001 and referred to the cross-examination of Mr Daley to the effect that he did not really believe that the scheme was unlawful prior to 23 May 2001. The Crown submitted that the jury would be satisfied that the conspiracy was on foot, if not by the time of the initial meeting at Owen R Daniel in which the “round the world” scheme was explained, then certainly by the time the first $112,000 was sent overseas.
	


The closing address on behalf of the appellant


	
	Ms Francis submitted that the Crown had failed to prove that Mr Bennett acted with a dishonest state of mind. She emphasised that there was no evidence of conversations between Mr Daley and the appellant about the illegality of the scheme as follows:
	


“What we do now at this point is that Mr Daley has been communicating with the offices of Owen T Daniel and he hasn’t as a consequence of those meetings given any evidence of communicating to the accused any concerns that he had or that arose from his ongoing discussions and exposure to the scheme as it was represented by Owen T Daniel. He gives evidence of not one conversation to the effect of I’ve been on the phone to these guys, this all seems a bit on the nose, it’s a bit dodgy, what do you think? It’s a bit concerning, what do you think Mr Bennett? Not one conversation and why is that? Because those conversations didn’t happen.

So between the date of this meeting with Owen T Daniel in the middle of 2000 and the first of the transactions in December of 2000, there is not one conversation which assists you between Mr Daley and Mr Bennett in determining Mr Bennett’s guilty state of mind. Not one admission made by him as to this scheme being rort with dishonest means. This is the Crown case. It’s for the Crown to prove beyond a reasonable doubt, that Mr Bennett was possessed of this state of mind and you have not one piece of evidence that would assist you in coming to that conclusion emanating from Mr Daley and his conversations with the accused.”


	
	Ms Francis also highlighted Mr Daley’s evidence about the relevance of 11 September 2001 for the purposes of impugning his credibility. She told the jury, in substance, that they would not believe that Mr Daley’s concerns arose only after 11 September 2001 because he knew that the scheme was dishonest from the outset. She said:
	


“As we know from what my learned friend read to you today, of Mr Daley’s evidence at the Committal hearing, you can be comforted in the conclusion that here was no such conversation between Mr Daley and the accused because on his own account of himself, it was possibly 12 months after the events of September 11 until he came to a realisation that this scheme was illegal. And may well he might have come to that realisation by September of 2002, that is 12 months after September 11. May well he have come to that conclusion. But you might ask why did it take until 12 months when he had been involved in the Southern Hemisphere Insurance scam. What, it took him a year? He didn’t realise when he entered into that fraudulent insurance scam and you know what the defence case is about that. It was not Mr Bennett’s idea. Indeed it didn’t flow on from Mr Daley’s evidence as to when he first said Mr Bennett brought up this idea of approaching Owen T Daniel. You know what the defence case is. Mr Bennet has absolutely nothing to do with that scheme. But Mr Daley gives evidence, ‘I didn’t realise until 12 months after September 11 2001 that this scheme was a fraud.’ But he has been personally, effecting quite a significant fraud you might think in respect of Southern Hemisphere Insurances.

What the Crown case wants to import is a particular state of mind resting in Mr Bennett said to arise from various representations made by Owen T Daniel back in the middle of 2000. When I say Owen T Daniel I mean the representatives of the office. But the critical issue for you is what was in agreement into which Mr Bennett entered at such time as he participated in this scheme. That’s the critical issue for you and the evidence of Mr Daley does not assist you in coming to any reliable conclusions about that.”

[Emphasis added.]


	
	The highlighted passage does not accurately summarise Mr Daley’s evidence, which is set out in more detail above. However, it indicates the purpose for which Ms Francis was relying on the evidence, which was solely to impugn Mr Daley’s credit. Its purpose was not to make out a case that the appellant was not guilty on the first count on the basis that his knowledge at that stage would not have been greater than Mr Daley’s and Mr Daley did not know that the scheme was dishonest until after 23 May 2001.
	
	
	Ms Francis did not distinguish between the periods covered by the separate charges. The appellant’s case was put in the following extract from her final address:
	


“…The critical issue for you is with what state of mind did Mr Bennett enter into these transactions. If you cannot exclude the reasonable possibility that he was acting honestly on the advice of his accountants that you would return a verdict of not guilty.

That is some of the context in which the agreement was forged between these men at some point after the meeting in the middle of 2000 and the first of the transactions in December 2000. But there is also some relevant context which you can draw from what was said and the evidence which attaches to the period when in November 2005 when the accused voluntarily shut down their involvement in the scheme. This is at a time when Mr Shute indicated to them that the scheme might fall foul of a particular provision of the tax provision which concerned itself with fraud, but a provision which was directed towards schemes which had at their heart the object of minimising tax and I won’t try and outline for you what the terms of that provision is. I’m sure his Honour will do that for you and you’ve already heard his Honour give you some directions in that regard.

But at such time as Mr Bennett and Mr Pritchard were advised in a certain way by the company accountant to remove themselves form the scheme they did. They accede to the advice of their company accountant and they went to the offices of Owen T Daniel with a view of withdrawing from the scheme.”

The summing up


	
	The trial judge reminded the jury of the reasons for there being two counts in the indictment as follows:
	


“…And the only reason that you have got two counts in the indictment is because it used to be before May 2001, the conspiracy to defraud the Commonwealth. And then the parliament, remember I told you that parliament can change the law, they changed the law and now it is not a conspiracy to defraud the Commonwealth, it is a conspiracy to cause the Commonwealth financial loss. And I have told you that effectively the same thing it is just a different way of describing it because to defraud is to cause somebody financial loss.”


	
	The Crown case was summarised by the trial judge as amounting to a single conspiracy in the following terms:
	


“So he said it is one conspiracy. He said that the conspiracy was entered into well before 2001. He said that it started when the men went to Owen T Daniel and certain things were discussed. He said that the following day the men agreed to go and participate in the round the world trading. He told you that by 23 December 2000 when the $112,000 was the first lot of money that went out that the conspiracy must have taken place. That is the agreement must have been formed, the meeting of the minds in relation to it must have been formed before that.

He said that you would be satisfied that by that time the first lot of money had gone overseas, the conspiracy was under way.”


	
	In an adjournment in the course of the summing up the trial judge sought counsel’s comments on a draft document to be provided to the jury that set out the elements of each of the two charges. The following exchange then ensued:
	


“CROWN PROSECUTOR: The last thing, your Honour, is just a reference – I haven’t thought whereabouts in the document this should go, but that conspiracy is a continuing offence and that an accused may join the conspiracy at any time.

HIS HONOUR: That was never put to the jury.

CROWN PROSECUTOR: No.

HIS HONOUR: I don’t propose to put it.

CROWN PROSECUTOR: Certainly, your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: And the difficulty with saying things like that is the Crown case, as I understand it, is it is one conspiracy and that it effectively started with Owen T Daniel et al in July/August 2001.

CROWN PROSECUTOR: 2000.

HIS HONOUR: 2000, sorry. Once you start talking about the continuance and once you start talking about joining at any time that’s fraught with all sorts of difficulties, because you are then importing into things that these people may have found out in May of 2001 sort of thing, that’s my concern. I am not going to do that unless somebody wants me to. Mr Johnston?

FRANCIS: No, your Honour.”

The jury question


	
	The jury was sent out to consider its verdict at 11.44am on 23 March 2012. Later that day the jury send a note which read:
	


“Can you have a different verdict for each count for each of the accused, i.e does count 1 need to be consistent with [count] 2?”


	
	The Crown’s initial response was that it was possible for the jury to bring in different verdicts on each count if they found that there was relevantly a change in circumstances. The Crown suggested that Mr Daley’s concern following 11 September 2001 could amount to a change in circumstances. The trial judge raised with the Crown that the Crown had not presented its case that way and reminded him of the submission of one single conspiracy. Nonetheless the Crown maintained its position that different verdicts could be returned and, by implication, that the jury ought be directed accordingly. The following exchange ensued between the trial judge, Mr Johnston and Mr Reinoso, the appellant’s solicitor, who was called upon to answer in Ms Francis’ absence:
	


JOHNSTON: Your Honour I agree, the Crown never ran a case that the accused joined the conspiracy to date after December 2000 in effect that the conspiracy was complete by that time and it’s just a continuing offence, we didn’t come to meet that case, and the jury need to be directed.

HIS HONOUR: I propose to tell the jury that the way that the case has been conducted that there is one conspiracy and that the conspiracy was underway by 13 December 2000 which is the first payment and the only reason that they got two counts is because there was a change in the legislation so that if they bring in a verdict of guilty on the first count then that is a matter which they would deal with in relation to the second count and vice versa, do you have a problem with that?

JOHNSTON: No your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: All right we’ll have the jury please.

I’m sorry I didn’t Mr, is your position --

REINOSO: I echo the position from Mr Johnston, no your Honour.”


	
	The jury was brought back into Court and the trial judge directed the jury as follows:
	


“HIS HONOUR: Well first of all, there are separate trials here. That is, a trial between the Crown and Mr Pritchard, and a trial between the Crown and Mr Bennett. So, so far as those separate trials are concerned you can certainly bring in different verdicts between Mr Pritchard and Mr Bennett.

The way the Crown has run its case, you will remember the Crown has said to you that there is one conspiracy, and the Crown has said to you that the conspiracy was underway by the latest, the first payment that goes overseas which is on 13 December 2000. And that effectively the reason why you have two counts in the indictment rather than one is because of the change in the legislation which made it no longer a conspiracy to defraud – which means to cause loss anyway, dishonestly cause loss – to conspiracy to dishonestly cause loss. So it is the same conspiracy, but because of the change in the legislation, that is why you have the two counts.

What that means is, because it is the same conspiracy and it is underway at the latest by 13 December 2000, then it means that so far as the individuals are concerned – that is, Mr Pritchard or Mr Bennett – the verdict that you bring in, in relation to the first count for that accused, whether it is guilty or not guilty, is it would be wrong for you to bring in a different verdict on the second count. In other words, it would be wrong to bring in a verdict of guilty on the first count, not guilty on the second count; or not guilty on the first count and guilty on the second count. Does that answer your question?”

Ground 1: direction to return consistent verdicts


	
	Ms Francis submitted that there was a factual basis for the jury to distinguish between the first and second counts and that the trial judge had answered the jury’s question incorrectly.
	
	
	The basis of the appellant’s appeal against conviction was contrary to the course taken on his behalf at the trial, contrary to the submissions made on his behalf when the written directions were being settled by the judge in consultation with counsel and contrary to the submissions made when the judge consulted the parties’ legal representatives before answering the question. Accordingly the appellant requires this Court’s leave under rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules 1952 (NSW) before he is permitted to rely on the sole ground of his conviction appeal. As the merits of the ground are a factor to be taken into account in whether leave ought be granted, it is necessary to address them.
	
	
	Ms Francis relied on the fact that Mr Daley had been the sole contact for the accountants for the whole of the period of the first charge and that, although Mr Daley had given evidence of management meetings at which the appellant and Mr Pritchard had been present, he had been unable to recall the detail of such meetings. She contended that there was no discussion to which the appellant was a party during the period encompassed by the first charge in the course of which the dishonesty or illegality of the scheme had been discussed.
	
	
	Ms Francis placed substantial reliance on Mr Daley’s evidence. I understood it to be her submission that it could reasonably be inferred that the appellant did not appreciate that the transactions were dishonest until at least the point at which Mr Daley did. She contended:
	


“Mr Daley’s evidence was that it was not until September 2002 that he appreciated the illegality of the scheme.”


	
	The substance of Mr Daley’s evidence can be dealt with first. I do not consider that Ms Francis has accurately summarised his evidence. As I read his evidence, Mr Daley had reservations about the legality of the scheme from the outset. He appreciated that the purpose of the scheme was to make it look as if money was being lawfully expended by the issue of fake invoices for intangibles so that they could not be readily identified as fake. He appreciated that the reason the money had to go through so many different accounts was so that it would be difficult to trace.
	
	
	In addition, the jury had been told that Mr Daley had pleaded guilty to both counts, which carried with it an admission that he had had the requisite intent to defraud the Commonwealth in the period covered by the first count, which was well before 11 September 2001, as well as the later period.
	
	
	The relevance of 11 September 2001 was that the Commonwealth was, after that date, tracing large sums of money that were sent overseas, which increased the risk that the scheme would be detected. Mr Daley was concerned because he, as sole director of HCH until March 2002, whose name was on relevant documents, was the most obvious culprit amongst his co-conspirators, the appellant and Mr Pritchard. Further, there was a premise in Ms Francis’ analysis which was, in my view, missing: that the appellant’s state of mind or knowledge of the dishonesty of the transactions ought be judged by Mr Daley’s state of mind or knowledge of the dishonesty of the transactions.
	
	
	There is, in my view, a more fundamental reason why the appellant cannot make out the ground of appeal on conviction. Ms Francis, on his behalf, ran the case in a particular way. She did not distinguish between the first and second counts either in the way in which she cross-examined the witnesses, or the way in which she addressed the jury. Her conduct of the trial is relevant to more than just the question whether leave ought be granted under rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules since it informs the content of the trial judge’s obligations.
	
	
	Although Ms Francis referred the jury to Mr Daley’s evidence about the illegality of the scheme and the connection with September 11 2001, the purpose of the submission was not to distinguish between his knowledge of the dishonesty of the transactions during the period covered by the first count as distinct from the second count. Rather, it was to challenge his credibility and his reliability and invite the jury to disbelieve him because he was prepared to dissemble about his earlier appreciation of the illegality of the scheme. In substance, she submitted to the jury that they could not believe that he did not appreciate its illegality until September 2002 because he was well aware of it from the outset. The appellant’s case was that Mr Daley had not deposed to any conversation the appellant in which they had discussed the illegality of the scheme with or Mr Daley’s reservations about it. As the appellant had not given evidence, his state of mind was necessarily a matter of inference.
	
	
	Ms Francis also relied on the increasing magnitude of the sums sent “around the world” in the period covered by the second charge as compared with the first. She submitted that the jury might not have been satisfied of the dishonest intent at the outset (during the period of the first charge) but might have been satisfied of it later when the sums became more substantial. I regard this submission as purely speculative as no submission was made to the jury to that effect. Moreover, the sums covered by the first charge were still significant. The first payment of $112,000 had the effect of reducing the net profit of HCH for the 2001 financial year to a negligible figure.
	
	
	The trial judge heard from the parties as to how the jury’s question ought be answered. The Crown wanted the question to be answered “yes” and both accused wanted the question to be answered “no”. The trial judge acceded to the co-accuseds’ preference, which accorded with his Honour’s preliminary view.
	
	
	The weight to be given to the forensic decisions of counsel in a trial was considered in James v The Queen [2014] HCA 6 in the context of alternative verdicts. The appellant, James, was convicted of intentionally causing serious injury. There was a second, alternative, count on the indictment of recklessly causing serious injury. The Crown case was that James’ conduct was deliberate. The defence case was that it was accidental. The addresses and summing up did not address the alternative count. The jury asked a question, during its retirement, about the distinction between an intention to cause serious injury (the mental element of the first count) and awareness that the accused’s acts would probably cause serious injury (the mental element of the alternative count).
	
	
	The Crown raised, for the first time, whether the jury should be instructed of the availability of a further alternative verdict: that James had intentionally caused injury, but not serious injury. The trial judge responded that the Crown case had not been put on that basis and expressed the view that to leave a further alternative verdict at that stage of the trial would deprive James of the chance of an acquittal. James’ counsel was taken to have acceded to that proposition. The jury was neither instructed of the availability of the alternative verdict of recklessly causing injury, nor of intentionally causing injury. James was convicted of intentionally causing serious injury.
	
	
	The High Court in James v The Queen posed the relevant question at [6]:
	


“. . . whether, on a trial on indictment, it is the duty of the judge to leave any lesser alternative verdict that is realistically open on the evidence regardless of the forensic decisions of counsel.”


	
	In answering the question in the negative, the plurality (French CJ, Hayne, Crennan, Kiefel, Bell and Keane JJ) considered the balance to be struck between, on the one hand, the obligation of the trial judge to secure for the accused a fair trial according to law (Pemble v The Queen [1971] HCA 20; 124 CLR 107 at 117-118 per Barwick CJ) and, on the other, the forensic decisions of trial counsel made for tactical reasons in what are perceived by them to be the best interests of the accused.
	
	
	The importance of the principle that an accused person is bound by the way his or her counsel ran the trial is not to be underestimated. It would be a serious matter for this Court to authorise, much less require, trial judges to undo the forensic decisions made by counsel (which are taken to be in the best interests of the accused) to the possible detriment of the accused, where the interests of justice did not require it. Had the trial judge rejected the submissions of Mr Johnston and the appellant’s solicitor and directed the jury in the way for which the Crown contended and the appellant been acquitted of the first count and convicted on the second, the appellant might have had a legitimate sense of grievance. In that event the appellant might well have appealed to this Court for an order quashing the conviction on the second count on the grounds of inconsistent verdicts, having regard to the way in which the trial was conducted.
	
	
	Moreover, it is to be assumed that counsel make forensic decisions, particularly ones of such significance, on instructions. A trial judge, who is not privy to those instructions, is entitled to assume that counsel’s positions reflect them.
	
	
	At trial, the appellant had a choice: he could either have defended the charges on the basis that the Crown had not proved that he was party to a conspiracy at all because he did not have the dishonest intent; or he could, through his counsel, could invite the jury to differentiate between his intention prior to 23 May 2001 and after that date. However, the foundation for a defence on this basis would require some foundation in the cross-examination of Mr Daley and the submissions made on behalf of the appellant. Had he chosen the latter option, the risk of conviction on the second count would have been higher, although the risk of conviction on the first count may well have been lower. The former option had the benefit of preserving the chance of outright acquittal. This was a choice that the appellant was entitled to have his counsel make. Although it did not turn out to be the better choice, as he was convicted on both counts, the merit of a strategy ought not be judged in hindsight.
	
	
	In my view, the appellant ought be bound by the way his counsel conducted the trial, which was not to differentiate between the periods in the two counts, as far as the appellant’s intention was concerned. To allow the appeal against conviction in the present appeal would tend to undermine the importance of the role of defence counsel in a trial. As Gleeson CJ said in R v Birks (1990) 19 NSWLR 677 at 683 - 684:
	


“In our system of criminal justice a trial of an accused person is conductedin the manner of a contest between the Crown and the accused, and that trialhas many (although not all) of the features which attend civil litigationconducted in accordance with what is sometimes described as the adversarysystem of justice. To a large extent the parties to such proceedings are boundby the manner in which they conduct them. . . .

As a general rule, a party is bound by the conduct of his or her counsel,and counsel have a wide discretion as to the manner in which proceedingsare conducted. Decisions as to what witnesses to call, what questions to askor not to ask, what lines of argument to pursue and what points to abandon,are all matters within the discretion of counsel and frequently involvedifficult problems of judgment, including judgment as to tactics. Theauthorities concerning the rights and duties of counsel are replete withemphatic statements which stress both the independent role of the barristerand the binding consequences for the client of decisions taken by a barristerin the course of running a case. . . .

The principles as to the role of counsel, and thecapacity of counsel to bind the client, are fundamental to the operation ofthe adversary system, and form part of the practical content of our notions ofjustice.”


	
	There are occasions where the conduct of counsel will not absolve the trial judge from the obligation of intervening, contrary to the parties’ submissions, as part of the obligation to ensure a fair trial, or, as in R v Birks, a conviction will be quashed because there has been found to be a substantial miscarriage of justice.
	
	
	For example, a trial judge might be obliged to leave manslaughter to the jury as an alternative count to murder when neither the Crown nor the accused wants it to be put, although it is open on the evidence: see the discussion in Lane v R [2013] NSWCCA 317 at [35]- [42] about the duties on trial judges. Further, there is, as the High Court said in James v The Queen at [33], almost always an obligation on the trial judge to direct a jury that it is incumbent on the prosecution to negative a defence or partial defence. Thus where there is evidence to support a defence or partial defence, the trial judge is generally obliged to give the direction, irrespective of the views of counsel.
	
	
	The present case involved neither alternative verdicts, nor defences or partial defences, but two separate counts. The sole reason for the separate counts was that s 29D of the Crimes Act had been repealed and replaced by subs 135.4(5) in the Criminal Code. This exceptional circumstance, while it did not alter the requirement for the jury to be satisfied of each count beyond reasonable doubt, had the potential to create a distraction from the real issues in the case, which had been defined by the way it had been conducted.
	
	
	In my view, the trial judge’s answer to the jury’s question indicated a justifiable concern that the jury not be distracted by the fact of the two counts, when the trial had been conducted as if there were one (and would have been but for the change in the law).
	
	
	However, the legally correct and complete answer to the question would have been to direct the jury that, although as a matter of law they could bring in different verdicts, there was nothing in the evidence or in the way the trial was run that would warrant the jury differentiating between the two counts. It would not have been sufficient for the judge merely to have answered the question by telling the jury that, as a matter of law, it was open to them to return different verdicts on the two counts. The duty of the judge is also to direct on the evidence. Had he given the legally correct answer, it would also have been necessary to have directed the jury on the evidence, inter alia, pointing to the dishonesty of the transactions (and that pointing to the knowledge of the appellant) with respect to each count. This would have entailed reference to the circumstances and the nature of each transaction (all of which which were plainly dishonest). Such directions could only have highlighted matters relevant to the appellant's state of mind and could not have assisted his defence on either count.
	
	
	In my view, the trial judge’s failure to give what I consider to be the legally correct and complete answer to the jury’s question amounts to an error of law although neither the appellant’s legal representative, nor Mr Johnston, sought that the trial judge remind the jury of the legal requirement that they consider each count separately. I am persuaded that leave under rule 4 ought be granted but I would dismiss the appeal against conviction for the reasons given above.
	


Appeal against sentence


	
	The appellant relies on the following two grounds:
	


1.   The sentences imposed upon the appellant give rise to a justifiable grievance when compared to the sentences imposed upon his co-conspirators, Agius and Zerafa.

2.   An accumulation of one year’s imprisonment for count one is manifestly excessive.

The Sentence hearing


	
	The Crown tendered a pre-sentence report in respect of the appellant which recounted his personal circumstances. He is married and has fathered four children from three previous relationships or marriages, who were, as at 2 November 2012, aged between 12 and 30. He has a close relationship with his wife, with her children, and with his own. His two eldest children are employed by HCH Industrial Services, a company which he founded. John Murtas, the author of the pre-sentence report opined that the appellant did not appear to have any criminogenic needs or pose any particular risks which could be addressed by the Probation and Parole Service. Mr Murtas noted that the appellant presented as a hard-working, self-made individual who had achieved a substantial degree of business success.
	
	
	The Crown also tendered an Agreed Statement of Facts, on the basis of which Mr Daley pleaded guilty to the two counts (with which the appellant was also charged) and a transcript of the sentence proceedings in respect of Mr Daley. The Crown provided materials on sentence to indicate the various sentences imposed on persons associated with the scheme.
	
	
	Several references were tendered on behalf of the appellant. Their authors, who included both his wife and also the mother of one of his children, wrote of the appellant’s honesty and integrity at a personal and professional level and his sense of responsibility towards his family and the employees of the company he founded. His present accountant wrote that the appellant’s only assets consisted of his superannuation of approximately $90,000 and a motorcycle worth about $10,000.
	


Remarks on sentence


	
	Jeffreys DCJ recounted the provisions that formed the basis of each of the two charges and noted that in respect of the first count there was a maximum penalty of imprisonment for twenty years and in respect of the second there was a maximum penalty of ten years. His Honour referred to R v Ronen [2006] NSWCCA 123 in which this Court upheld a finding that the diminution of the maximum indicated a change in attitude on the part of the legislature.
	
	
	His Honour addressed the substance of the two counts and said:
	


“In reality what was alleged against each offender by the Director of Public Prosecutions was a single continuous conspiracy that spanned the period from about 5 July 2000 to 20 March 2006. In my opinion, there is no difference between the two charges.”


	
	His Honour referred to Part 1B of the Crimes Act, the factors to be taken into account under s 16A(2), as well as general deterrence. His Honour took into account delay and referred to R v Agius; R v Zerafa [2012] NSWSC 978 at [125]-[126] per Simpson J.
	
	
	His Honour found the following facts on the basis of which he sentenced the appellant.
	
	
	The appellant and Mr Pritchard participated in a scheme set up and promoted by Mr Agius which enabled its participants to evade company tax and, in some cases, income tax. It was promoted through an accounting firm, Owen T Daniel, to its clients, who included Mr Daley, the appellant and Mr Pritchard, who were at various times directors and shareholders of HCH, DL and HM. Owen T Daniel prepared annual accounts and lodged income tax returns for the companies.
	
	
	The scheme involved payments from the companies to Uniton in New Zealand. The monies were then transferred through various accounts before returning to Australia to be paid into accounts in the name of HCH, Mr Daley or Mr Pritchard. Monies were deducted in Vanuatu for the benefit of Mr Agius. The scheme required false documents to be prepared in the form of invoices in respect of which the monies sent would appear to be payments. False loan documentation was also prepared to make it look as if the monies being returned to Australia were loan monies. These transactions were recorded in the financial statements of the companies which were attached to their tax returns. The monies paid pursuant to “invoices” were claimed as expenses, thereby reducing the companies’ taxable income.
	
	
	Between 30 December 2000 and 13 June 2004, 35 outgoing payments totalling $2,401,767.30 were made from the companies’ accounts to the New Zealand accounts of Uniton, International Finance Trust Company and Edgecumbe and Southern Hemisphere Insurance Ltd. These payments were variously disguised as management and consultancy expenses, false loan interest payments and insurance premiums.
	
	
	Between 15 December 2000 and 18 August 2004, Edgecumbe and Southern Hemisphere Insurance Ltd made 26 incoming payments totalling $2,153,714 to the accounts of HCH, Mr Daley or Mr Pritchard, which were disguised as personal loans from Edgecumbe. The incoming payments were either retained by Mr Daley or Mr Pritchard and then distributed between Mr Daley, Mr Pritchard and the appellant, and also Mr Britten until 2002, or returned to the companies’ bank accounts and credited to the directors’ loan accounts.
	
	
	His Honour found that, for the period up to 23 May 2001 (count 1), the false deductions amounted to $112,000 producing a tax shortfall of $40,320.
	
	
	His Honour was not satisfied that the appellant or Mr Pritchard knew that the insurance certificate issued in respect of HM was false. Accordingly, his Honour disregarded the insurance aspect on sentence.
	
	
	His Honour noted that, by reason of their convictions, the appellant and Mr Pritchard would be disqualified from managing corporations for five years. His Honour also took into account that the offenders ceased participating in the scheme some years before they were charged. The last payment was made in August 2004 and the HCH tax return for the 2004 financial year (which reflected the false transactions associated with the scheme) was lodged on 5 November 2005.
	
	
	The sentencing judge took into account what his Honour described as the “considerable co-operation” by the appellant and Mr Pritchard in the conduct of the trial. His Honour recounted Mr Pritchard’s personal circumstances and noted that he was 69 years old and in relatively poor health. His Honour recounted the appellant’s personal circumstances in the following terms:
	


“Mr Bennett is 51 years of age. He left school after he completed year 10. Since that time he has been in gainful employment and has involved himself in his industry and has had senior management positions. He is a person of good character. . . He lives with his wife of ten years. He is the father of four children born from three other relationships. The children are aged between 30 and 12.”


	
	His Honour said:
	


“So far as questions of parity and proportionality are concerned the offenders were in fact co-offenders of Mr Daley and Mr Agius and Mr Zerafa.”


	
	His Honour referred to other sentences imposed on the co-offenders:
	



	
		
			
			Name of offender
			
			
			Count 1
			
			
			Count 2
			
			
			Total/ NPP
			
		
		
			
			Agius
			
			
			4 yrs 5 mths
			
			
			4 yrs 6 months
			
			
			8 yrs 11 mths/ 6 yrs 8 mths
			
		
		
			
			Zerafa
			
			
			500 hrs community service
			
			
			3 yrs 6 mths (following Crown appeal)
			
			
			3 yrs 6 mths/ NPP 2 yrs 3 mths
			
		
		
			
			Daley
			
			
			2 weeks
			
			
			3 yrs, 1 mth
			
			
			3 yrs, 1 mth and 2 wks/ 19 mths
			
		
	



	
	The starting point for Mr Daley’s sentence (imposed by Knox DCJ) was 5 years and 9 months, which was then discounted by 45% to take account of the plea of guilty (20%) and assistance to authorities (20%).
	
	
	His Honour noted that there were factors that distinguished the appellant and Mr Pritchard from the co-offenders. Mr Daley had also filed false personal tax returns. Mr Agius was the progenitor and promoter of the scheme; his offending conduct extended for about ten years and at all times the arrangements were under his control.
	
	
	His Honour found that the appellant was unlikely to offend again and referred to his “previously effectively unblemished good character” and “excellent prospects of rehabilitation”.
	
	
	His Honour imposed sentences of four years and nine months on the appellant and Mr Pritchard. The non-parole period in respect of the appellant was two years and four months. It was two years in respect of Mr Pritchard because of his health problems.
	


First ground of appeal on sentence: justifiable grievance when compared with the sentences on Mr Agius and Mr Zerafa


	
	Notwithstanding the general principles of parity and proportionality, care must be taken in drawing direct comparisons between sentences passed: see generally, Hili v The Queen; Jones v The Queen [2010] HCA 45; 242 CLR 520 at [53]- [56] per French CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Crennan, Kiefel and Bell JJ. Sentencing involves the exercise of discretion. The factors that are germane to the exercise of the discretion include deterrence, both general and specific, rehabilitation and punishment. The exercise of the discretion requires consideration of objective circumstances (the seriousness of the offending conduct) as well as subjective circumstances pertinent to the offender. The number of factors to be taken into account provides an indication of the complexity of the task. Although parity is an important principle in sentencing, the sentencing task is not a matter of mathematics. What the plurality (Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ) said in Wong v The Queen [2001] HCA 64; 207 CLR 584 at [65] about the utility of sentencing statistics is also applicable when considering parity and proportionality among co-offenders:
	


“To focus on the result of the sentencing task, to the exclusion of the reasons which support the result, is to depart from fundamental principles of equal justice. Equal justice requires identity of outcome in cases that are relevantly identical. It requires different outcomes in cases that are different in some relevant respect. Publishing a table of predicted or intended outcomes masks the task of identifying what are relevant differences.


	
	The sentence passed on Mr Agius by Simpson J reflected her Honour’s findings of the length of the offending conduct (over 10 years) and its seriousness. Her Honour said at [60]:
	


“. . . Mr Agius in particular was heavily involved in both promoting and implementing the scheme arrangements and in attempting to conceal the true nature of the arrangements after the ATO began its inquiries. . . I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that an accurate description of Mr Agius’ role is that of “promoter”. . . What Mr Agius did was to propose the fraudulent conduct to a number of company directors and provide them with the means of committing the frauds, safe (as they were led to believe) in the knowledge that the documentation would deflect any inquiry by the ATO.”


	
	Simpson J’s approach to sentencing Mr Agius for the two counts appears from the following passage from her Honour’s reasons at [119]:
	


“[119]   Since it is necessary to impose separate sentences in respect of each offence, and since the offences were consecutive, it seems to me to be appropriate to fix sentences relevant to the period over which each was committed, and make the sentences entirely cumulative. I will ensure that the resulting aggregate sentence is equivalent to that I would have imposed had there been a single offence committed over the total period.

[120]   Only two features of the offending mark out the first offence from the second. One is that the period covered by the first offence (4 years and 4 months) is a little less than that of the second (5 years and 5 months). The second is that, in my opinion, the gravity of the frauds escalated with repetition. Other than that, the offences call for approximately equal sentences. That is what I will impose.”


	
	Simpson J said at [123] that the aggregate sentence and the non-parole period equated to what her Honour would have imposed had the offender been liable to a single 10 year maximum.
	
	
	In R v Zerafa [2013] NSWCCA 222, the Court of Criminal Appeal allowed an appeal against the sentence imposed by Simpson J in respect of the second count. Hoeben CJ at CL (Latham and Beech-Jones JJ agreeing) found that his offending conduct continued over seven years, that he actively implemented the scheme and that he was heavily involved with a number of the companies, the maintenance of their accounts and the preparation of fraudulent tax returns. Mr Zerafa also determined and advised the amounts of money which should be sent. After the ATO began inquiries into the scheme he arranged for false invoices to be prepared so as to mislead the ATO auditors and tutored directors in how to explain the invoices to the ATO. The Court of Appeal accepted that there were subjective circumstances that Mr Zerafa was entitled to have taken into account in his favour (his youth, the fact that he was influenced by Mr Daniel’s moral bankruptcy, the fact that he had not gained financially, apart from the continuation of his employment with the firm, both as an employee and partner).
	
	
	In respect of the first count, the sentence passed by Simpson J of 500 hours community service was confirmed. In respect of the second count, the Court of Criminal Appeal imposed a sentence of three years. The Court of Appeal’s approach in this case was influenced by the circumstance that the 500 hours of community service had already been served and therefore any adjustment to the sentence needed to be made to the sentence that Simpson J had imposed for the second count (three years with immediate release on good behaviour).
	
	
	It can be seen from the sentencing of Mr Agius and Mr Zerafa that, although separate sentences were required to be imposed for each offence, the only sensible way of approaching a comparison between sentences is to look at the total sentences imposed because of the relative artificiality of dividing the criminal conduct into two periods by reason of the change in the law on 23 May 2001. Furthermore, the approach taken by Simpson J to regard the ten-year maximum as being the effective maximum for the total sentence removed any anomaly that might otherwise have been caused by taking into account a higher maximum for the first count than was applicable for the second count.
	
	
	In R v Green; R v Quinn [2011] HCA 49; 244 CLR 462 the plurality (French CJ, Crennan and Kiefel JJ) articulated the relevant principle for appellate intervention on the ground of disparity at [31]:
	


“The sense of grievance necessary to attract appellate intervention with respect to disparate sentences is to be assessed by objective criteria. . . The court will refuse to intervene where disparity is justified by differences between co-offenders such as age, background, criminal history, general character and the part each has played in the relevant criminal conduct or enterprise.”

[Footnotes omitted]


	
	Although the sentences imposed on Mr Agius and Mr Zerafa are relevant to those imposed on the appellant and Mr Pritchard in that they were alleged, and shown, to be parties to the same conspiracy, there are significant distinguishing features. Mr Agius was the mastermind of the scheme and his offending was over a greater period. Mr Zerafa implemented the scheme and while he may be taken to have obtained some financial benefit for his participation as an employee and partner of Owen T Daniel, the motive of personal gain was not as apparent in his case.
	
	
	Mr Agius’ sentence was close to the maximum sentence for the offence and reflected her Honour’s assessment that his offending was close to the worst kind for that offence. I do not, in these circumstances, discern any basis for a justifiable grievance on the part of the appellant when the sentence imposed on him is compared with that imposed on Mr Agius. Although the term of Mr Zerafa’s imprisonment was less than that imposed on the appellant, his subjective circumstances were very different: he was young and was, effectively, corrupted by Mr Agius and Mr Daniel. Although he was a willing participant in a dishonest scheme and can be taken to have been rewarded as an employee and partner of Owen T Daniel, his rewards were not shown to be either substantial or the result of greed.
	
	
	The appellant’s total sentence was slightly less than half the maximum of the offence charged in count 2. His offending conduct was perpetrated over five years and involved considerable deliberation and dishonesty. His moral culpability, while less than that of Mr Agius, was considerable. He was a successful business man with a good reputation who, in a calculated and deliberate fashion, engaged in a deception designed to deprive the ATO of funds which it was entitled to receive for the public good. He made no reparation for the substantial loss to the ATO. His reputation for honesty and integrity, to which his several referees attested, rested on a somewhat flawed foundation.
	
	
	I am not satisfied that there is any disparity such as would give rise to a justifiable sense of grievance between the sentence imposed on the appellant and the sentences imposed on Mr Agius and Mr Zerafa. The first ground on sentence has not been made out.
	


Second ground of appeal on sentence: an accumulation of one year’s imprisonment for count 1 is excessive


	
	The approach taken by the sentencing judge was the same as that adopted by Simpson J in R v Agius: namely, to make the sentence for the second count wholly cumulative. Although other approaches may have been open, I do not consider that the approach could sensibly be criticised in circumstances where, although two counts were necessary as a matter of law, the conduct comprised a single conspiracy.
	
	
	Nor do I regard the comparison (which is implicit in the second conviction ground) between the individual sentences imposed on different offenders for counts one and two to be a useful one. In my view, the only meaningful comparison is the one between the total sentences imposed for both counts. In circumstances where there is no disparity between the total sentences, I do not consider there to be any basis for any grievance based on a comparison between individual sentences. The second ground on sentence has not been made out.
	
	
	The appellant does not allege as a separate ground, aside from questions of parity, that the total sentence was manifest excessive. Had such a ground been alleged, it would not have been made out for the reasons given above relating to the length and seriousness of the offending conduct and the maximum sentence.
	


Proposed orders


	
	For the foregoing reasons I propose the following orders:
	



	
	Grant leave under rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules 1952 (NSW) in respect of the first ground of appeal against conviction.
	
	
	Dismiss the appeal against conviction.
	
	
	Refuse leave to appeal against sentence.

2703633,R v AB [2015] NSWCCA 57,"Judgment


	
	SIMPSON J: This is an appeal under s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) by the Director of Public Prosecutions (“the Director”) against asserted inadequacy of sentence.
	


Background


	
	On 10 July 2010 the respondent was arrested and charged with the murder of his former de facto wife earlier that day. On 3 December 2012, after a hearing pursuant to the provisions s 14 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 (NSW) (“the Forensic Provisions Act”) Bellew J found that he was unfit to be tried. A consequence of that finding was that he became a “forensic patient”: see s 3 and s 42 of the Forensic Provisions Act. He was, as is required, referred to the Mental Health Tribunal (“the Tribunal”) for assessment. In accordance with the regime laid down by the Forensic Provisions Act, a special hearing took place before Adams J, commencing in October 2013. At that hearing the respondent did not contest that he had killed the victim. He raised defences under s 23 and s 23A of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) (respectively, provocation and substantial impairment by abnormality of mind). (Strictly speaking, it is inaccurate to refer to provocation as a “defence”. That is because, pursuant to s 23(4), where there is any evidence of provocation, the onus lies on the Crown to prove that the killing was not committed under provocation.)
	
	
	The special hearing before Adams J took place without a jury. On 26 November, Adams J rejected the “defence” of provocation but upheld the defence (properly so called) under s 23A.
	
	
	Section 23A(1) has the effect of reducing an offence that would otherwise be murder to manslaughter if:
	


“(a)  at the time of the acts or omissions causing the death concerned, the person’s capacity to understand events, or to judge whether the person’s actions were right or wrong, or to control himself or herself, was substantially impaired by an abnormality of mind arising from an underlying condition, and

(b)  the impairment was so substantial as to warrant liability for murder being reduced to manslaughter.”

Adams J was satisfied that:

“… the [respondent’s] executive function and judgment and capacity to control himself were substantially impaired by an abnormality of mind arising from an underlying condition within the meaning of [s 23A(1)(a)].” (at [59])

A little later, he found that the requirements of s 23A(1)(b) had also been met. The basis on which he reached these conclusions is relevant to some of the matters raised in the Director’s appeal.


	
	As a consequence of those findings, and in accordance with s 22(1) of the Forensic Provisions Act, Adams J found that, on the limited evidence available, the respondent was not guilty of murder but was guilty of manslaughter. The provisions of the Forensic Provisions Act dictated the sequence of events that followed. The respondent was referred to the Tribunal, and continued to be a forensic patient.
	
	
	Section 23(1) of the Forensic Provisions Act requires that following a special hearing where it is found on the limited evidence available that an accused person has committed an offence, the court must indicate whether, if the special hearing had been a normal trial of criminal proceedings against a person fit to be tried, it would have imposed a sentence of imprisonment, and:
	


“(b)  where the Court would have imposed such a sentence, must nominate a term in respect of that offence, being the best estimate of the sentence the Court would have considered appropriate if the special hearing had been a normal trial of criminal proceedings against a person who was fit to be tried for that offence and the person had been found guilty of that offence.”

A term nominated under s 23(1)(b) is called “a limiting term”. The limiting term marks out the maximum period during which the offender can be held in custody under the Forensic Provisions Act regime (an offender may be released from custody at an earlier stage on the determination of the Tribunal).


	
	Having heard submissions on behalf of the parties, Adams J nominated a limiting term of 7 years, commencing on 10 July 2010 (the day the respondent was taken into custody) and referred the respondent to the Tribunal. It is against that order that the Director now appeals under s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act which permits the Director to appeal to this Court against sentence. For the purposes of s 5D, a limiting term is a sentence against which the Director may appeal.
	


The facts and circumstances of the offence


	
	What follows is largely drawn from the reasons of Adams J for finding the respondent not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter following the special hearing. To a large extent the relevant facts were undisputed.
	
	
	The respondent had lived for some years in a de facto relationship with the victim in a small village called Mooral Creek, approximately 26 kilometres out of the town of Wingham, in country NSW. Together, the respondent and the victim had a daughter, who, at the time of the death of her mother in July 2010, was 7 years of age. Sometime before that date, the victim ended the relationship with the respondent. She and the daughter moved out of the house they had previously shared with the respondent, eventually settling in rented premises in Wingham. There were conflicts between the respondent and the victim. These involved the respondent’s access to their daughter, and complaints made by the victim about the care given to her by the respondent during periods of access. There were conflicts over the division of property, and the respondent suspected the victim of infidelity. There was evidence that, after her departure, the respondent made threats to others to kill either the victim or their daughter. There was also evidence that the respondent had, at that time, been a heavy consumer of alcohol.
	
	
	During the afternoon of 10 July 2010 (a Saturday) the respondent drove to the premises in Wingham by then occupied by the victim and their daughter. Both the victim and the daughter were present. The respondent was in possession of a rifle. He left the rifle in the car, and walked into the premises where he had a conversation (probably confrontational) with the victim. He retrieved the rifle from the car, and returned to the house and shot the victim five times. He then drove off.
	
	
	He drove to his home in Mooral Creek. On arrival there, he rang the emergency number, 000. He had a lengthy conversation with the operator. He immediately told the operator:
	


“Well, I just shot my missus.”

He gave his name and present location, and said that he had shot the victim in Wingham, giving the address. He said that he had shot her three times. The operator asked if he was “Okay” to which he replied:

“Yeah, I am so far but I won’t be when you get here.”

He repeated several times the barely veiled threat to kill himself. He told the operator that his daughter had been present at the time of the killing, and said that she had run down the road. During the course of the lengthy conversation the respondent made remarks (as recorded in the transcript) such as:

“Well the situation was she made a cunt of me, so I shot her. Is that alright?”;

“But what I’m trying to say to you is, listen, it was alright, while she was doing what she was doing but now it’s fuckin’ finished. Alright?”;

“Now, everybody said to me, don’t kill your missus because you’ve got a kid. Well, fuck her too, and I don’t care whether you like it or you don’t.”;

“She must be awful sick ‘cause I put three bullets in her.”;

“Listen, she got three of the best bullets I ever seen in me life.”;

“Now, I don’t really care. All I’m saying, she wasn’t going to rob me no more.”;

“All right? The little one yes, I’m sorry for that but I done it. All right?”;

“Well, because, you know what? They say they get the gold mine, you get the shaft. Like, I’m 64 year old … And it’s not the best thing in the world to do, so fuck her. She - I’m going to end up in the, in the arse of the world. I’ve had three houses. She fucking robbed me of all of ‘em.”;

“Yes, I did shoot her and I hope she’s dead. I hope she fucking is … I hope she’s fucking dead because she’s not going to rob me no more. All right? … I got nothing left … I mean she’s going to rob me of the house and I said, fuck you anyway, and I’m telling you the truth, fuck you anyway, so I went and shot her, you know?”;

“Well, hang on, listen. Everybody said, don’t shoot your woman while the kid’s there … Well, I had no choice. I just walked in and went bang, bang, bang, and that’s the end of you … I said, fuck it I’m going to do it anyway.”;

“So I done, look, it just doesn’t matter what I say to you … The whole fact of is I’ve done it and I feel guilty.”;

“Look … understand this, I went with the intention of killing … I’ve been here fuckin’ 6 months on my own and she’s getting all these benefits and all this shit and I got fuck all … and I said fuck this, and she’s a smart arse, you know?”;

“I know shot her, and I thought the first one didn’t kill her, so I give her a couple more.”;

“Yeah … I hope she’s dead … because, you know, she wanted to rob me for half the house … and, if she died before me, I get nothing.”


	
	A few minutes after this conversation ended, the respondent again rang 000. This call was taken by a different operator. The respondent also told the second operator that he had shot his de facto. He said that he thought he had fired three or four times. He said:
	


“All I’m saying to you is that I shot her and I hope she’s dead.”


	
	The respondent then drove back to Wingham where he was arrested at about 5.20pm. He was interviewed by police. Much of what he said appears to have been inconsistent, but he never resiled from his admission that he had killed the victim. He also continued to make clear that his motivation had been resentment at the victim having left him and having made property and financial demands.
	
	
	He did express some (minimal) concern that his daughter had been in the house at the time of the shooting. In addition to having said that he was sorry about “the little one”, in answer to a question about what he thought when he saw his daughter at the house he answered:
	


“I felt fucking horrible, alright.”

The respondent’s mental state at the time of the killing


	
	The respondent was born in 1945. He was 64 years old at the time of the killing. In 2008 he was diagnosed as suffering from depression and having low self-esteem, and irrational fear. The depression stemmed from a serious injury sustained in 1994. The fear was due to his financial difficulties and back pain.
	
	
	There was psychiatric evidence from four psychiatrists. There was little difference between them. The diagnosis was of adjustment disorder with depressed mood. Adjustment disorder is a reaction to stressors which exceeds the person’s coping capacity, resulting in psychiatric symptoms which either significantly impair function or are greater than might be expected as a reaction to the particular stressor.
	
	
	The respondent was also diagnosed with dementia (probably caused by long term hazardous alcohol consumption), cerebro vascular disease and possible Alzheimer’s dementia.
	
	
	It was on the basis of this evidence that Adams J found the s 23A defence to have been established.
	


The respondent’s health and circumstances following the special hearing


	
	The special hearing took place in October 2013, and Adams J delivered his findings on 26 November of that year.
	
	
	As a forensic patient (from 3 December 2012, when he was found unfit to be tried), the respondent had been referred to and reviewed by the Tribunal. Available to Adams J was a determination of the Tribunal of 17 March 2014 and a report on which it had been based, the source of which appears to have been a clinical nurse consultant (Nurse Parsons). As at March 2014, the Tribunal recorded:
	


“[The respondent] does have a degenerative brain disorder, namely dementia which is irreversible and has resulted in a decline in cognitive function which is continuing.

… [The respondent’s] degeneration brain disorder is irreversible and his cognitive impairment will continue to decline … there is no cure for dementia and there are no disease modifying agents available for [the respondent’s] form of dementia.

…

He appeared physically frail, disinterested and non-communicative before the Tribunal. The opinion expressed by Ms Parsons is that as [the respondent] ages and his memory further declines he may require a more supported environment both for his physical and mental health.

…

The prognosis for dementia is for an ongoing decline in cognitive function …”


	
	A Justice Health report dated 22 February 2014 recorded that the respondent had been assessed by Dr Sharon Reutens, a psychiatrist specialising in the treatment of older people. Dr Reutens recorded that the respondent had been reviewed on 4 February, when he was seated in a wheelchair. She commented, however, that his gait was normal, suggesting that he had some capacity to walk unaided. Dr Reutens’ opinion was consistent with that of Nurse Parsons.
	
	
	At about the same time, Nurse Parsons reported on her assessment of the respondent. Inter alia, she stated her belief that the respondent had little insight into his “illness symptomatology”, although he was aware of his failing memory.
	
	
	There was other medical evidence before Adams J, all to the same effect.
	
	
	Adams J further recounted at [15] that amongst his other physical problems the respondent fell in November 2013 sustaining a right hip fracture which required surgery. His Honour noted that the respondent suffered from continuing severe pain from this injury and may require further surgery. The respondent could walk with the aid of a four wheel walker but needed strong analgesic medication.
	


Reasons of Adams J for nominating a limiting term of 7 years


	
	Adams J briefly reviewed the circumstances of the killing of the victim, and the evidence of the respondent’s mental state. It is only necessary to mention those observations and findings as are material to the grounds of the Director’s appeal. The relevant passages are:
	


“5  … [The respondent] made full and frank admissions to the police. Although he said, in effect, that he had no choice but to kill [the victim] because of her conduct towards him, he also expressed guilt and remorse.

…

7  Were it not for [the respondent’s] mental condition at the time of the offence, this would have been a very serious case of murder …

…

16  … In short, [the respondent] has increasing dementia with severe physical problems which will not improve. He cannot lively independently.

…

17  The most serious feature of [the respondent’s] actions, of course, is his killing of [the victim] in circumstances which, but for his mental state at the time, would have constituted the crime of murder. There can be no doubt that, despite the damage to his powers of reason, self control and judgment he was well aware of the criminality of his actions. Accordingly, there is a significant degree of moral turpitude and criminal culpability involved for which it would have been just that, had he been convicted after trial, a substantial term of imprisonment should have been imposed.

19  It is relevant to consider that [the respondent] will find the prison environment considerably more difficult to cope with than the ordinary prisoner. I note also Dr Reutens’ evidence that the average life expectancy from first diagnosis of dementia is of the order of 10 years but less where hypertension is present (as here) …

20  It is clear that [the respondent’s] mental condition, both as it contributed to the offence, and at present, makes him an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence. I am satisfied that he will not again commit an act of dangerous violence.

…

22  A limiting term that is likely to end after an offender’s understanding of where he or she is and why serves no useful public purpose and is, therefore, pointless …”

The grounds of appeal


	
	The Director has pleaded five grounds of appeal. They are:
	


“Ground 1: His Honour erred by finding that the respondent ‘expressed guilt and remorse’.

Ground 2: His Honour erred by finding that the respondent ‘will not again commit an act of dangerous violence’.

Ground 3: His Honour erred in principle in his statement of a ‘purpose’ of a limiting term.

Ground 4: His Honour erred by failing to make a finding as to the objective gravity of the manslaughter.

Ground 5: The sentence was manifestly inadequate.”


	
	The Director acknowledged that Crown appeals ought to be a rarity (Griffiths v The Queen [1977] HCA 44; 137 CLR 293; Everett v The Queen [1994] HCA 49; 181 CLR 295) and brought for the purpose of laying down principles for the governance and guidance of courts sentencing those who are convicted: more recently stated in Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; 244 CLR 462, citing, inter alia, Griffiths and Everett. The Director proposed that “principles of governance and guidance” must include principles relevant to the avoidance of inadequate sentencing. In my opinion that is a mere generality and does not identify any principle to which this Court should address its attention. In order to succeed, the Director must establish that (in this case) the limiting term nominated was manifestly inadequate - that is, “below the range of sentences that could justly be imposed for the offence consistently with sentencing standards”: Bugmy v The Queen [2013] HCA 37; 249 CLR 571.
	
	
	I now turn to deal with the individual specific grounds pleaded on behalf of the Director.
	


Ground 1: error in finding that the respondent “expressed guilt and remorse”


	
	This ground is founded upon the final sentence in para [5] of the reasons, extracted above.
	
	
	Section 21A(3) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) (“the Sentencing Procedure Act”) sets out mitigating factors which, where relevant and known, must be taken into account in the determination of the appropriate sentence. Sub-paragraph (i) is in the following terms:
	


“(i)  the remorse shown by the offender for the offence, but only if:

   (i)  the offender has provided evidence that he or she has accepted responsibility for his or her actions, and

   (ii)  the offender has acknowledged any injury, loss or damage caused by his or her actions or made reparation for such injury, loss or damage (or both) …”


	
	The point sought to be made on behalf of the Director was that a finding that the respondent was remorseful was not open in the light of the whole of the evidence of what the respondent had said following the killing. On behalf of the Director it was submitted that the respondent was “positively unrepentant”. The Director contrasted the evidence, much of which is set out above, of the respondent almost gloating about what he had done, with the minimal statements of remorse.
	
	
	In my opinion, if it were the case that his Honour had taken remorse into account as a mitigating factor he would have been in error. What the respondent did say that might qualify as an expression of guilt or remorse was very limited - he was sorry that his daughter had been present and (at one point) stated that he felt guilty. These expressions were entirely swamped by the vitriol that attended his tirade to the 000 operator. In any event, they would not meet the requirements of s 21A(3)(i). While what he said might be interpreted as an acceptance of responsibility, there was nothing to suggest that he acknowledged the injury, loss or damage caused (even to his daughter).
	
	
	However, in my opinion, the ground is based upon a misconstruction of what his Honour said. The sentence that concludes [5] could not be said to be a finding of remorse for the purposes of s 21A(3)(i); his Honour simply recorded briefly that the respondent had said that he had no choice but to kill the victim because of her conduct, but had also expressed guilt and remorse. This was not a finding that he was in fact remorseful. It was simply an acknowledgement that the respondent had made some muted expression of guilt and remorse. In my opinion, remorse was not taken into account in the determination of the limiting term. I would therefore reject this ground.
	


Ground 2: the respondent “will not again commit an act of dangerous violence”


	
	This ground is founded upon the passage in the reasons at [20].
	
	
	At first instance, the Crown had urged that the respondent “poses a real risk of reoffending”.
	
	
	The Director maintained that submission on appeal. Reliance was placed on the evidence that the respondent’s dementia is irreversible and will lead to further cognitive decline. The Director referred to evidence that the respondent continued to harbour feelings of resentment towards the victim and towards her family, and that these feelings had not diminished with time.
	
	
	The evidence was that the respondent suffered, not only progressive dementia, but also physical ailments. He appeared physically frail. Although it appears that he had some mobility, he presented to medical appointments in a wheelchair. When seen by Nurse Parsons and Dr Welkee Sim, he walked with the aid of a four wheel walker.
	
	
	At the time Adams J nominated the limiting term, the respondent was one month short of 69 years of age. He had been in custody for 4 years, during which time (it may be assumed) he had abstained from alcohol consumption.
	
	
	In my opinion it was open to his Honour to make the assessment that he did. It may be that the respondent continues to harbour feelings of resentment towards the family of the victim, but his opportunity to translate any such resentment into violent action is, and will remain, virtually nil. I would reject Ground 2.
	


Ground 3: sentencing purposes


	
	This ground is based on the observation by the judge, at [22] of his reasons, in which he stated that “a limiting term that is likely to end after an offender’s understanding of where he or she is and why serves no useful public purpose and is, therefore, pointless”.
	
	
	Since the nomination of a limiting term involves the court in making the best estimate of the sentence it would have considered appropriate, following a normal trial of a person fit to be tried (s 23 of the Forensic Provisions Act), the provisions of s 3A of the Sentencing Procedure Act are applicable. Section 3A identifies the purposes of sentencing as:
	


“(a)  to ensure that the offender is adequately punished for the offence,

(b)  to prevent crime by deterring the offender and other persons from committing similar offences,

(c)  to protect the community from the offender,

(d)  to promote the rehabilitation of the offender,

(e)  to make the offender accountable for his or her actions,

(f)  to denounce the conduct of the offender,

(g)  to recognise the harm done to the victim of the crime and the community.”


	
	On a superficial examination, it may appear that there is some merit in the Director’s contention. The observation by his Honour at [22] concentrates solely on the absence of any purpose to be served by bringing home to the respondent the gravity and consequences of his conduct. It does not mention the other sentencing purposes stated in s 3A. However, it has been held that the purpose of nominating a limiting term is not to punish: R v Mailes [2004] NSWCCA 394; 62 NSWLR 181 at [32]. Accordingly, the first of the stated purposes can be put to one side. It may also be seen that the purposes lettered (b), (c), (d) and (e), also have, in the circumstances of this case, little bearing. Adams J held (and the finding was not challenged) that, by reason of his mental disability, the respondent was an unsuitable vehicle for general deterrence. It follows from the respondent’s progressive dementia, together with the express finding that he would not commit another act of violence, that protection of the community, and rehabilitation, have little (if any) relevance; and there is little to be gained by making an offender suffering from progressive dementia accountable for his actions.
	
	
	Adams J was well aware of the purposes of sentencing stated in s 3A. Section 3A does not call for a ritualistic incantation of those purposes, and an express discarding of those that do not apply to the particular case under consideration.
	
	
	The Director placed particular relevance on the need to denounce the conduct and recognise the harm done to the victim and to her family, as well as to the community. Failure to have regard to those purposes was an error, the Director argued.
	
	
	It seems to me that the denunciation falls into the same category as general deterrence: an offender who is unsuitable, by reason of mental disability, to be a vehicle for general deterrence, is equally unsuitable to be the subject of denunciation. The irrelevance results from the diminished moral culpability, which itself results from the impaired mental capacity of the offender. Recognition of the harm done to the victim, her daughter, and the community certainly had a place in the sentencing exercise. On closer analysis of the reasons, I am not persuaded that that purpose was entirely overlooked. It finds its place in the observations at [7] and [17], extracted above.
	
	
	I would reject this ground.
	


Ground 4: failure to make a finding as to objective gravity


	
	There is no doubt, as the Director contends, that, leaving aside the respondent’s impaired mental condition, this was an objectively serious example of manslaughter. Adams J said as much at [7]. He commented further on objective seriousness at [17]. The killing was certainly not an impulsive act, and had been at least contemplated, if not planned, for some time. The respondent clearly intended to kill the victim. In order to carry out that intention, he had equipped himself with a rifle, and had driven a distance of 26 kilometres. Having confronted the victim, he returned to the car to retrieve the rifle, for the very purpose of using it to kill her. The victim was shot within earshot of her (and the respondent’s) 7 year old daughter.
	
	
	The Director accepted that it can be a difficult task to make a judgment as to the extent to which a mental impairment diminishes responsibility, but urged that, had a proper assessment been made of objective gravity, it would have been apparent that, even allowing for the mental impairment, the crime was a very serious instance of manslaughter. But so much was explicitly recognised.
	
	
	Senior counsel who appeared for the respondent, both at first instance and on appeal, referred to further observations made by the judge during the hearing as to the limiting term to be nominated. Although those observations did not find their way into the reasons formally given, it is clear that his Honour did appreciate the objective gravity of the offence.
	
	
	The Director must go further than merely show that no finding was made. He must show that the failure to make the finding affected the determination of the limiting term. In my opinion he has not succeeded in doing so. The absence of any quantitative finding of objective gravity in the reasons does not impact on the exercise undertaken of identifying the limiting term to be nominated.
	
	
	I would reject this ground of the appeal.
	


Ground 5: manifest inadequacy


	
	In order to succeed on this ground, it is necessary that the Director establish that, in all of the circumstances, the limiting term nominated was unreasonable or plainly unjust: Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357. Having regard to the respondent’s mental state and deteriorating condition, I would not be prepared to reach such a conclusion. The circumstances of this offence bear a marked similarity to the circumstances of R v Zeilaa [2009] NSWSC 532, in which Howie J sentenced the offender to imprisonment for 4 years and 10 months, with a non-parole period of 2 years and 6 months. I would reject this ground of appeal.
	
	
	In my opinion the Crown appeal ought to be dismissed.
	
	
	PRICE J: I agree with Simpson J.
	
	
	McCALLUM J: I agree with Simpson J.

2703634,KAB v R [2015] NSWCCA 55,"Judgment


	
	WARD JA: I have had the advantage of reading in draft the reasons for judgment of Wilson J. I agree that, for the reasons her Honour gives, the application for an extension of time in which to appeal should be refused.
	
	
	SIMPSON J: I have read in draft the judgment of Wilson J, with which, subject to what follows, I agree.
	


Ground 4: denial of procedural fairness


	
	In assessing the objective seriousness of the offence the subject of Count 5 (penile/vaginal intercourse with BS, then aged 17), the sentencing judge said:
	


“Count 5, penile/vaginal intercourse of his seventeen year old stepdaughter, an element of the offence, but an offence wherein he ejaculated inside her, of course putting her at high risk of pregnancy.”

A little later she found:

“… all [offences] bar count 1 fall well above the mid range of objective seriousness.”


	
	There was nothing in the Agreed Statement of Facts that made any reference to the risk or possibility of pregnancy (although, as a matter of common knowledge, penile/vaginal intercourse with a female of BS’s age would, absent some additional circumstance, ordinarily carry such a risk). Nothing was contained in the Crown submissions to suggest that such a possibility was relevant to the assessment of the objective gravity of this offence.
	
	
	In these circumstances, it was complained on behalf of the applicant that the finding amounted to a denial of procedural fairness. The applicant’s complaint was that, had he been aware that the risk of pregnancy might be used in the assessment of objective gravity, he could readily have responded by providing evidence that he had undergone a vasectomy (rendering any risk remote, at most).
	
	
	It is one thing to say that pregnancy is a known risk of penile/vaginal intercourse with a post pubescent female. It is another to take that risk, as an established fact, into account. As it happens (assuming the truth of the applicant’s assertions as to his vasectomy) the risk of pregnancy was not an established fact.
	
	
	I am therefore unable to agree with the conclusions implicit in [77] of the judgment of Wilson J. I am also unable to agree with the observations in [78]. While I am not unsympathetic to the burdens imposed on District Court judges, especially those discharging their functions in country circuits with heavy lists which place significant demands on judges, those burdens cannot be allowed to compromise the sentencing process.
	
	
	In my opinion it was not open to the judge to take into account the “high risk of pregnancy” as an adverse fact or circumstance. This circumstance was unproved by evidence, was not an agreed fact and had not been brought to the attention of the offender as a circumstance escalating the objective gravity of the offence and therefore potentially affecting sentencing.
	
	
	I do not accept that the decision in Toole, Kurt v R; Toole, Joshua v R [2014] NSWCCA 318 provides guidance. In that case, the Crown had expressly, in written submissions, accepted that concurrent sentences could be imposed in respect of the three offences for which the offenders stood to be sentenced. Apparently acting on that concession, senior counsel who appeared for the offenders made no submissions with respect to concurrency or accumulation. Notwithstanding that, the sentencing judge partially accumulated the sentences. That, it was contended on appeal, constituted a miscarriage of justice by reason of denial of procedural fairness. This Court rejected that contention, on two separate bases. The first was that a judge is not required to bring to the attention of parties any disagreement he or she may have with what has been put. At least where offenders are legally represented, that may, for present purposes, be accepted. Counsel representing offenders on sentence are under an obligation to address in respect of relevant sentencing considerations.
	
	
	That is not this case. Here, as I have mentioned above, the asserted denial of procedural fairness concerned a factual matter, that was nowhere in issue, and nowhere mentioned in the sentencing proceedings.
	
	
	The second basis for the result in Toole was that the “concession” made by the Crown was equivocal - it accepted a possibility of concurrent sentences, short of a requirement that concurrent sentences be imposed. That is not here relevant.
	
	
	I have concluded that it was not appropriate for the sentencing judge to take into account, in respect of Count 5, that there was “a high risk of pregnancy”.
	
	
	However, I have also concluded that the error had minimal, if any, impact on the sentence imposed. Against a maximum penalty of 4 years, the applicant was sentenced to imprisonment for a fixed term of 1 year, 8 months and 12 days. Even leaving aside the question of pregnancy risk, the offence was a serious one of its kind. The sentence was specified to commence on the same day as the sentence imposed in respect of Count 4 and was specified to be served wholly concurrent with either that sentence or the sentence imposed in respect of Count 6. There is no portion of the overall sentence that is referable solely to Count 5.
	
	
	There is thus no basis for the exercise of this Court’s re-sentencing discretion.
	
	
	In the circumstances, there is no proper basis on which to grant an extension of time.
	
	
	I agree with the order proposed by Wilson J.
	
	
	WILSON J: The applicant seeks leave to appeal (out of time by a period of almost four years) against sentence imposed upon him by her Honour Judge English sitting at the District Court at East Maitland, on 25 November 2009. Leave is required pursuant to s.5(1)(c) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 to pursue the appeal.
	


The Proceedings in 2009


	
	The applicant was originally charged with a large number of child sexual assault offences. The complainants in each instance were the applicant’s step-daughters. The matter proceeded in the Local Court as a committal for trial and, pleas of not guilty having been entered to the indictment at arraignment, a trial date of 28 September 2009 was fixed.
	
	
	The matter came on for trial but did not immediately proceed. On 30 September 2009, on what would have been the third day of the trial had it commenced as listed, the applicant was arraigned on a fresh indictment containing fewer charges. He entered a plea of guilty to each of the ten charges on the fresh indictment.
	
	
	The indictment spanned a period of about nine years. The ten charges were representative of the applicant’s conduct over that time.
	
	
	The charges against the applicant together with some brief detail of each, and the sentences imposed upon him by the sentencing judge on 25 November 2009, are as follows.

	The effective sentence was an overall period of 13 years, made up of a non-parole period (NPP) of 8 years and 9 months to date from 15 November 2009, and an additional term of 4 years and 3 months. The sentence expires on 15 November 2022.
	
	
	There was a finding of special circumstances, and the overall non-parole period is approximately 67% of the overall total term. There was a degree of concurrency, as is illustrated by the table prepared by the Crown and annexed at the end of this judgment.
	
	
	The facts were before her Honour as an agreed statement. The applicant married the mother of his victims in May 1996, when BS was 8 and EMS was 6 years old. The applicant moved into the children’s family home. He exercised parental authority over them.
	
	
	The children sometimes got into bed with their mother at times when the applicant was also present. He habitually slept naked. The first contact of a sexual nature with the girls was when the applicant took advantage of these occasions to press his naked body up against the children. The sexual touching worsened thereafter, escalating to acts of fellatio and penile–vaginal intercourse, as noted in the table above.
	
	
	When BS and EMS began menstruating, the applicant kept a diary of the relevant dates. Her Honour did not accept the innocent explanation the applicant gave for his possession of these diaries, three of which were found by police.
	
	
	There are five counts relevant to BS which relate to the period in which BS was aged from 11 to 17 years of age. There are also five counts relating to offences against EMS, spanning the period when EMS was also aged between 11 and 17 years of age. The brief details of each count are noted in the table.
	
	
	Late in 2007 the complainants spoke to each other about what the applicant had done to them. They made formal statements to police in October 2008.
	
	
	The applicant was arrested soon after. He was interviewed by investigating police and admitted to acts of both oral and penile-vaginal intercourse with BS, and incidents of digital intercourse and masturbation with EMS.
	
	
	The applicant was 44 years of age when he appeared for sentence. He did not give evidence, but relied upon a psychiatric report from Dr. Olav Nielssen prepared for the purpose of the sentence hearing. The history the applicant gave the doctor included an account of having been sexually assaulted himself as a child, although the applicant told Dr. Nielssen that he did not regard that experience as having any role to play in the commission of the offences. The applicant reported significant use of alcohol since about age 13, and having sought treatment in the past for depression, although without disclosing his offences. The offender had a consistent work history, having been employed as a labourer, prison officer, and council ranger.
	
	
	Dr. Nielssen concluded that the applicant was of normal intelligence, and suffering from chronic low grade depression and alcohol dependence. The doctor recorded the applicant’s acknowledgement that his conduct to his step-daughters had been wrong. He expressed remorse for his crimes to Dr. Nielssen.
	
	
	In sentencing the applicant, her Honour referred to the role he played in the lives of his step-daughter, as a father figure, whom the children should have been able to trust. She noted that the offences had occurred over a lengthy period, commencing when the children were too young to understand the wrongness of the applicant’s conduct, or to resist it. Her Honour concluded that the applicant had “groomed” each of the girls to habituate them to sexualised behaviour, and thus to accept it. She concluded that there was a degree of planning involved and that he had exploited his authority over his victims to obtain their compliance.
	
	
	Her Honour assessed the seriousness of each offence, concluding that each count other than the first fell well above the mid-range of objective gravity.
	
	
	She was not able to conclude that the offender was truly contrite, given that he had disputed parts of what had been tendered as “agreed facts” and had, during his consultation with Dr. Nielssen, appeared to blame the children for the sexual activity. Given the applicant’s lack of insight her Honour could not make any positive finding about the applicant’s prospects of rehabilitation.
	


The Proposed Appeal


	
	The applicant advanced six grounds of appeal, although one ground, ground 5, was abandoned at the hearing of the matter. The grounds are:
	



	
	In sentencing the applicant in respect of counts 1 and 6, her Honour erred in concluding that the standard non-parole period applied;
	
	
	her Honour erred in concluding that the applicant was not entitled to any leniency by reason of his prior good character;
	
	
	her Honour erred in concluding that the fact that the applicant had been sexually abused as a minor should be given no weight;
	
	
	her Honour denied the applicant procedural fairness when she concluded that the objective seriousness of count 5 was aggravated by the fact that the applicant exposed the victim to the “high risk of pregnancy”;
	
	
	[abandoned]; and,
	
	
	The sentence in respect of count 1 was manifestly excessive.
	


Ground 1 – Error in the Application of a Standard Non Parole Period


	
	The applicant contends that her Honour erred in applying a standard non-parole period to counts 1 and 6, wrongly considering that the offences attracted a 5 year SNPP. As the Crown conceded, no SNPP applied at the time of the commission of these offences, the SNPP provisions having been introduced after the commission of the offences, from 1 February 2003. Her Honour was thus in error in that regard.
	
	
	The applicant submits that, because of that error, her Honour “overvalued” the appropriate punishment, with the sentences wrongly inflated as a result.
	
	
	The maximum penalty that applied to these offences was one of seven years imprisonment. Her Honour assessed count 1 as “not the most serious example” of an offence of its kind (AB 32); she assessed count 6 as well above the mid-range of objective seriousness (AB 34). The sentences imposed upon the applicant were,
	


Count 1:   2 years, 6 months and 18 days, with a NPP that was half of the head sentence; and

Count 6:   5 years and 37 days, with a NPP that was half the head sentence.


	
	The sentences themselves are not indicative of “overvaluation” of punishment. That imposed in relation to count 1 was well below the SNPP period of 5 years her Honour mistakenly thought applicable, with a NPP of about 15 months. The sentence imposed for an offence that her Honour had assessed as well above the mid-range of objective seriousness exceeded 5 years by a matter of days, with a NPP of 2 and a half years. Nothing in those figures supports a conclusion that the error as to the applicability of a SNPP was wrongly determinative of the sentences imposed.
	
	
	Additionally, the sentence imposed for count 1 was wholly subsumed in sentences imposed with respect to counts 2 and 3, whilst the sentence imposed for count 6 was wholly subsumed by the sentences imposed for counts 4 and 7. In that sense, the penalties of which the applicant complains were somewhat illusory, since no discrete punishment attached to the crimes reflected by counts 1 and 6.
	
	
	Although error has been established, it did not materially affect the penalties imposed. In my view it could not be said that another, lesser sentence was warranted: s.6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912.
	


Ground 2 – Error in not Extending Leniency for Prior Good Character


	
	As her Honour recognised, the applicant was a person of prior good character, in that he had no criminal convictions. She did not, however, extend any leniency to the applicant to recognise that feature of his case. The applicant complains of error in this regard, relying upon the High Court decision of Ryan v The Queen [2001] HCA 21; (2001) 206 CLR 267..
	
	
	Ryan was similarly a case involving an offender sentenced for child sexual assault offences. The appellant had formerly been a priest, and there was evidence that, in addition to being a person with no former criminal convictions, he had over many years involved himself in charitable works for the good of the community. Despite that, the sentencing judge extended no leniency at all to Mr. Ryan in recognition of his “character, reputation, positive works, and achievements” (at [18]).
	
	
	The applicant relies upon a passage from the judgment of McHugh J at [25] where it was observed,
	


“If an offender is of otherwise good character, then the sentencing judge is bound to take that into account in the sentence that he or she imposes. The weight that must be given to the prisoner's otherwise good character will vary according to all of the circumstances.”


	
	McHugh J gave one of five judgments in Ryan, the others being from Gummow, Kirby, Hayne and Callinan JJ. Although their Honours were generally in agreement about the relevance of evidence of good character, the applicant overstates the effect of the principles involved.
	
	
	In his judgment, McHugh J referred to the relevance of good character in the sentencing context as being capable of suggesting that the offender’s crimes were out of character and thus unlikely to be repeated, thereby going to the prospects of rehabilitation (at [29]). Such evidence could also suggest that a “morally good” person was less deserving of punishment than a “morally neutral or bad” person (at [30]).
	
	
	Reading on in the judgment of McHugh J, it is plain that the two sentences extracted and relied upon by the applicant received a degree of qualification. It is clear that his Honour was not intending to lay down an absolute rule that sentencing judges must always ameliorate the penalty to be imposed upon an offender where that offender is a person of good character.
	
	
	The obligation imposed upon sentencing judges is to “take into account” an offender’s former good character, but the weight to be given to that feature is a matter for the sentencing judge, whose discretion in that regard is wide. As McHugh J said (at [33]),
	


“Sentencing is not a mathematical process. Various factors have to be weighed. The otherwise good character of the prisoner is one of them. It is a mitigating factor that the sentencing judge is bound to consider. But the nature and circumstances of the offences for which he or she is being sentenced is a countervailing factor of the utmost importance [footnotes omitted].”


	
	Evidence of the applicant’s good character was of the absence of any criminal convictions, together with three character references. It did not include, as was the case in Ryan, evidence of good works by the applicant over many years.
	
	
	In determining the sentences to be imposed upon the applicant, her Honour specifically referred to and took into account the fact that the applicant had not previously been convicted of any criminal offences. She then went on to consider the weight to be afforded that feature. Her Honour gave it no ameliorating weight because she considered that the applicant had exploited his character to abuse his two step-daughters repeatedly over a period of many years.
	
	
	Whilst the applicant complains that her Honour was not entitled to rely upon s.21A(5A) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 because not all of the offences before the court were “child sexual offences” as defined by the Act, and because she made no express finding in that regard, it is not certain that her Honour was in fact referring to the operation of that provision, which provides,
	


""In determining the appropriate sentence for a child sexual offence, the good character or lack of previous convictions of an offender is not to be taken into account as a mitigating factor if the court is satisfied that the factor concerned was of assistance to the offender in the commission of the offence.""


	
	Since she made no reference to the section, it seems likely that her Honour was doing no more than balancing the applicant’s good character against the countervailing factors relevant to the exercise of her discretion in determining the weight to be given to character evidence. Those factors included the repeated nature of the offences, the length of time over which the offences had been carried out, the fact that there were two children who had been exploited and abused, and that the commission of the offences represented a grave breach of trust.
	
	
	Having considered those features, her Honour concluded that the absence of criminal convictions was a matter of no significant weight in the circumstances of the case. That was a conclusion available to her in the exercise of the sentencing discretion.
	
	
	The other evidence of good character was the testimonial material. Since her Honour treated this evidence with considerable circumspection, it is useful to provide some detail of it.
	
	
	There were three references for the applicant tendered by him to the sentencing court. [1]  The first was from his mother (not the grandmother of the complainants) who, unsurprisingly, regarded her son as a loving and “family-minded” individual of whom she was proud. It is unclear whether the author was aware of the detail of what the applicant had done; she referred only to the applicant as having “confessed to his wrongdoings”. Since her Honour had the report of Dr. Nielssen in evidence, which recorded the applicant’s denial of some aspects of the agreed facts and his attempt to place blame upon his victims, it was not extraordinary for the sentencing judge to regard this reference as of little or no weight.
	
	
	The second reference, from a short-term employer and friend of seven years shared some of the same difficulties. The author’s information about the offences appeared to have been obtained from the applicant’s “admissions” to him. How complete those admissions might have been was not established in the evidence. The author of the testimonial otherwise regarded the applicant as a compassionate family man. As the sentencing judge noted, it is hard to reconcile this opinion with the objective reality of the applicant’s crimes, diminishing the weight to be given to the document in the circumstances.
	
	
	The final testimonial was from another family member, the husband of an aunt of the applicant. The author of that document referred to the applicant as a trustworthy and capable employee, and a person of integrity. He expressed himself as “blown away” by the charges against the applicant. As with the other testimonials, it is not clear what information the author had as to the charges against the applicant.
	
	
	It was open to the sentencing judge to conclude that evidence of this nature was of very limited weight and, ultimately, that it contributed nothing to a case for clemency in recognition of good character.
	
	
	Her Honour did not fail to take the evidence of good character into account; rather, she considered it carefully, and concluded that it was of insufficient weight as to have any ameliorating impact upon the sentences to be imposed.
	
	
	There is no error in that approach and this intended ground must fail.
	


Ground 3 – Error in not giving Weight to the Sexual Abuse of the Applicant as a Child


	
	As noted above, the applicant told Dr. Nielssen that he had himself been sexually abused as a child over a period of years, by an uncle. The abuse was said to have included anal penetration. No complaint had ever been made to police. The applicant gave no evidence before her Honour, and so the only evidence before the sentencing judge was the hearsay account contained in Dr. Nielssen’s report.
	
	
	Her Honour referred to the issue in her judgment, and noted the potential relevance of the childhood abuse of an offender. She concluded, however, that in the circumstances of the case before her, that the particular feature of the case could have no mitigating effect on sentence. The applicant contends that such a conclusion was simply not open to her Honour, submitting that “there was no material before the court which would have diminished the importance of that earlier abuse”.
	
	
	That submission presupposes that the issue of childhood abuse was in fact of “importance” in the first place. There is no reason to conclude that it was.
	
	
	For a history of childhood sexual abuse to be taken into account as a mitigating feature of an offender’s subjective case, the fact of the abuse must be established on the balance of probabilities, as must a conclusion that the history of abuse was a contributory factor in the offender’s own offending conduct: R v AGR (Court of Criminal Appeal, 24 July 1998, unreported).
	
	
	As to the first criteria, the applicant gave no evidence of the abuse he claimed to have suffered, and his account of it was not able to be tested in cross-examination. That alone meant that her Honour was entitled to treat the claims with some circumspection: R v Qutami [2001] NSWCCA 353; (2001) 127 A Crim R 369 at [58] – [59].
	
	
	Even if the offender’s self report to Dr. Nielssen was sufficient to establish that abuse had occurred, there was nothing before the court to establish its causal connection to the commission of the index offences. Whilst Dr. Nielssen referred to studies suggesting a link between childhood abuse and adult offending, he did not positively conclude that such a link existed in the applicant’s case. Indeed, he recorded without comment the applicant’s statement that he had not believed there to be any link between the abuse he suffered and that which he perpetrated. The applicant described the abuse he experienced as violent and threatening, whilst characterising what he had himself done as taking the affection of his step-daughters for him “the wrong way”, with “one thing leading to another” (AB 53). There is no obvious link to be drawn and, without specific evidence on the point, her Honour was entitled to treat the evidence as she did.
	
	
	The applicant complains that her Honour should have considered the issue of childhood abuse when considering his prospects of rehabilitation but, in circumstances where the evidence did not establish any causal connection between abuse and offending, it is difficult to see why that should be so. If the applicant’s childhood experiences had no relevance to his adult offending, even his determination to seek counselling or treatment relevant to his experiences (something of which there was no evidence) could have had no impact on the prospects of rehabilitation.
	
	
	The weight to be given to the evidence relating to childhood sexual abuse was very much a matter for her Honour. The fact that she accorded it little or no weight is not demonstrative of error, and the applicant has failed to show that there was error in this regard.
	


Ground 4 – Asserted Denial of Procedural Fairness


	
	The sentencing judge concluded that the conduct reflected by count 5 was made more serious because it placed the complainant at risk of pregnancy. Her conclusion in that regard was based upon material in the agreed facts referring to the offence as one involving ejaculation into the vagina of a post-pubescent female.
	
	
	The applicant complains that, in making a finding of that nature, which was adverse to the applicant, and which the Crown had not submitted should be made, her Honour denied the applicant procedural fairness, in that she did not raise the aggravating feature of the risk of the pregnancy with the applicant and give him an opportunity to comment upon it.
	
	
	In support of this ground the applicant seeks to adduce evidence which was not before her Honour of a vasectomy he says he underwent prior to the commission of count 5. Since this is information which was known to the applicant at the time of his sentencing hearing, and which he chose not to place before the sentencing court by way of evidence, there is a question as to whether he should now be permitted to rely upon it: R v Abou-Chabake [2004] NSWCCA 356; (2004) 149 A Crim R 417.
	
	
	Whilst there is an issue as to the admissibility of this material in these proceedings, the applicant’s complaint is of a denial of procedural fairness, and so it is unnecessary to determine whether the evidence should be admitted. To determine this ground, the evidence of the vasectomy the applicant claims to have undergone is largely immaterial.
	
	
	The evidence upon which the sentencing judge concluded that the applicant had exposed BS to a high risk of pregnancy was contained within the agreed facts. The applicant consented to the tender of the statement of facts, which referred to the applicant as having ejaculated into the vagina of BS during the commission of count 5. BS was then aged 17 years. Without any information from any party as to any form of birth control being of relevance, the conclusion her Honour drew was clearly available on the evidence placed before the Court with the applicant’s consent.
	
	
	Two matters are of relevance.
	
	
	Firstly, the risk of pregnancy is a risk which can be said to be ordinarily present in every case where semen is deposited into the vagina of a post-pubescent woman. There should be no surprise in the notion that a sentencing court might have regard to that risk when assessing the objective gravity of an offence, or considering whether any particular feature of its commission aggravated its seriousness.
	
	
	Of all of those present in court during the sentence proceedings, the applicant was in the best position to know that the risk of pregnancy which, on the evidence, appeared to have been a real one, was largely absent by virtue of the surgical procedure he knew he had undergone.
	
	
	Whether or not the Crown had made submissions asking the Court to draw a conclusion about the risk of pregnancy is not determinative of the question of procedural unfairness. The Crown relied upon factual material tendered to the court which in itself supported an inference that there was a risk of pregnancy in relation to count 5. That there was in fact little or no such risk was something known to the applicant. It would have been a simple matter for the applicant to have called evidence about the vasectomy he had undergone. Of course, evidence that a vasectomy had been undergone would not necessarily have wholly eliminated the risk of pregnancy – that would have depended on the efficacy of the procedure in the applicant’s case.
	
	
	Secondly, the circumstances in which sentence was imposed should be borne firmly in mind. The sentencing judge was here sitting at a country circuit sittings of the District Court. Such sittings are characterised by a large number of matters which have to be dealt with in a limited amount of time. Her Honour was probably responsible for hearing not just the applicant’s case, but trials, other sentences, and a wide variety of short matters. It is highly likely, as is usual during circuit sittings in that jurisdiction, that her Honour took the evidence and submissions of the parties knowing nothing about the case prior to its commencement, and then gave sentence at some time (often after 4pm) which would cause minimal disruption to the hearing of trial matters listed during the sittings.
	
	
	The conclusion drawn by her Honour as to there being a risk of pregnancy was an inference available on the evidence, even though the basis on which her Honour concluded that the conduct put the complainant at a “high” risk of pregnancy is not apparent from the material before her Honour.
	
	
	The requirement of procedural fairness has been described in this way in this Court, although in a very different context.
	


“[…] fair procedure requires, at least for important decisions and those critical to the determination of a case, that considerations of importance to the judicial officer’s conclusions should be drawn to the notice of the parties affected or their representatives so that a fair opportunity is presented for contrary argument to persuade the judicial decision-maker to take a different view.”


	
	This passage, from Parker v DPP (1992) 28 NSWLR 282 at 296 is the decision that gave rise to the now well-known “Parker Warning”, that being a warning that an appellate court must give to an appellant where the court is considering increasing a sentence, rather than upholding the appeal or dismissing it.
	
	
	The principle outlined in Parker and the requirement there imposed upon judges hearing appeal matters is of considerably lesser significance in the context of sentence proceedings at first instance.
	
	
	In a recent decision from this Court, Toole v R; Toole v R [2014] NSWCCA 318, a requirement of giving notice to the parties in sentence proceedings of conclusions of significance was regarded as overly burdensome and impractical.
	


“The circumstances in both cases are radically different from those in sentencing proceedings in the District Court. Not uncommonly a judge will have a number of cases before him, hopefully some or all of which will be disposed of during the day. The circumstances of each may be simple or complex. The Crown will often hand up written submissions which may deal with a few or, on the other hand, a myriad of issues and which may or may not contain concessions. Generally defence counsel, but not the judge, will have had those submissions in advance. The Crown may make concessions in the course of oral submissions.

For a judge, who may wish to reserve because of the difficulties of a particular case, or so that he or she can deal with other cases in their list, in those circumstances to be obliged to read or listen to those submissions with a fine tooth comb, so that he or she can comprehensively identify any concessions and bring any with which he or she does or may disagree, to the attention of defence counsel, is to place a burden on the judge that the system cannot, and in my view should not, have to bear. The judge is there to read or listen to what is put before him or her and to decide, in light of the relevant statutory provisions and other law, the sentence appropriate to impose. The representatives of the parties have the obligation to raise matters that argue in favour of their respective clients, they can fairly be assumed to know them (or they should not be practising in the jurisdiction), and in sentencing proceedings I do not believe ""fair procedure requires ... that considerations of importance to the judicial officer's conclusions should be drawn to the notice of the parties or their representatives"".

I do accept that if a judge gives a positive indication that he or she is disposed to adopt a particular argument or approach, and a party or legal representative in reliance on that indication, also adopts a particular course, then the judge will, because of his or her or own conduct, come under an obligation to warn of the possibility of any change of view. To maintain silence when the judge's view has changed is to mislead and is in character no different from representations that are or become misleading in other fields of activity:” Toole v R; Toole v R [2014] NSWCCA 318 at [43] to [45].


	
	The pressures placed on sentencing judges at first instance by a high workload could never prevent this Court from intervening where there has been injustice to a party; such is not the case here.
	
	
	Here, her Honour gave no indication that she subsequently failed to follow that the feature of ejaculation into the vagina was of no significance in determining the gravity of count 5 crime. Nor did she ignore a concession to that effect made by the Crown, since the Crown made no reference to the risk of pregnancy or otherwise in its submissions. Her Honour simply assessed the evidence placed before her by the parties, and sentenced the applicant accordingly. There was no obligation on her Honour to draw to the attention of the parties what would ordinarily be appreciated as an obvious risk of penile/vaginal intercourse.
	
	
	Even if the evidence of the vasectomy the applicant had in 2004 was before the sentencing court, it is unlikely to have made any material difference to the sentence. Whilst ejaculate containing semen carries a risk of pregnancy, thus arguably increasing the seriousness of a particular offence, the depositing of ejaculate which does not contain semen or which cannot result in pregnancy is still a serious matter which is capable of increasing the gravity of an offence. That much is plain from authorities which deal with fellatio involving ejaculation into the victim’s mouth: R v MS [2005] NSWCCA 322 at [16]; R v Oloitoa [2007] NSWCCA 177. Even without the risk of pregnancy ejaculation into a victim’s body is an act which adds to the degradation of the victim, and can heighten the overall seriousness of the crime.
	
	
	In my view, even if it might be said that the inference drawn as to a “high” risk of pregnancy was not open or should have been raised with the parties, no lesser sentence is warranted in law, or could have adequately reflected the gravity of count 5.
	


Ground 6 – the sentence imposed for count 1 was manifestly excessive.


	
	To some extent, the matters referred to above in relation to the first proposed ground of appeal are relevant to this ground. The applicant complains that the sentence imposed – a NPP of 15 months and 9 days with an additional term of the same length – is manifestly excessive.
	
	
	As has been often stated by this Court, to establish that a sentence is manifestly excessive an applicant has to demonstrate that the sentence was unreasonable or plainly unjust: Markarian v R [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at [25]. This has to be established in a context where there is no single correct sentence and in circumstances where sentencing judges are to be allowed as much flexibility in sentencing as is consonant with consistency of approach and the proper application of principle. This Court may not substitute its own opinion for that of the sentencing judge merely because it may have exercised its discretion differently: Vuni v R [2006] NSWCCA 171 at [33].
	
	
	Whilst, as her Honour concluded, count 1 was not the most serious of aggravated indecent assaults, it remained a serious offence of its type involving rubbing the genitals of an 11 year old girl, to whom the applicant was in a position of trust, with the contact involving skin to skin contact. The incident was not isolated, but occurred in the context of repeated acts of a similar nature, thus denying the applicant the leniency that could have attached to a single event.
	
	
	It is also of relevance to note that the sentence that was imposed was wholly subsumed by sentences for other offences, in circumstances where it could not necessarily be concluded that the sentences imposed for the other counts was capable of comprehending the criminality involved in count 1 (Cahyadi v R [2007] NSWCCA 1; (2007) 168 A Crim R 41).
	
	
	A sentence of the order of that imposed could not be said to be unreasonable or plainly unjust in the circumstances that pertained here.
	
	
	This ground must also fail.
	


The Extension of Time for Appeal and the Question of Leave


	
	The time within which an appeal should have been brought expired on 24 February 2010. The Notice of Intention to Appeal was not filed until 21 November 2013.
	
	
	The application for an extension of time in which to appeal, and leave to appeal, is supported by an affidavit from the applicant of 31 October 2013. He asserts that he was not advised about an appeal by his legal representatives after sentence was imposed upon him on 25 November 2009. This assertion is contradicted by the affidavit of the applicant’s then solicitor, who both spoke to the applicant about the prospect of an appeal, and wrote to him on the subject on 30 November 2009. From that evidence it is apparent that the applicant accepted the contemporaneous advice of his lawyers that any appeal was unlikely to be successful.
	
	
	The applicant asserted in his affidavit that he did not pursue an appeal due to impecuniosity and a belief that he would not receive legal aid. As a consequence he did nothing about pursuing an appeal until 4 March 2013, when he filed an application for legal aid, which was subsequently granted.
	
	
	There was then further delay whilst those instructed considered the matter and prepared grounds of appeal.
	
	
	The Crown objects to the extension of time, and submits that leave to appeal should not be granted.
	
	
	The power of the Court to extend the time in which to seek leave to appeal is a discretionary one, and it is unfettered: Arja v R [2010] NSWCCA 190, per Basten JA at [4].
	
	
	In relation to an application for leave to appeal out of time, this Court said in Edwards v R [2009] NSWCCA 199, at [8]
	


“The Court has a discretion with respect to extension of time under s.10(1)(b) Criminal Appeal Act 1912. In exercising that discretion, the Court has regard to the prospects of success on the application for leave to appeal itself: R v Young [1999] NSWCCA 275 at [30] ff. The Court will usually require some satisfactory explanation as to why an appeal was not brought within the time allowed, especially if the delay is considerable: R v Beattie [2000] NSWCCA 201 at [17].”


	
	The delay here has been inordinate, and no adequate explanation for the failure to file a Notice of Intention or Notice of Application within time has been advanced. Whilst the affidavit of the applicant refers (apparently wrongly) to the lack of legal advice available to him at the time of sentencing, and to his subsequent inability to fund an appeal, that does not provide any satisfactory explanation for the extensive delay. The applicant, whilst not a lawyer, is an individual of normal intelligence with a consistent work history. There is no reason to conclude that he was incapable of taking steps himself to file a Notice of Intention to appeal.
	
	
	In R v Lawrence (1980) 1 NSWLR 122 at 148 it was said,
	


“On many occasions, it has been observed by Courts of Criminal Appeal that intending appellants should not assume that delays in filling notices of appeal or applications for leave to appeal, and especially considerable delays, will automatically be excused: see, for example, R v Sunderland (1927) 28 SR (NSW) 26; 44 WN 197; R v Tyrrell (Court of Criminal Appeal, 31st May, 1974, unreported) and R v Waterhouse (Court of Criminal Appeal, 20th September, 1979, unreported). This Court takes the opportunity to emphasize again that it should not be assumed that a failure to give notice of appeal, or notice of intention to appeal, or to furnish proper grounds of appeal within time will be excused. Certainly, where any considerable delay has occurred, exceptional circumstances will be required before the appeal is permitted to proceed.”


	
	No exceptional circumstances have been advanced such that, notwithstanding the delay, the appeal should be permitted to proceed. Those factors tell against a grant of leave.
	
	
	The other consideration for the Court is the question of merit. For the reasons referred to when considering the grounds advanced, I do not consider that the applicant has demonstrated that his proposed appeal has merit.
	
	
	The community has a strong interest in criminal matters being finalised within acceptable timeframes. That is particularly so in matters involving an offence of personal violence (as a sexual assault inherently is); and even more so where the offences were committed against children. In the absence of some compelling explanation for the failure of the applicant to prosecute his appeal within a reasonable period, and having regard to its unmeritorious nature I would not grant an extension of time to the applicant to pursue his appeal.
	
	
	Even had an extension of time been granted, I would not have granted leave to appeal.

		08 April 2015",2015-04-07 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2703640,INSPECTOR PAMELA ESTREICH v ONE STEEL COIL COATERS PTY LIMITED [2015] NSWDC 242,"sentence


	
	One Steel Coil Coaters Pty Limited (the offender) has pleaded guilty to an offence that by its acts and/or omissions it failed to ensure the health, safety and welfare of an employee Thuan Luu contrary to section 8(1) Occupational Health and Safety Act 2000 (the Act).
	
	
	The maximum penalty for the offence is 5000 penalty units ($550,000): section 12(1)(b) of the Act.
	
	
	On the sentence hearing, Ms James appeared for the prosecutor and Ms McDonald SC appeared for the offender.
	


Facts


	
	The parties presented an Agreed Statement of Facts, which can be summarised as follows.
	
	
	From about 2007 the offender operated a business painting steel strips from premises at 3a Contaplas Street, Arndell Park in the State of New South Wales (the site). The offender was one in a group of companies that at the relevant time employed about 40 people.
	
	
	At about 7.10am on 6 April 2011 Mr Luu sustained serious injuries when his arm became caught between two in-running lower turnaround steel rollers on a Primer Coater Machine (the Machine) at the site.
	
	
	On the day of the incident Mr Luu was working in the Primer Coater Room where the Machine was located carrying out tasks related to the operation of the Machine.
	
	
	The Machine applied undercoat paint (primer) to both sides of the raw steel which was fed into it in a continuous sheet, ie a steel coil. There were a number of rollers within the Machine, including two in-running lower turnaround steel rollers on the exit side of the Machine (lower rollers). The lower rollers were not involved in the application of primer but assisted in providing tension and guiding the steel coil through the line. There was a nip point between the lower rollers.
	
	
	The Machine had an interlocked trip bar and an emergency stop pull wire. The interlocked trip bar had been installed in an attempt to alleviate the risk of an inadvertent trip or fall into the Machine by an employee. If activated, the interlocked trip bar stopped the entire line, including the Machine. The emergency stop pull wire, if pulled would stop the entire line including the Machine.
	
	
	Employees working in the Primer Coater Room were required to come into close proximity to the Machine:
	



	
	to view the underside of the strip of metal as it passed through the lower rollers to monitor the coverage and quality of the paint coating; and
	
	
	to clean the lower rollers when paint particles or steel fragments dropped onto the rollers.
	



	
	In order to clean the lower rollers, employees would be required to crouch down in close proximity to them. They were cleaned by applying a chemical spray to the rollers or a rag and applying pressure to the rag to manually remove the paint particles or steel fragments from the surface of the lower rollers, whilst the machine was in operation. Mr Luu’s supervisor accepted that this was a task required of employees working in the Primer Coater Room and that it was a task he had performed himself. Mr Troy Mitchell, an employee who performed the same role as Mr Luu, stated in an interview with the WorkCover Authority on 9 May 2012 that Mr Luu would have only been required to lean into the space where the lower rollers were to undertake work on those rollers when the Machine had been stopped.
	
	
	On the day of the incident at about 7.10am the emergency stop pull wire was activated. When Mr Luu’s supervisor went to investigate he found Mr Luu in the Primer Coater Room unconscious with his right arm caught between the lower rollers. There were no witnesses to Mr Luu’s accident.
	
	
	Mr Luu was freed by emergency services personnel and conveyed to hospital. He later underwent an above the elbow amputation of his right arm. Mr Luu has been unable to return to work.
	
	
	In May 2009, the offender commissioned an independent risk assessment of the guarding of machinery to be undertaken at the site from an appropriately qualified expert, Mr Roger Lim of Planned Safety Solutions Pty Ltd. Mr Lim did not inspect the Machine, but noted that it was similar to the Chemical Coater Machine that he did inspect.
	
	
	The assessment recommended, if reasonably practicable, to fit a guard to the Machine between the lower rollers and to extend the existing guards to prevent access to in-running nip points at the sides of rollers at the entry and exit points (the recommendation). The recommendation was set out in a report from Mr Lim dated 20 May 2009.
	
	
	The recommendation was considered by the Safety Action Plan Team which consisted of the sites Operation Manager, Arthur Crampton and a National Operations Manager who was seconded to the site. The Safety Action Plan Team formed the view that:
	



	
	the foreseeable risk was a risk of inadvertent trip or fall by an operator; and
	
	
	the interlocked trip bar and the emergency stop pull wire were sufficient to minimise that foreseeable risk.
	



	
	In August or September 2009 capital expenditure was made to implement the other matters identified in Mr Lim’s report that were accepted by the Safety Action Plan Team, that included inter alia additional guarding of the Chemical Coater Machine.
	
	
	The operation of the machine was carried out pursuant to a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) dated 25 November 2010, which outlined the tasks required to be and undertaken in the Primer Coater Room. Mr Luu had been trained in the SOP and had signed a Competency Assessment Form which indicated that he could satisfactorily describe the potential areas where nip points could occur and could explain the appropriate controls to eliminate or reduce those risks. The SOP provided:
	



	
	that cleaning of Head 1 (the top lower roller) could proceed while the Machine was running;
	
	
	that cleaning of Head 2 (the bottom lower roller) could not be undertaken without “the line being stopped and locked out by use of the line isolator on the control panel”;
	
	
	that cleaning should only be undertaken when the rollers were in reverse to eliminate the nip point; and
	
	
	that forward coating was when the Machine was in its most dangerous mode because of the nip point created by the operation of the lower rollers.
	



	
	In addition to this formal training, there were toolbox talks conducted on a regular basis relating to health and safety in the operation of the Machine, including on the day of the accident. Mr Luu had four to five years’ experience working on the Machine.
	
	
	In his interview with the WorkCover Authority, Mr Luu stated that on the day of the accident he was squatting next to the Machine and cleaning it whilst it was running. He stated that he undertook this task about three or four times per shift. He stated that on the day of the incident the drum had not been cleaned before the paint was changed. The paint that had dripped onto the roller had hardened on the roller surface and was therefore difficult to remove, requiring him to have his hand in the required position for a long time. He did not make any statement relating to how his arm became entrapped between the lower rollers.
	
	
	In his interview with the WorkCover Authority the Site Manager, Mr Gleeson stated that he never observed Mr Luu cleaning the rollers of the Machine whilst it was running.
	
	
	Shortly after the accident, the offender:
	



	
	installed additional guarding on the lower rollers of the Machine at a cost of approximately $19,785.00; and
	
	
	installed a Fortress Interlocking System through the production line that requires a key to be placed in the central locking system for the Machine to operate. The cost of the interlocking system was approximately $15,443.00 and the cost of the associated electrical works was approximately $20,250.00;
	
	
	revised the SOP to provide instructions to stop the machine prior to any cleaning task being undertaken.
	


The offender’s evidence


	
	The offender relied on two affidavits of Geoffrey Wayne Voigt sworn 26 March 2015 and 30 March 2015. Mr Voigt was cross-examined before me on 31 March 2015.
	
	
	At the relevant time, Mr Voigt was employed by a company within the group as the General Manager Safe Operations Steel. He had been employed in manufacturing management roles for about 29 years prior to being employed in various safety roles for the past 9 years. Mr Voigt has been trained in numerous safety and environmental fields including incident investigation and risk management. He had also received training in 2010 on the Australian Standard relating to machine guarding from Mr Lim.
	
	
	Mr Voigt gave evidence about the circumstances leading to the commissioning of Mr Lim’s report of 20 May 2009. It is sufficient to note that Mr Lim’s report was obtained as a response to an accident where an employee of a related company in the group suffered a hand injury that occurred at a different site. In the circumstances that response was a proactive and wide ranging review of the machinery operated throughout the group and not just of the machinery operated by the relevant company.
	
	
	After the accident Mr Voigt immediately travelled to the site, together with another senior executive. The production line was shut down for two weeks to allow for a full investigation into the accident and to review guarding on the machinery at the site and the relevant procedures. During the investigation process, Mr Voigt spoke to a number of employees and was present whilst various measurements of the Machine were taken.
	
	
	Mr Voigt accepted that the SOP provided that Head 1 could be cleaned while the Machine was running. He pointed out that Head 2 was covered by the steel coil when the Machine was running.
	
	
	Mr Voigt provided primary records held by the offender that established that the line and the Machine would have been stopped to change the gauge of the steel coil at approximately 7.15am on the morning of the accident. In other words, if there was a need to clean one of the lower rollers Mr Luu could have waited about five minutes and completed that task when the Machine was stopped.
	
	
	Mr Voigt gave evidence of his understanding as to how it was anticipated that the employees such as Mr Luu would have attended to cleaning the lower rollers whilst the Machine was running. There were some discrepancies between this evidence, i.e. what the management of the offender anticipated would occur in the course of the cleaning tasks and the description of how the cleaning tasks were actually undertaken as described by Mr Luu and his supervisor in the Statement of Agreed Facts. Mr Voigt’s evidence on this point and the Statement of Agreed Facts were therefore not inconsistent.
	
	
	Mr Voigt was present when employees of the offender attempted to re-enact Mr Luu’s accident as part of the investigation undertaken. Annexure C to his affidavit of 26 March 2015 was a photograph taken of an employee with his arm in the Machine, in the position intended to depict where Mr Luu was found immediately after becoming entrapped in the Machine. The photograph depicted the body of the employee being positioned under both the interlocked trip bar and the emergency stop pull wire.
	
	
	In paragraph 56 of his affidavit sworn 26 March 2015, Mr Voigt set out a series of measurements which were confirmed by photographs annexed to the affidavit and video footage of the measurements being taken. The effect of those measurements was intended to be that:
	



	
	the height of the interlocked trip bar would provide protection to an employee who was crouching in close proximity to the Machine and inadvertently overbalanced towards it; and
	
	
	the nip point was 840mm past the interlocked trip bar, which was longer than the average worker’s arm.
	



	
	Mr Voigt gave evidence that the interlocked trip bar would stop the line and the Machine if it was raised or lowered from its resting position. Mr Voigt gave evidence that the emergency stop pull wire would stop the line and the Machine if light pressure was applied to it in any direction as it was under tension.
	
	
	Mr Voigt concluded that Mr Luu must have taken some deliberate action to access the rollers underneath the interlocked trip bar and the emergency stop pull wire, in order to become trapped in the Machine.
	
	
	I would pause to note at this juncture that Mr Voigt was a very impressive witness. I considered him to be appropriately qualified to express the opinions contained in his affidavits. The fact that the offender chose to express its remorse and contrition through such a senior and experienced member of its organisation was also in my view significant.
	
	
	I will return to other aspects of Mr Voigt’s evidence when considering the mitigating factors to be taken into account relating to this offence.
	


Consideration


	
	Both the prosecution and the offender reminded me of the general principles to be applied in the sentencing process and I have had regard to those matters, which were helpfully set out in the written submissions of the parties.
	


Objective seriousness of the offence


	
	The proportionality principle requires that a sentence should neither exceed nor be less than the gravity of the crime having regard to the objective circumstances: Veen v R (No 2) (1988) 164 CLR 465 at 472, 485-6, 490-1 and 496. At common law, the term “objective circumstances” was used to describe the circumstances of the crime. The gravity of the offence was assessed by reference to its objective seriousness: R v McNaughton (2006) 66 NSWLR 566 at [15].
	
	
	The task requires the court to consider where in the range of conduct covered by the offence the conduct of the offender falls: Baumer v R (1988) 166 CLR 51 at 57. This assessment will generally indicate the appropriate range of sentences available which will reflect the objective seriousness of the offence committed, and set the limits within which a sentence proportional to the criminality of the offender will lie: BW v R [2011] NSWCCA 176 at [70].
	
	
	The sentencing judge should take into account not only the conduct which actually constitutes the crime, but also such of the surrounding circumstances as are directly related to that crime and are properly regarded as circumstances of aggravation or mitigation: R v Wilkinson (No 5) [2009] NSWSC 432 at [61].
	
	
	The existence of a reasonably foreseeable risk to safety that is likely to result in serious injury or death is a factor relevant to the gravity of the offence: Capral Aluminium Limted v Workcover Authority of New South Wales (2000) 49 NSWLR 610 at [89]. The question of forseeability of the risk is to be determined objectively.
	
	
	The risk of injury to a worker such as Mr Luu was reasonably foreseeable because the SOP permitted the cleaning task to be undertaken whilst the Machine was running. I accept that the risk was small but it would nevertheless have serious consequences if it was brought home.
	
	
	Mr Luu suffered serious crush injuries that resulted in an above the elbow amputation of his right arm. Mr Luu, to this point, has been unable to return to work.
	
	
	Having considered the photographs, the measurements and the opinion evidence of Mr Voigt, I accept that in order for Mr Luu to become entrapped in the Machine he had to take deliberate steps to avoid contact with the interlocked trip bar to carry out the task he was engaged in and that his actions were dangerous to his own safety. I am satisfied on the evidence contained in Mr Luu’s statement to the WorkCover Authority that he was trying to diligently and conscientiously clean the Machine whilst it was running.
	
	
	The Safety Action Plan Team when considering Mr Lim’s recommendation identified the foreseeable risk of injury to be an inadvertent trip or fall by an operator and accordingly that the interlocked trip bar and emergency stop pull wire provided adequate protection. Further, the Safety Action Plan Team considered that the provision of further guarding would impede the task of operators inspecting the underside of the strip to monitor the coverage and quality of the primer coating.
	
	
	In my view the Safety Action Plan Team’s consideration was deficient because it did not contemplate the possibility that by permitting at least some cleaning tasks to be undertaken whilst the Machine was running, that an operator may in an attempt to conduct those tasks diligently and conscientiously, take steps to avoid contact with the interlocked trip bar or otherwise put themselves in a position of peril. Further, the later provision of the guarding that is depicted in photographs 29 and 30 of the Prosecution Sentence Bundle indicates to me that the need for the operator to inspect the underside of the strip was not prevented by the guarding, or alternatively if it was prevented by the guarding that it was not an essential element of the process.
	
	
	In the circumstances, the offender’s departure from the standard expected of a reasonable employer in its position was evident but not significant.
	
	
	For these reasons, the objective seriousness of the offence in my view was in the low range.
	


Deterrence


	
	There is a requirement for the penalty imposed in relation to this offence to provide for general deterrence. The penalty should draw attention to persons operating similar businesses, which are inherently dangerous to employees, that it is necessary to ensure that those businesses operate without risk to the health and safety of their employees.
	
	
	In this particular case, the requirement for the penalty imposed to provide for specific deterrence is reduced to the extent that it can be disregarded for the following reasons.
	
	
	First, after the accident the offender took immediate steps to provide further guarding of the Machine and to provide other electrical isolation of the Machine when cleaning work was to be undertaken.
	
	
	Second, the offender by its prior conduct had demonstrated a significant commitment to workplace safety.
	
	
	Third, the offender has provided support to Mr Luu and his family whilst he was in hospital and has provided ongoing counselling and financial assistance to him after that time. The offender has assisted Mr Luu by providing him with a prosthetic limb, modifications to his car and home, driver retraining and extensive rehabilitation, which is likely to result in Mr Luu being able to return to some form of employment.
	
	
	Fourth, the offender through the evidence of Mr Voigt has accepted full responsibility for the incident and expressed sincere remorse and regret.
	
	
	Finally, the offender is no longer operating the relevant business. The business has been sold and the offender has been maintained on the companies register only for the purpose of these proceedings and it will be wound up after their completion.
	


   Aggravating factors


	
	The injury, emotional harm, loss or damage caused by the offence was substantial: section 21A(2)(g) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. Mr Luu suffered serious crush injuries
	


Mitigating factors.


	
	The offender does not have any prior convictions: section 21A(3)(e) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.
	
	
	The offender has demonstrated remorse: section 21A(3)(i) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. Mr Voigt in paragraphs 89 to 91 of his affidavit sworn 26 March 2015 accepted responsibility on behalf of the entire executive and management team of the offender and the group for the accident. He also expressed sincere regret and remorse for the effect on Mr Luu and his family and for the fact that the Act had been contravened. Mr Voigt gave evidence that the accident has reinforced in the offender the need to be “continually vigilant with regard to matters affecting health and safety”. For the reasons I have already expressed I have no hesitation in accepting Mr Voigt’s evidence as being genuine contrition and remorse on behalf of the offender. Further, the offender has acknowledged the injury, loss and damage caused by the offence and has made significant payments towards Mr Luu’s support and rehabilitation that should be considered as reparation for the injury, loss and damage suffered by Mr Luu.
	
	
	The offender was a person of good character: section 21A(3)(f) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. The evidence demonstrated that the offender had a serious commitment to workplace safety. In addition, Mr Voigt gave evidence that the offender contributed to charity events in its local area and that the group made corporate donations on behalf of all of the relevant companies on a structured basis.
	
	
	The offender is unlikely to re-offend: section 21A(3)(g) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. The offender is no longer operating the relevant business, which has been sold.
	
	
	The offender entered a plea of guilty to the Amended Summons at the earliest possible opportunity: sections 21A(3)(k) and 22 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. The offender is entitled to a discount on penalty that reflects the utilitarian value of that plea. The extent of the discount should generally be assessed in the range of 10-25%, but that is only a guide. The primary consideration in determining where in the range a particular case should fall, is the timing of the plea so that the earlier the plea the greater the discount: R v Thomson & Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 and R v Borkowski (2009) 195 A Crim R 1 at [32]. The plea also indicates remorse: Borkowski at [32] The prosecutor accepted that the offender’s plea was an early one. In the circumstances, the appropriate discount for the plea of guilty is 25%.
	
	
	The offender co-operated with the investigation: section 21A(3)(m) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.
	


Capacity to pay a fine


	
	Section 6 Fines Act 1996 provides:
	


In the exercise by a court of a discretion to fix the amount of any fine, the court is required to consider:

(a)   such information regarding the means of the accused as is reasonably and practicably available to the court for consideration, and

(b)   such other matters as, in the opinion of the court, are relevant to the fixing of that amount.


	
	The Court is required to have regard to this provision. Where an offender seeks to have a fine reduced on the basis of a limited capacity to pay, it bears the evidentiary onus of convincing the Court that it should exercise its discretion to limit the amount of the fine.
	
	
	The offender did not put on any relevant evidence.
	


Penalty


	
	Taking all of those matters into account I find the appropriate penalty to be a fine of $60,000. In recognition of the early plea of guilty that sum is to be discounted by 25%.
	
	
	I impose a fine of $45,000.
	
	
	I order that the prosecutor receive a moiety of that fine.
	


Costs


	
	To give effect to the agreement of the parties, I order that the offender pay the prosecutor’s costs in the sum of $30,000.

JUDGMENT


	
	JOHNSON J: By Further Amended Summons (constituted by Supplementary Notice filed on 5 February 2015), the Plaintiff, Deborah Grant, seeks to challenge a decision made in the Casino Local Court on 20 August 2014 refusing leave to withdraw a plea of guilty to a charge of common assault contrary to s.61 Crimes Act 1900.
	
	
	The Plaintiff seeks leave to appeal under s.53(3)(b) Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 or, in the alternative, prerogative relief in the nature of certiorari under s.69 Supreme Court Act 1970. Both avenues are limited to questions of law alone.
	
	
	The First Defendant, the Local Court of NSW, filed a submitting appearance in the proceedings. The Second Defendant, the Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW), appeared in the proceedings to contest the claim for relief.
	


Grounds of Appeal


	
	The Plaintiff relies on the following grounds of appeal:
	



	
	Ground 1 - the Magistrate applied the wrong principles of law when considering the Plaintiff's application to withdraw her plea of guilty.
	
	
	Ground 2 - the Magistrate failed to give adequate reasons for dismissing the application.
	


Factual Background


	
	On 7 December 2012, the Plaintiff was convicted in this Court of hinder investigation of a serious indictable offence contrary to s.315(1)(b) Crimes Act 1900. She was sentenced by Bellew J to 12 months’ imprisonment wholly suspended on the condition that she enter into a good behaviour bond pursuant to s.12 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999: R v Grant [2012] NSWSC 1491.
	
	
	On 7 October 2013, the Plaintiff was charged with common assault of her ex-partner contrary to s.61 Crimes Act 1900.
	
	
	On 23 October 2013, the Plaintiff appeared before the Casino Local Court represented by Ms Claire Hilton who entered a plea of not guilty to the charge. The matter was stood over for hearing on 23 January 2014.
	
	
	On 23 January 2014, the Plaintiff, represented by Mr Philip Crick, entered a plea of guilty to the charge and the matter was stood over for sentence.
	
	
	In accordance with usual practice, the breach proceedings before Bellew J were to be determined first: Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v Cooke [2007] NSWCA 2; 168 A Crim R 379 at 388 [28].
	
	
	On 18 June 2014, the Plaintiff was called up before Bellew J for breach of the s.12 bond. During the course of the Plaintiff's evidence under cross-examination, she provided an account of the incident giving rise to the charge of common assault, which appeared to call into question her plea of guilty. As a result, Bellew J adjourned the hearing to allow the Plaintiff to obtain further legal advice as to the course that she wished to take in relation to the charge before the Local Court.
	
	
	On 20 August 2014, the Plaintiff applied unsuccessfully for leave to withdraw her guilty plea before Magistrate Heilpern in the Casino Local Court. It is this decision which is the subject of the present appeal.
	


The Application for Leave to Withdraw the Plea of Guilty before the Local Court


	
	Before moving to the grounds of appeal, it is appropriate to set out parts of the reasons of the Magistrate declining to grant the Plaintiff leave to withdraw her plea of guilty. In doing so, it should be kept in mind that the judgment constitutes an ex tempore decision delivered at the conclusion of an interlocutory hearing in the Local Court. Further reference will be made to this aspect in determining the second ground of appeal.
	
	
	Placed before the Magistrate on the application to withdraw the plea were an affidavit of the Plaintiff sworn 9 July 2014 and an affidavit of Mr Crick sworn 7 August 2014. No oral evidence was given on the application. The matter proceeded by way of submissions by reference to the documentary material.
	
	
	His Honour commenced his decision by noting that the leading authority was the judgment of Howie J in Wong v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) [2005] NSWSC 129; 155 A Crim R 37 (“Wong”).
	
	
	Referring to the decision in Wong, the learned Magistrate noted that the onus lay upon the Plaintiff to establish that leave to withdraw the plea should be allowed, and that what must be shown is “a good and substantial reason on the balance of probabilities for varying a plea”. His Honour observed that “such matters ought be dealt with with a caution bordering on circumspection”.
	
	
	The learned Magistrate continued (T2.20, 20 August 2014):
	


“What must be shown Is that it was not a free and voluntary confession, or the plea of guilty was not attributable to a genuine consciousness of guilt, or that the plea was induced by threats or impropriety. That is not a closed definition of the circumstances, but it does cover the issues that are being raised. Firstly there is self-defence being raised and that is the basis upon which the plea needs to be changed or is sought to be changed, and the second reason that is given, is that as I understand it, the plea of guilty was entered into on the day of hearing, because the defendant was not - was concerned about what could happen if her children were called to give evidence in the matter.

In essence, those two overlap, but of course the fear of having your children being called to give evidence is not a defence as it were, to any eventual charge, but it certainly is a relevant factor to be taken into account in a change of plea, where it is indicated that self-defence is to be relied on.

In essence, the real test is whether or not the plea of guilty was a matter of free choice or not. At or about para 37, Howie J talks about pleas of convenience and says in effect that if an applicant takes advice that is given, enters a plea of guilty as a result of a free choice to do so, as to what is in his or her best interests, then that admission of guilt ought to be taken on face value, again I am paraphrasing, I do not have the judgment in front of me.”


	
	The learned Magistrate then continued (T2.42, 20 August 2014):
	


“In this case, what is clear is that the defendant, the applicant, had legal advice on several occasions from Mr Crick, both in the initial plea and also on the day of hearing. It is true that it was made clear to the applicant that she either, if she pleaded not guilty then he was not going to represent her because she had not followed up her Legal Aid, but of course not being represented is not a reason to - is not given as the reason that a plea of guilty was entered into. That advice was not only given on the first day, it was also given by telephone the day before the hearing and also at court, this court the following morning, on the day of the hearing ‘I've decided to plead guilty.’ Mr Crick then says he   says words to the applicant:

'You understand if you plead guilty you're accepting the facts as they are in the facts sheet, if you want to dispute the facts then you need to lodge the Legal Aid Review Committee form and seek an adjournment for a disputed fact hearing.’

Ms Ward (as said) [the Plaintiff] said, ‘I just want to plead guilty and get this over with’, Mr Crick said ‘even if you plead guilty today, the matter won't be finalised today because the Supreme Court suspended sentence will be called up and we should ask for a pre-sentence report’.”


	
	His Honour then proceeded in the following way (T3.13, 20 August 2014):
	


“There are two comments that I would make in respect of Mr Crick's advice there. It is (a) correct, (b) the adjournment would have been almost inevitable had there been an appeal lodged, pursuant to section I think 14 of the Legal Aid Commission Act, and in the end an adjournment would have been granted. But the reason given to Mr Crick on the day was ‘I want to get it over with, I want to plead guilty.’

That incidentally is consistent with the evidence that is given in evidence-in-chief [of the Plaintiff] in the Supreme Court, namely question 45:

‘Q. In terms of hitting him [the Complainant], what are the reasons you hit him?

A. I lost it.

Q. You don't say he was about to hit you on this day, do you? 

A. No.

Q. So you're not claiming you acted in self-defence?

A. Not really.

Q. When he touched you, did that bring up a memory of what had occurred in the relationship? A. Yes.’

In other words, what was being built up by Mr Ozen, acting for the applicant in the Supreme Court on the breach of her s 12, was factors in mitigation. There was nothing in examination-in-chief that indicated that she was not guilty. Mr Ozen of course is very experienced Counsel, I have no doubt that if at any time he had been instructed that the defendant viewed herself as not being guilty, then that would have been raised, instead it is only when the Crown Prosecutor begins to ask questions in leading cross-examination that he says - he introduces the whole concept of self-defence, and says ‘are you saying you acted in self-defence’ and effectively the applicant just agrees with that.”


	
	His Honour then turned to the stated basis of the application (T3.47, 20 August 2014):
	


“I am informed now that she wishes to change her plea because of the fact that the - she wishes to claim she acted in self-defence.

I note further that the issue of self-defence was never raised with Mr Crick, nor was it ever raised with Mr Crick that she had concerns about her children giving evidence, but whatever concerns she had about her children giving evidence then, no longer exist quite clearly because she now wishes to plead not guilty, which may or may not result in her children giving evidence, but now she is determined to do that.”


	
	His Honour referred to the context in which the issue had emerged before the Supreme Court (T4.7, 20 August 2014):
	


“Of course what I am entitled to assume throughout this legal mess, there is one thing that is really clear, and that is that she is fighting for her liberty in the Supreme Court, in breach of a s 12 bond. That is the truth of it, and of course if she is not guilty of the offence of common assault that comes before this court then she is not in breach of the s 12 bond and she does not go to gaol on that. And that is, reading between the lines, one of the reasons why I need to view the application with caution, bordering on circumspection.”


	
	His Honour then concluded the judgment in the following way (T4.15, 20 August 2014):
	


“Having read all of the material and made the above comments, I am not satisfied that there are good and substantial reasons for the plea to be allowed to be withdrawn. The reasons for that are that the plaintiff had legal advice, fulsome legal advice about her options. She did not raise self-defence at any time with her previous legal representative, she did not raise self-defence in her evidence-in-chief before the Supreme Court and the issue with her daughters no longer seems to be playing on her mind. As a result, the application is dismissed.”

Ground 1 - Alleged Failure to Apply Correct Legal Principles

Submissions of the Plaintiff


	
	The basis of the Plaintiff's application before the Local Court to withdraw her plea of guilty was an assertion that she had pleaded guilty to the common assault charge because she feared that if her daughters were called to give evidence to support her case, that she committed the assault in self-defence, they would be in danger of harm at the hands of her ex-partner.
	
	
	Mr Bruce SC, for the Plaintiff, submits that the Magistrate applied a ""strict interpretation"" of Wong at 46 [37] to resolve the Plaintiff's application, without having regard to the general principles of law on the issue referred to in the preceding paragraphs of that judgment.
	
	
	Howie J said in Wong at 46 [37]:
	


""But if the Plaintiff by taking the advice proffered to him, entered the plea of guilty as a result of the exercise of a free choice in what he believed to be his best interests at the time, and if, when he entered the plea, he understood that he was admitting his guilt of the offence to the court, it does not follow that a miscarriage of justice would arise by refusing the application simply because he maintains his innocence of the charge and has always done so, or because he now regrets taking the advice. As Dawson J stated in Meissner in the passage quoted above, a miscarriage will normally only arise in that situation where the defendant did not understand the nature of the charge or did not intend by his plea to admit his guilt of it.""


	
	The Plaintiff submits that this was not the issue that the Magistrate had to decide. The issue at hand was, on the Plaintiff's submission, whether the plea of guilty ""was not really attributable to a genuine consciousness of guilt"" on the basis that it was overborne by a concern for her daughters.
	
	
	The Plaintiff submits that on the day she changed her plea to guilty, she was not given appropriate advice from her legal representative, Mr Crick, as to the calling of her daughters to support her claim that she was acting in self-defence, as he made no enquiries of the Plaintiff as to what her defence was.
	
	
	The Plaintiff further submits that the affidavits of the Plaintiff and Mr Crick, which were before the Local Court, differed on substantive issues and that his Honour made no definitive findings on the credibility of either the Plaintiff or Mr Crick.
	
	
	The Plaintiff submits that there was no evidence before his Honour which contradicted the Plaintiff's affidavit evidence as to her pleading not guilty before the Local Court, and that her daughters were witnesses to the incident. The Plaintiff submits that this evidence was confirmed to a great extent in evidence given on oath before Bellew J in the Supreme Court.
	
	
	The Plaintiff takes issue with parts of the Magistrate's remarks, including his Honour's finding that ""she did not raise self-defence at any time with her previous legal representative, she did not raise self-defence in her evidence-in-chief before the Supreme Court and the issue with her daughters no longer seems to be playing on her mind"" (see [21] above).
	
	
	In relation to these remarks, Mr Bruce SC submits that:
	


""There is no reference in these remarks to the instructions that the Plaintiff gave Ms Hilton as set out in paragraph 2 of her affidavit. The Magistrate either completely ignored them or failed to properly read the Plaintiff's affidavit. True it is that Mr Crick (according to his affidavit) gave the Plaintiff advice as to her options up to and on the day the matter was listed as a defended hearing but that advice only went to her representation on the day and what the effect would be if she pleaded guilty. No appropriate advice was provided in any way in relation to what the Plaintiff's defence may have been, which was significant bearing in mind that the matter had been expedited as a defended hearing because it was a 'domestic violence' related matter…""

Submissions of the Second Defendant


	
	Ms Davidson, counsel for the Second Defendant, submits that the Magistrate's approach to the application was in fact entirely consistent with the general principles governing an application for leave to withdraw a plea of guilty.
	
	
	Counsel submits that the Magistrate:
	


""[H]ad noted various formulations of principle relevant when an application to withdraw a plea raises those issues, referring to whether the plea was attributable to a genuine consciousness of guilt or induced by threats, as well as to whether it was a free and voluntary confession, adding that this was not a ‘closed definition of the circumstances’.”


	
	Ms Davidson submits that the Magistrate's reference to the issue of free choice being the ""real test"", which the Plaintiff takes issue with, indicates that his Honour was appropriately concerned with the two matters raised by the Plaintiff which could potentially affect the integrity of her plea. That is, the issue of self-defence and the Plaintiff's alleged concern for the safety of her children. Counsel submits that the Magistrate's ultimate concern was, correctly, whether a ""good and substantial reason"" to allow the Plaintiff to withdraw her plea had been made out.
	
	
	In relation to the alleged deficiency of the legal advice provided by Mr Crick, the Second Defendant submits that the totality of the evidence before Magistrate Heilpern on that issue did not raise doubt as to the integrity of the plea.
	
	
	In relation to the Plaintiff's submission that she entered the guilty plea out of fear for her daughters' safety, the Second Defendant submits that his Honour did not err in his application of principle. Counsel submitted that it was open to the Local Court to take the view that the evidence did not establish that the Plaintiff held such fear for her daughters' safety as to induce her guilty plea and so as to provide a ""good and substantial reason"" to allow the plea to be withdrawn.
	


Consideration


	
	The principles governing an application to withdraw a plea of guilty are well settled. In R v Wilkinson (No. 4) [2009] NSWSC 323; 195 A Crim R 20, I summarised those principles as follows at 27-28 [41]-[48]:
	


""41   There is a well-recognised discretion to allow a person leave to withdraw a plea of guilty, at least prior to conviction: Maxwell v The Queen (1995-1996) 184 CLR 501; Wong v Director of Public Prosecutions (2005) 155 A Crim R 37; R v Rae (No. 2) (2005) 157 A Crim R 182; [2005] NSWCCA 380; Norvenska v Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) [2007] NSWCCA 158.

42   The Court may, in the exercise of discretion, grant leave to a person to withdraw a plea of guilty at any time before sentence is passed: Griffiths v The Queen (1977) 137 CLR 293 at 334-335; Maxwell v The Queen at 522. Each case must be looked at in regard to its own facts and a decision made whether justice requires that such a course be taken: R v Davies (1993) 19 MVR 481; R v Lars (1994) 73 A Crim R 91 at 109-110.

43   The onus lies upon the Applicant to demonstrate that leave should be granted: R v Marchando (2000) 110 A Crim R 337 at 338 [4]; R v Toro-Martinez (2000) 114 A Crim R 533 at 536-537 [16]-[23]. The Applicant must establish a good and substantial reason for the Court taking the course of granting leave to withdraw the plea: R v Sewell [2001] NSWCCA 299 at [39]; Wong v Director of Public Prosecutions at 46 [39]. An application to withdraw a plea of guilty is to be approached with caution bordering on circumspection: R v Liberti (1991) 66 A Crim R 120 at 122; R v Parkes [2004] NSWCCA 377 at [48]. 

44   The plea of guilty itself is a cogent admission of the ingredients of the offence: R v SL [2004] NSWCCA 397 at [51]. Indeed, it has been described as the most cogent admission of guilt that can be made: Charlesworth v R [2009] NSWCCA 27 at [25]. 

45   On an application for leave to withdraw a plea of guilty, the question is not guilt or innocence as such but the integrity of the plea of guilty: R v Rae (No. 2) at 188 [21].

46   A person may plead guilty upon grounds which extend beyond that person's belief in his guilt, and the entry of a plea of guilty upon such grounds nevertheless constitutes an admission of all the elements of the offence, and a conviction entered upon the basis of such a plea will not be set aside on appeal unless it can be shown that a miscarriage of justice has occurred, and this will normally only arise where the accused person did not understand the nature of the charge, or did not intend by his plea to admit his guilt of it: Meissner v The Queen (1995) 184 CLR 132 at 157; Wong v Director of Public Prosecutions at 45-46. Although these principles were expressed in the context of an appeal, the same principles apply where application is made at first instance for leave to withdraw a plea of guilty.

47   Where an application is made for leave to withdraw a plea of guilty, evidence ought be adduced from the accused person as to the circumstances in which he or she came to plead guilty: Wong v Director of Public Prosecutions at 40 [14].

48   The various circumstances identified by Spigelman CJ in R v Hura (2001) 121 A Crim R 472 at 478 [32] provide assistance where application is made for leave to withdraw a plea of guilty. These are:

(1)   Where the Appellant ‘did not appreciate the nature of the charge to which the plea was entered’ (R v Ferrer-Esis (1991) 55 A Crim R 231 at 233).

(2)   Where the plea was not ‘a free and voluntary confession’ (R v Chiron (1980) 1 NSWLR 218 at 220 D-E).

(3)   The ‘plea was not really attributable to a genuine consciousness of guilt’ (R v Murphy [1965] VR 187 at 191).

(4)   Where there was ‘mistake or other circumstances affecting the integrity of the plea as an admission of guilt’ (R v Sagiv (1986) 22 A Crim R 73 at 80).

(5)   Where the ‘plea was induced by threats or other impropriety when the applicant would not otherwise have pleaded guilty ... some circumstance which indicates that the plea of guilty was not really attributable to a genuine consciousness of guilt’ (R v Cincotta, NSWCCA, 1 November 1995 (unreported)).

(6)   The ‘plea of guilty must either be unequivocal and not made in circumstances suggesting that it is not a true admission of guilt’ (Maxwell v The Queen (supra) at 511).

(7)   If ‘the person who entered the plea was not in possession of all of the facts and did not entertain a genuine consciousness of guilt’ (R v Davies (1993) 19 MVR 481. See also R v Ganderton NSWCCA 17 September 1998 (unreported) and R v Favero [1999] NSWCCA 320).""


	
	It is for the Plaintiff to demonstrate error of law before either of the forms of relief sought may be granted in this case. This Court is not undertaking a rehearing of the application for leave to withdraw the plea of guilty.
	
	
	Ground 1 asserts that the Magistrate applied the wrong principles of law in considering the Plaintiff’s application. I am not persuaded that this is so. His Honour had a clear understanding of the relevant principles with the judgment to Howie J in Wong being of assistance in this case.
	
	
	The Plaintiff’s complaint that his Honour erred in the findings challenged at [30] above, does not rise above a claim of factual error. It does not constitute error of law. In any event, his Honour’s focus was upon the circumstances surrounding the entry of the plea of guilty on 23 January 2014. The Plaintiff appreciated what was involved in her plea of guilty. Further, as the Magistrate noted (at [18] above), the Plaintiff conceded on oath that she had hit the Complainant other than in self-defence.
	
	
	It was open in law to his Honour to conclude that the Plaintiff had failed to demonstrate good and substantial reasons to allow the plea of guilty to be withdrawn.
	
	
	No error of law has been demonstrated in this respect and the first ground of appeal should be rejected.
	


Ground 2 - Alleged Failure to Give Reasons

Submissions of the Plaintiff


	
	The Plaintiff submits that the Magistrate's reasons for refusing the application for leave to withdraw her guilty plea failed to address the case put forward in the application and, as a result, were inadequate.
	
	
	Particular emphasis was placed on the decision in Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v Elskaf [2012] NSWSC 21 (“Elskaf”) in support of the proposition that Magistrates have an obligation to provide adequate reasons for their findings as part of their judicial function.
	
	
	The Plaintiff drew the Court's attention to the following statement of Garling J in Elskaf at [58]:
	


“The mere statement that a witness' evidence is unreliable, without any analysis as to why that was so, or any analysis of, in this case, the nature and context of the challenge to the witness evidence, is not sufficient to discharge a magistrate's judicial obligation to give reasons.""

Submissions of the Second Defendant


	
	Ms Davidson submitted that his Honour's reasons for refusing the Plaintiff's applications are not lacking in clarity or sufficiency to warrant interference by this Court.
	
	
	The Second Defendant points to the fact that his Honour's remarks constituted an ex tempore decision on an interlocutory matter in a Local Court. This Court was directed to a number of authorities for the proposition that appropriate allowance should be made for the pressures to which Local Court Magistrates are subject (Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v Illawarra Cashmart Pty Limited [2006] NSWSC 343; 67 NSWLR 402; Acuthan v Coates (1986) 6 NSWLR 472; L v Lyons [2002] NSWSC 1199; 56 NSWLR 600).
	
	
	In any event, the Second Defendant submits that the Magistrate's reasons were sufficient:
	


""A fair reading of his Honour's reasons indicates that…he identified the two issues raised in the Plaintiff's case. He gave reasons for his findings in relation to each. He made reference to the inconsistent approach taken by the Plaintiff at different times in relation to both issues. His Honour's reasons make clear his view of the improbability of the Plaintiff's case in light of those inconsistencies"".

Consideration


	
	A failure to give reasons as required by law may itself constitute error of law. In Moloney v Collins [2011] NSWSC 628, I said at [63]-[65] (in the context of a civil hearing in the Local Court):
	


“63   Failure to give reasons as required by law may itself disclose error of law: Pettitt v Dunkley [1971] 1 NSWLR 376; Soulemezis v Dudley (Holdings) Pty Limited (1987) 10 NSWLR 247 at 278-279. However, the extent and content of the reasons required will depend upon the particular case and the issues under consideration. 

64   The duty does not require the trial Judge to spell out in minute detail every step in the reasoning process or refer to every single piece of evidence. It is sufficient if the reasons adequately reveal the basis of the decision, expressing the specific findings that are critical to the determination of the proceedings: Stoker v Adecco Gemvale Constructions Pty Limited [2004] NSWCA 449 at 41. It is essential to expose the reasoning on a point critical to the contest between the parties: Pollard v RRR Corporation Pty Limited [2009] NSWCA 110 at [58].

65   Appropriate allowance should be made for the pressures under which Magistrates are placed by the volume of cases coming before them: Director of Public Prosecutions v Illawarra Cashmart Pty Limited [2006] NSWSC 343; 67 NSWLR 402 at 407-408 [15]-[18].”


	
	An application to permit a person to withdraw a plea of guilty is interlocutory in nature: Wong at 39-40 [10].
	
	
	A Magistrate would be entitled to refuse to entertain a further application for an interlocutory order such as this that had already been determined by the Court, unless there was significant new material justifying the Court exercising its discretion afresh on the basis that, without new material, the further application would be fruitless: Hall v Nominal Defendant [1966] HCA 36; 117 CLR 423 at 440-441; Wong at 39-40 [10]; Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v Scheibel [2004] NSWCA 187; 145 A Crim R 576 at 584-585 [51]-[57].
	
	
	The decision of the Magistrate in this case involved an ex tempore judgment delivered immediately after the interlocutory hearing at the Casino Local Court. No doubt, the application was one of many matters listed before the Court on that day. Some allowance must be made for ex tempore reasons delivered on an interlocutory issue: Re Don [2006] NSWSC 1125 at [39].
	
	
	In considering appeals on sentence where remarks on sentence were delivered ex tempore immediately following the sentencing hearing, the Court of Criminal Appeal has stressed the need for a practical approach to be taken. In R v Speechley [2012] NSWCCA 130; 221 A Crim R 175, the Court said at 180-181 [34]-[35]:
	


“34   In doing so, it is necessary to keep in mind that the remarks on sentence were delivered ex tempore immediately following the sentencing hearing on 3 February 2012. This course had the undoubted advantage that those present in Court could hear immediately the sentence which was passed and his Honour’s reasons for passing that sentence. A consequence of this approach, which is understandable in a busy court, is that remarks on sentence may not be ‘as robustly structured as they might otherwise have been’ (Simpson J in Simkhada v R [2010] NSWCCA 284 at [24]) and may ‘lack the order and precision of language that can be incorporated into a judgment after the luxury of time for consideration, refinement of expression, and polishing’ (Simpson J in Rotner v R [2011] NSWCCA 207 at [57]). 

35   When considering whether error has been demonstrated in the ways alleged by the Crown, it will be necessary to fairly read his Honour’s remarks on sentence, bearing in mind the features of an ex tempore decision.”


	
	In R v Hamieh [2010] NSWCCA 189, the Court said at [32]:
	


“It is important to recognise, therefore, that there is a practical tension between the principles requiring oral reasons, delivered in plain English and with brevity (usually in a busy list) and the need for reasons to satisfy the requirements of the law in the particular case. Remarks on sentence are frequently delivered ex tempore and, as the Chief Justice has observed in R v McNaughton [2006] NSWCCA 242; 66 NSWLR 566, at [48] 577:

‘The conditions under which District Court judges give such reasons are not such as to permit their remarks to be parsed and analysed’.”


	
	It is important to keep statements of this type in mind, in particular when considering submissions that the Magistrate in this case erred in law in failing to give reasons as required by law.
	
	
	It is not the duty of a Judge or Magistrate to decide every matter which is raised in argument. The decision of a particular submission may be an essential part of the reasoning towards the Magistrate’s final conclusion. It is not open to a party on appeal to complain that reasons were not given for the decision of a matter of fact or law which was, or must have been, decided, if the matter was not the subject of submissions made to the court below in a way which called for a reasoned consideration of them: Housing Commission of New South Wales v Tatmar Pastoral Co Pty Limited [1983] 3 NSWLR 378 at 385-386.
	
	
	In my view, reading fairly the entirety of the Magistrate’s reasons, the issues falling for consideration were addressed by his Honour. In particular, I accept the submission of the Second Defendant referred to at [47] above. It has not been demonstrated that the Local Court failed to give reasons as required by law.
	
	
	Once again, it is necessary to keep in mind that this is not a rehearing of the application for leave to withdraw the plea of guilty. That application was considered by the Magistrate at Casino Local Court and determined in the manner outlined in this judgment. No error of law has been demonstrated in that respect.
	
	
	The Plaintiff has not made good the second ground of appeal.
	


Conclusion


	
	The Plaintiff has failed to demonstrate error of law on the part of the Magistrate. Accordingly, the foundation for relief, in each of the alternative ways sought by the Plaintiff, has not been established.
	
	
	At the hearing, the Court was informed that the parties had agreed that there should be no order as to costs, whatever the outcome of the proceedings.
	
	
	I make the following orders:
	



	
	extend time to 5 February 2015 to institute an application for leave to appeal under s.53(3)(b) Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 against the order of the Magistrate of 20 August 2014;
	
	
	grant leave to appeal against the order of the Magistrate of 20 August 2014, but dismiss the appeal;
	
	
	dismiss the Further Amended Summons (as constituted by the Supplementary Notice filed on 5 February 2015);
	
	
	no order as to costs of the proceedings.

2703646,Sio v R [2015] NSWCCA 42,"Judgment


	
	​LEEMING JA:  A jury acquitted Mr Daniel Sio of the murder of Mr Brian Gaudry, but convicted him of one count of robbery in company causing wounding or inflicting grievous bodily harm, contrary to s 98 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW).  The maximum penalty was 25 years of imprisonment.  Adamson J sentenced him to a term of imprisonment of seven years and six months, with an additional term of two years and six months. He seeks leave to raise two grounds of appeal against his conviction, namely:
	


 


	
	The trial judge erred in admitting into evidence the electronically recorded interview with Richard Filihia conducted on 24 October 2012 and the statement of Richard Filihia dated 25 October 2012.
	
	
	The verdict was unreasonable and cannot be supported by the evidence. 
	


 


	
	I have concluded that leave should be granted, but the appeal dismissed.
	


Overview of facts


	
	The essential facts were as follows. Mr Brian Gaudry died as a result of a stab wound inflicted by Mr Richard Filihia, a co-offender who pleaded guilty to murder and armed robbery.  Mr Gaudry worked and was killed at a brothel in Clyde in western Sydney, to which Mr Filihia was driven by Mr Sio in a red Holden Commodore.  A friend of Mr Sio, Ms Sarah Coffison, also known as “Sam”, was in the vehicle at the time.  Mr Filihia entered the brothel alone, armed with a knife (more is said below about the evidence linking the knife to Mr Sio).  An altercation between him and Mr Gaudry led to Mr Gaudry being stabbed and his subsequent death.  Mr Filihia then removed a pencil case from Mr Gaudry’s back pocket which contained cash.  He left the brothel and ran past Mr Sio’s car.  Mr Sio started his car, caught up with Mr Filihia, picked him up and accelerated sharply away from the scene.
	
	
	Parts of the foregoing (Mr Sio’s vehicle being driven on a motorway to the brothel, and Mr Filihia approaching the brothel and in its reception) were captured on CCTV footage.  Images were rapidly distributed to police stations throughout Sydney.  Mr Filihia reported to the police station at Hurstville in the early evening of the same day (by reason of a condition on the grant of bail for an unrelated offence).  He had shaved his head, presumably in an effort to avoid detection.  However, police recognised him, he was arrested, and participated in an electronically recorded interview lasting about 90 minutes.  That recording became exhibit E and the transcript exhibit F.
	
	
	During the interview Mr Filihia consistently maintained that there was only himself and another man in the car.  For the most part, he said that the man was called “Jacob”.  However, at one stage he described the man as “Dan”:
	


 

A352: And I just, I told her that I was just looking for Dan.

Q353: Looking for who?

A: Jacob.

Q354: Did you just say looking for Dan?

A: No, no …. Man, sorry about that ….

Q355: ‘Cause I mean obviously I’m hoping you’re being honest with us ---

A: Yeah, yeah, no.

 


	
	At the end of the interview, Mr Filihia agreed to participate in an identification parade.  That procedure was also electronically recorded.  That recording, in which Mr Filihia identified Mr Sio as the man, Dan or Danny, who was the driver of the car, became exhibit J and the transcript exhibit K.
	
	
	Mr Filihia prepared a supplementary statement on 25 October 2012 which became exhibit H, in which he said:
	


 

On Wednesday 24 October 2012, I was arrested at the Hurstville Police Station in relation to the murder of Brian Gaudry.  I was interviewed electronically by Detective Sergeants Scott and Rudens in relation to the murder where I admitted that I had gone to the brothel to rob it and when I did this, I stabbed the manager.  I mentioned in the interview that I was driven there by a man I knew as “Jacob” in his red Holden Commodore.

I would like to correct what I said in this interview and say that Jacob’s real name was Danny or Dan. …

I know Danny works as a security guard in the city for a family business and that he owns and drives a red Holden Commodore that is a new model.  There is nothing that I can remember that stands out about this car.

As I said in the electronic interview, it was Danny who put me up to robbing the brothel.  He gave me the knife and drove me there.  He explained to me the layout and told me the money etc.  The plan was for me to rob the brothel and for us to split the money fifty fifty.  Danny told me the money was in a pencil case in the manager’s back pocket.

I was not completely honest during my interview about Danny by saying his name was Jacob because I didn’t want to come over as a rat.  I also know Danny’s mobile number is 0426 [XXX] 278.

 


	
	Mr Filihia had pleaded guilty, but had not been sentenced, by the time of Mr Sio’s trial.  He was a witness in the Crown case.  However, he refused to take an oath or affirmation or to answer any questions at all relating to the matter, even after receiving advice from pro bono counsel as to the consequences of his silence, and being cautioned that he risked punishment for contempt of court.
	


The primary judge’s ruling on the two recordings and statements


	
	The Crown then sought a ruling on a voir dire that the electronically recorded interviews of 24 and 25 October and Mr Filihia’s two statements be admitted on the basis that their maker was not available.  Her Honour heard argument on 9 September 2013 and delivered a ruling on the following day: R v Sio [2013] NSWSC 1412.  Her Honour’s reasons were fairly described by Mr Sio as “comprehensive”.  It was common ground that Mr Filihia was not “available” within the meaning of s 65(1) of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW), and no point was taken about the failure to comply with the notice requirements of s 67.  The Crown relied on the exclusions to the hearsay rule in paragraphs (b) and (d) of s 65(2) in the alternative.
	
	
	The defence submitted that the representations (a) were not against interest, (b) were made when Mr Filihia was affected by drugs, (c) were not likely to be reliable and were likely to be fabrications, and (d) should be excluded under ss 135 and 137 even if admissible under s 65(2)(b) or (d).  Her Honour did not need to determine the Crown’s application insofar as it relied on s 65(2)(b) (her Honour considered it arguable:  at [51]), but admitted Mr Filihia’s statements and electronically recorded interviews under s 65(2)(d).  Her Honour’s reasons for doing so are reproduced later in these reasons.  Her Honour rejected the defence submissions under ss 135 and 137, on the basis that any unfair prejudice could be addressed by appropriate directions.  In due course, her Honour gave directions warning of the potential unreliability of the untested evidence.
	
	
	The challenge on appeal was limited, in at least six respects.  First, no challenge was made to her Honour’s findings under s 65(2)(d)(i), that the statements and interviews were “against the interests” of Mr Filihia or that Mr Filihia was “not available”.  This accorded with what had been held in R v Suteski [2002] NSWCCA 509; 56 NSWLR 182.  Secondly, no challenge was made on appeal (as had been made below) that Mr Filihia was under the influence of drugs when participating in the interview.  Thirdly, no challenge was made to the admission into evidence of the second electronically recorded interview (that involving the identification of Mr Sio).  Fourthly, no challenge was made to her Honour’s rejection of the defence submissions under ss 135 and 137.  Fifthly, there was no challenge to her Honour’s directions to the jury.  Sixthly, the Crown did not seek to re-agitate its submissions under s 65(2)(b).
	
	
	Attention on appeal was accordingly focussed on s 65(2)(d)(ii).  Mr Sio submitted that the finding that the representations were made in circumstances that make it likely the representations were reliable should be set aside.  Her Honour addressed this at [55]-[61] of her reasons, which should be reproduced in their entirety:
	


 

55   The representations were made on the same day of the incident at a time when Mr Filihia was not necessarily expecting to be apprehended
and interviewed, although he must have appreciated that there was a substantial risk of apprehension.  His answers were, in the main, forthcoming.  I did not detect any indication that he had rehearsed, or thought out, how best to present the facts in order to advance his interests by minimising his involvement.  His recollection can be taken to be fresh by reason of the short time between the events and the interview.

56   His response at the end of the interview to the request that he take part in an identification parade provides a further indication that he had decided to be as forthcoming as possible in order to assist him on sentence.  He was asked whether he wanted to take part at Q 672, following which the exchange occurred:

A672 Should I or shouldn't I?

Q673 It's up to you, you're not obliged to.

A Would it help me out in court or would it be - - -

DETECTIVE SERGEANT SCOTT

Q674 That's not up to [us to] say, mate.

A Yeah.

[Emphasis added.]

57   His preparedness to answer questions thoughtfully and apparently without regard to self-incrimination is evident from the ERISP.  He was quietly spoken and courteous throughout and appeared to answer willingly.  Although he gave a false name, Jacob, for Mr Sio, his dissembling was neither clever nor, apparently, pre-meditated, since he gave Mr Sio's mobile phone number, which he had memorised.  He described the colour and make of the car Mr Sio was driving.

58   He answered Q648:

""Do you mind if we wrap this up soon boys?""

59   This answer was given after Mr Filihia had been shown the stills from the CCTV which the Crown tendered on this application.  He appeared to be substantially affected by what he saw and by the knowledge that the man he had stabbed was dead.  He was asked by police whether he wanted a break at Q651, to which he answered:

""No, no, no, no just, I just feel, I just feel sad, I just feel yeah.""

60   By the time Mr Filihia had expressed a wish to have the interview over, he had been questioned for about one and a half hours, during which he had answered about 700 questions relating to what had occurred that morning.  In these circumstances his desire to have the interview over does not, in my view, reflect any unwillingness to be forthcoming.

61   I am satisfied, by reason of the matters referred to above that the circumstances make it likely that the representations are reliable within the meaning of s 65(2)(d) of the Act.

 

Ground 1 – the 24 and 25 October recordings and statements – s 65(2)(d)


	
	Mr Sio submitted that “it was not open to her Honour to come to the view that the challenged evidence was made in circumstances that make it likely that it is reliable”.  In support of this, Mr Sio pointed to the considerations that (a) Mr Filihia wished to keep police from discovering the presence of Ms Coffison, (b) he wished to have revenge upon Mr Sio, (c) he had had much of the day in order to plan a deception upon the police, and (d) he wished to seek assistance from the police.  Mr Sio further submitted that even if Mr Filihia’s remarks in respect of his own involvement in the robbery were reliable, “it did not logically follow that what he said about the involvement of others was reliable”.
	
	
	The written and oral submissions on appeal were brief (that is no criticism of them).  However, a proper consideration of those submissions requires attention to be given to the text and purpose of s 65, its legislative history, and the body of law that has developed around it.
	


(a) Section 65: overview


	
	Section 65 prima facie permits hearsay evidence to be adduced in a criminal trial which cannot be tested by cross-examination because the maker is not “available”.  Thus the section necessarily “cuts across long standing rules of engagement in criminal trials”, as Hidden J observed in R v SSA [2007] NSWSC 111 at [22].  However, three protections remain.  The first is in the terms of the section itself.  The second is that s 65 only makes hearsay evidence prima facie admissible; it remains subject to the general exclusionary provisions such as ss 135 and 137 in Part 3.11.  The third is the right to a direction to the jury, if requested, under s 165(2).
	
	
	Section 65(2) contains four gateways, in paragraphs (a)-(d), at least one of which must be satisfied in order for the hearsay rule not to apply.  Although this appeal directly concerns only the fourth gateway in paragraph (d), assistance may be gained from having regard to all four paragraphs, for at least two reasons.  The first is that there are textual links between the four paragraphs which bear upon the matters central to this ground of appeal: the meaning of “made in circumstances” in (b), (c) and (now) (d), and the graduated assessment of probability (“make it unlikely”, “make it highly probable” and “make it likely”).  The second is that a consideration of all four paragraphs reveals insights into the structure of the section as a whole, and therefore the proper construction of paragraph (d).
	


(b) The amendment of s 65 in 2009


	
	Some of the decisions on s 65 are on the same statutory language, but in the form it took prior to amendment by the Evidence Amendment Act 2007 (NSW), Schedule 1, item [27], with effect from 1 January 2009.  The purpose of that amendment was, expressly, to raise the threshold for prima facie admissibility under paragraph (d).
	
	
	As originally enacted, s 65(2) took the following form:
	


(2)   The hearsay rule does not apply to evidence of a previous representation that is given by a person who saw, heard or otherwise perceived the        
        representation being made, if the representation was:

(a)   made under a duty to make that representation or to make representations of that kind, or

(b)   made when or shortly after the asserted fact occurred and in circumstances that make it unlikely that the representation is a
        fabrication, or

(c)   made in circumstances that make it highly probable that the representation is reliable, or

(d)   against the interests of the person who made it at the time it was made.

 


	
	The presently relevant paragraph (d) was amended, so as to narrow it, following this Court’s decision in R v Suteski [2002] NSWCCA 509; 56 NSWLR 182, as may be seen most clearly from ALRC Report 102, chapter 8, paras 8.38-8.58.  Suteski raised essentially the same issue as that arising in this appeal: should s 65(2) render statements made by a person who is complicit in an offence which are against his or her own interests prima facie admissible against the accused, even if he or she is unavailable?
	
	
	Suteski was a case where the Crown alleged murder as a participant in a joint criminal enterprise, and applied to tender an electronically recorded interview by Mr Sakisi.  The interview was made before Mr Sakisi was convicted, but by the time of Mr Suteski’s trial, Mr Sakisi was serving the sentence imposed on him for his part in the same attack which led to Mr Suteski being charged.  Like Mr Filihia, Mr Sakisi refused to give evidence, despite being warned that he risked punishment for contempt.  This Court said that s 65(2)(d) was available “without any requirement for the court to be satisfied that it was highly probable that the representations were reliable” (at [87]) and rejected a submission that the protections from subsections (3), (4) and (5) should be read into subsection (2) (at [91]).  The Court also rejected a submission that the recording should be dissected such that each question and answer should be considered separately and measured against s 65(2)(d): at [93].
	
	
	An application for special leave to appeal was refused.  The Australian Law Reform Commission together with the New South Wales Law Reform Commission summarised this as follows at paragraph 8.47 of ALRC Report 102 (footnotes omitted):
	


 

In the hearing of an application for special leave to appeal to the High Court, counsel for the appellant in Suteski argued that s 65(2)(d) should be read as requiring some assurance of reliability.  The application was unsuccessful, with Gleeson CJ stating, ‘[i]f the ultimate safety net is [Part 3.11], then you do not need to torture the language of section 65’ to read in some assurance of reliability.

 


	
	That background led the Commissions to consult and to propose an amendment to replace paragraph (d) by a more stringent requirement.  The report states (footnotes omitted):
	


 

8.40    The NSW Court of Criminal Appeal held that the trial judge had not erred in admitting into evidence representations made in the police interview as evidence of the truth of the facts asserted in those representations.  The Court noted that counsel for the appellant, at trial and on appeal, had acknowledged that the Crown had taken all reasonable steps to compel the witness to give evidence and that the trial judge had regarded that acknowledgement as a recognition that the sanction of contempt was unlikely to make the witness change his mind.

8.41    The decision in Suteski has provoked concern about allowing the admission of previous representations from a person complicit in an offence to be used against a defendant who does not have the opportunity to cross-examine that person.

…

8.48    While the admission and use of evidence from an accomplice or co-accused can be controlled by ss 135–137, amendment of s 65(2)(d) has the advantage of excluding evidence that carries such a risk of being unreliable.  A rule making it inadmissible unless it meets some criteria of trustworthiness is warranted.  Evidence of that quality should not be prima facie admissible.

8.49    A submission is made that, by introducing a second limb to s 65(2)(d), the proposed amendment introduces unwanted complexity.  The same submission says that the proposal obscures the relationship between s 65(2)(d) and (c).  Paragraph (c) applies where the representation was ‘made in circumstances that make it highly probable that the representation is reliable’.  No harm appears to result from any overlap between the various paragraphs.  Further, there might not be overlap.  Paragraph (c) requires it to be ‘highly probable’ that the representation is reliable, while the new component of paragraph (d) would only require it to be made in circumstances that make it likely the representation is reliable.  As to introducing further complexity to s 65(2), the Commissions take the view that the amendment is relatively simple and clear.  A safeguard of the proposed kind is necessary to avoid the outcomes described above.

8.50    While the recommendation is directed specifically to address problems concerning the evidence of an accomplice or co-accused, it involves an amendment to a provision of broader application: obviously, statements against interest can arise in other situations.  However, amendment of s 65(2)(d) seems a simpler solution than drafting a new provision dealing specifically with the evidence of accomplices, which might unnecessarily introduce complexity into the Acts.

8.51    The Commissions recommend that s 65(2)(d) be amended to require the representation to be made against the interests of the person who made it at the time it was made and in circumstances that make it likely that the representation is reliable.  The intention is to ensure that the hearsay rule is not lifted where a statement against interest is made in circumstances that would not suggest reliability.

 


	
	Section 65(2)(d) was amended in accordance with the Commissions’ recommendation.  It now provides:
	


The hearsay rule does not apply to evidence of a previous representation that is given by a person who saw, heard or otherwise perceived the representation being made, if the representation:

...

(d)    was:

(i)    against the interests of the person who made it at the time it was made, and

(ii)    made in circumstances that make it likely that the representation is reliable.

 

(c) Analysis of s 65


	
	The following matters emerge from the text, structure and history of the provision.
	
	
	First, it is plain that paragraph (d) should be construed so as to impose an additional hurdle upon the prima facie admissibility of firsthand hearsay evidence of a representation against interest whose maker is unavailable.  No longer is it sufficient to say that the unavailable maker made a representation against interest, as was held in Suteski; it is necessary as well to satisfy (d)(ii), which requires an assessment of reliability.
	
	
	Secondly, the new test in (d)(ii), “make it likely”, is less onerous than the pre-existing wording in paragraph (c), “make it highly probable”.  The textual difference between the new (d)(ii), immediately following the existing (c), is pronounced.  On ordinary principles of construction, a difference in text usually yields a different legal meaning:  see for example Gardner v The Queen [2003] NSWCCA 199 at [43].  That, in turn, means that even if it be concluded that the circumstances are such that there is a real, non-negligible chance that the representation is unreliable, such that it is not “highly probable” that it is reliable and therefore outside paragraph (c), it may still be “likely” that it is reliable and fall within paragraph (d).
	
	
	Thirdly, each of paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) (in its amended form) requires the Court to assess the circumstances in which the representation was made, with a view to assessing whether the representation is reliable.  Those paragraphs are not directed to any particular asserted fact, but instead to the reliability of the representation considered as a whole:  R v Ambrosoli [2002] NSWCCA 386; 55 NSWLR 603 at [28] and [34]-[35]; see also R v Robertson [2015] QCA 11 at [58]-[64], where Ambrosoli was followed in respect of the same language in s 93B of the Evidence Act 1977 (Qld).  The circumstances to be assessed extend to later statements or conduct (for example, an express retraction or a statement that the matter could not have been the relevant matter).  In Ambrosoli, Mason P, with the agreement of Hulme and Simpson JJ, emphasised that the words in s 65(2)(b) and (c) are directed to the circumstances of the making of the representation.  That accords with the fundamentally different roles of judge and jury in a criminal trial, to which Spigelman CJ referred in R v Shamouil [2006] NSWCCA 112; 66 NSWLR 228 at [65].  Given that the new paragraph (d)(ii) employs the same language as (b) and (c), the Legislature should be taken to have intended the judicially established meaning of “made in circumstances” to apply.
	
	
	Fourthly, two circumstances which enhance reliability are contemporaneity (or near contemporaneity) and against interest.  That is plain from a comparison of the lesser tests of reliability imposed by paragraphs (b) and (d) in contrast with (c).  Although where (b) or (d) applies it remains necessary to assess the circumstances in which the representation is made to determine reliability, in each of those cases, a lesser level of likely reliability is required in order for the representation to be prima facie admissible.  That is to say, paragraphs (b) and (d) incorporate very clear examples of circumstances which are taken by the Legislature to increase the likely reliability of a representation.  But those two paragraphs do not exhaust the circumstances to which regard may be had; there is a wide range of other matters which bear upon the “circumstances” to which attention is required by s 65(2)(b), (c) and (d).
	
	
	Fifthly, it is to be assumed that there will be cases where s 65(2) is satisfied, but even so the evidence is excluded in accordance with ss 135 and 137.  This is a consequence of reading the Act as a whole, and accords with paragraph 8.48 ALRC Report 102.  Further, there will be cases where the evidence is not excluded under either s 65(2) or s 135 or s 137, on the basis that the prejudice associated with untested hearsay evidence is adequately addressed by a direction to the jury under s 165 (that is the premise of s165(1)(a)).
	
	
	Finally, how does an appellate court review a trial judge’s conclusion when giving a ruling on the admissibility of hearsay evidence that the circumstances make it “likely” that the representation is reliable?  In a (loose) sense, what is involved is the exercise of a “discretion”.  However, for the reasons explained in Dwyer v Calco Timbers Pty Ltd [2008] HCA 13; 234 CLR 124 at [37]-[40], it is not helpful so to describe the statutory task.  The question is binary: either the circumstances make it likely that the representation is reliable, or they do not:  Foley v Ellis [2008] NSWCA 288 at [3]; Finch v Telstra Super Pty Ltd [2010] HCA 36; 242 CLR 254 at [29]; DSG Holdings Australia Pty Ltd v Helenic Pty Ltd [2014] NSWCA 96; 86 NSWLR 293 at [84]-[85].  In short, appellate review is to be approached not in accordance with the principles in House v The King [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499, but Warren v Coombes [1979] HCA 9; 142 CLR 531.  That accords with what was said by Spigelman CJ, with the agreement of Mason P, Beazley, Giles and Ipp JJA, in Port Stephens Council v Sansom [2007] NSWCA 299 at [51].
	


(d) Resolution of ground 1


	
	Applying those principles, I would reject Mr Sio’s submissions on ground 1, for these reasons.
	
	
	First, so far as appears from the transcript, her Honour’s description of the evidence does not disclose error.  The conclusion that Mr Filihia did not appreciate, until well into the interview, that Mr Gaudry had died was amply open to her Honour.  So too was the conclusion that Mr Filihia’s answers appeared unrehearsed and sincere and forthcoming.  The interview was made within 24 hours of the events in question.  All those matters were circumstances that pointed towards likely reliability, over and above the fact that they tended to incriminate Mr Filihia.  Mr Sio did not submit to the contrary in writing or orally.
	
	
	Secondly, the fact that Mr Filihia was trying to conceal the presence of Ms Coffison does not, of itself, bear materially on the question posed by statute.  Nor do Mr Filihia’s repeated references to “Jacob” when referring to Mr Sio.  The question posed by statute is not whether the actual statements made are themselves accurate or likely reliable, but whether the circumstances in which they were made are such that they are likely to be reliable.  In order to address the statutory question, the Court examines the circumstances in which a statement is made, not the particular statement itself.  That is to say, it is no part of the analysis required by s 65(2)(d) to point to the fact that Mr Filihia’s answers were demonstrably unreliable insofar as they denied the presence of Ms Coffison or referred to “Jacob”.  (That is a consideration that could inform a discretion under ss 135 or 137, and a warning to the jury.)
	
	
	For the same reasons, and contrary to Mr Sio’s submissions, it is not relevant to draw a distinction between the reliability of some representations made by Mr Filihia (those against interest) as compared to others (those relevant to Mr Sio), a distinction which counsel candidly acknowledged had not been advanced at first instance (transcript, 5 March 2015, page 2 line 5).  The approach for which Mr Sio contended sits ill with Suteski at [93], and with the distinction between the functions of judge and jury.  To the extent that these statements were made in the same circumstances, they must be considered together for the purposes of s 65(d)(ii).
	
	
	Thirdly, it is possible that Mr Filihia was motivated by animosity to Mr Sio.  That possibility does not stand in the way of a conclusion that the circumstances made it likely that the evidence is reliable.  Moreover, her Honour was plainly alive to the possibility that the evidence might be unreliable.  As much is apparent from the warnings of potential unreliability her Honour gave to the jury immediately before the recording was played in their presence.  Her Honour said that Mr Filihia was criminally involved, had pleaded guilty to murder, “may have his own axe to grind”, and was not subject to cross-examination.  Mr Sio took no issue with the content of that direction.
	
	
	For those reasons, there is no sound basis to impugn the finding that the evidence was made in circumstances that made it likely that the statements were reliable.  For completeness, it should be added that although a copy of the recording was made available to this Court, counsel for Mr Sio, candidly and entirely properly, made it clear that it was “probably not necessary” for this Court to review it, in order to determine this ground, although it was a matter for the Court (transcript, 5 March 2015, page 12 line 4).  It will be seen that Mr Sio’s submissions, properly, respected the deference that must be given to the evaluative assessment of the primary judge who saw and heard the recording.  They did not call into question her Honour’s conclusions as to the appearance of lack of rehearsal or absence of regard to self-incrimination.  In accordance with that submission and a communication to the parties after judgment was reserved, I have not viewed any part of the recording.
	
	
	I would grant leave to appeal, but dismiss this ground.
	


Ground 2 – the verdict was unreasonable and not supported by the evidence


	
	Mr Sio’s second ground of appeal was premised upon the submission that the jury was wrong to find Mr Sio guilty of armed robbery; as it was put:
	


 

There was significant evidence that the Appellant was involved in a robbery.  However the only evidence that the robbery plan involved the use of a weapon came from Filihia, and in the context of the instant case his untested account is insufficient to sustain a conviction.

In those circumstances, it was not open to the Jury to accept beyond reasonable doubt that the Appellant was a party to a joint criminal enterprise involving an armed robbery, rather than a robbery simpliciter.  (Emphasis in original.)

 


	
	In order to find Mr Sio guilty of armed robbery by way of a joint criminal enterprise, the jury needed to be convinced beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Filihia committed the armed robbery (a fact admitted by Mr Sio at trial) as part of an “understanding or arrangement amounting to an agreement” with Mr Sio:  Osland v The Queen [1998] HCA 75; 197 CLR 316 at [73]; Huynh v The Queen [2013] HCA 6; 87 ALJR 434 at [37].  The understanding or arrangement need not be express and may be inferred from all the circumstances.  For example, an understanding to commit an armed robbery could readily be inferred from Mr Sio providing Mr Filihia with the knife used in the robbery.
	
	
	This proposed ground of appeal invokes s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW).  The question on appeal is whether “upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty”:  M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; 181 CLR 487 at [7]; SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; 243 CLR 400 at [11]; Raumakita v R [2011] NSWCCA 126; 210 A Crim R 326 at [31]-[34].  This being a question of fact, it is necessary for the Court to decide by making its own independent assessment of the whole of the evidence:  M v The Queen at [63]; SKA v The Queen at [14] and [20], while having regard to the fact that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, and which has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses:  M v the Queen at [7]; SKA v The Queen at [13].
	
	
	Accordingly, I set out the salient parts of the evidence presented at trial that are relevant to the question of whether it was open to the jury to be satisfied of Mr Sio’s guilt beyond reasonable doubt.  Leaving aside Mr Filihia’s contested evidence for present purposes, the evidence of three lay witnesses in relation to Mr Sio’s involvement in a plan to use a knife in robbing the Clyde brothel may be summarised as follows.
	
	
	First, Ms Gaudiosi, a friend of Mr Sio who previously worked at the Clyde brothel, gave the following evidence:
	


 

Q: Ms Gaudiosi, when you had a conversation with Daniel Sio about him doing a robbery at the brothel, was there ever any talk about the use of weapons?

A: Never.

Q: He didn’t talk to you about any weapons at all?

A: I told him that there would never be a use for one, like he wouldn’t need one.

Q: You told him that he wouldn’t need one?

A: Yeah.

 


	
	Secondly, Mr Robert O’Hare, a friend of Ms Coffison’s who was staying with her at the time of the robbery, and the owner of the knife used to stab Mr Gaudry, gave evidence that it went missing around a week prior to the offence.  Mr O’Hare’s evidence was that while staying with Ms Coffison he placed the knife on the television cabinet in the loungeroom in full view of visitors, apparently because he felt uneasy about certain people dropping in to Ms Coffison’s home.  According to Mr O’Hare, sometime after he left the knife on the cabinet, the knife disappeared. His evidence was:
	


 

Q: In paragraph 16 [of your statement to police] you say this:

During the early hours of Sunday 21 October 2012 I woke up on Sam’s lounge and saw what looked like my black balaclava lying on the floor beside the lounge.  I found it strange but went back to sleep straight after and forgot about it.  I can’t recall who was at the unit the night before apart from Sam and I.

You’ve read that?

A: Yes.

Q: Is that the truth what you told the police or were you upset and it’s not right?

A: It’s the truth.

Q: Paragraph 17: “When I woke up later that morning---” How far later?

A: I don’t recall.

Q:

--- I saw that the balaclava wasn’t lying where I saw it during the night.  Because I had a few things lying on the floor I thought nothing of it and believed it would turn up at some point.  I then looked up on top of the TV unit and saw that my bowie knife and sheath was also missing.

Is that right or not?

A: Yes.

 


	
	Mr O’Hare gave evidence that when he asked Ms Coffison about his missing knife, she said: “You took the knife with you in your backpack when you went to Caringbah last night”.  Mr O’Hare stated that he later asked Mr Sio whether he had seen the missing knife, to which Mr Sio responded: “Yeah, you put it in your bag last night and took it with you”.  Mr O’Hare gave evidence that “I knew that they were both lying … I haven’t seen any knife, its sheath, the balaclava or the DVD players [which also went missing the same night] since.”
	
	
	Finally, Ms Coffison gave evidence that she had previously seen the knife on the television cabinet, and confirmed that Mr O’Hare had confronted her when the knife went missing.  She gave evidence that she did not see the knife at all from the time it went missing until 30 October 2012, four days after the robbery, when she found the knife in a plastic bag in her wardrobe.  Ms Coffison specifically gave evidence that she did not see the knife at any time during the journey to or from the brothel.
	
	
	It will be clear that there were weaknesses in the Crown case insofar as it extended to Mr Sio being complicit in an armed robbery, as opposed to a robbery simpliciter.  First, while Ms Gaudiosi gave evidence that she had discussed the use of a weapon with Mr Sio, she said that she had told him that it would not be necessary to use a weapon to rob the brothel.  Secondly, putting to one side Mr Filihia’s evidence, there is no direct evidence at all on how the knife came to be used in the robbery after it disappeared from the television cabinet on or around 21 October 2012, and how it came to be in the plastic bag in Ms Coffison’s wardrobe.  Any conclusion drawn based on the evidence (leaving aside Mr Filihia’s contested evidence) is inferential. 
	
	
	There are also the unobjected to statements made by Mr Filihia which, as was pointed out unequivocally by the Crown, were outside the scope of the limited appeal (this was no administrative error; Mr Sio’s submissions (paragraph 68) made the point express:
	


 

On the appeal, no issue is taken with the admission of the ERISP conducted on 26 October 2012 (Ex J) and no issue is taken with the admission into evidence of the identification statement of Filihia that became Exhibit L at trial.)

 


	
	As noted above, exhibit J was the recording of an interview conducted on the afternoon of 25 October 2012 when Mr Filihia identified Mr Sio as the driver out of 16 photographs (“That’s the bloke Danny ... That’s was my driver”).  Exhibit L was a statement to the same effect.  However, neither the interview nor the statement contained evidence bearing on whether Mr Sio had supplied, or was aware of, the knife used to kill Mr Gaudry.
	
	
	Nevertheless, a number of factors support an inference being drawn that Mr Sio was complicit in the use of the knife in the robbery, even without reference to Mr Filihia’s contested ERISP evidence and statement.  How did the knife come to be in Mr Filihia’s hand as he entered the brothel?  While there is no direct evidence that Mr Sio took Mr O’Hare’s knife from Ms Coffison’s townhouse, relevant evidence included:
	



	
	Ms Coffison’s evidence that Mr Sio was the only visitor to her townhouse in the time that Mr O’Hare was staying.  (It may be noted that Mr O’Hare contested this statement, giving evidence that he met three people who attended Ms Coffison’s home in the time he stayed.)
	
	
	Both Mr O’Hare and Ms Coffison gave evidence that Mr Filihia never attended Ms Coffison’s townhouse.
	
	
	Forensic evidence taken from Ms Coffison’s townhouse gave no suggestion that the townhouse had recently been broken into, or the locks forced.
	
	
	The knife was ultimately present at a robbery which both Mr Sio and Ms Coffison attended, telling against the possibility of a third party having taken the knife from the townhouse.
	
	
	Further, if Ms Coffison took the knife without Mr Sio’s involvement, it is difficult to understand how the knife came to be present at the robbery, given that Ms Coffison did not go home between finishing work and attending the robbery, and had no obvious opportunity to collect the knife.
	


 


	
	Despite the absence of direct evidence on the topic, the evidence referred to above is capable of supporting the inference that it was Mr Sio who took the knife from Ms Coffison’s loungeroom, or at the very least, he was complicit in taking the knife.  This is so, despite the fact that Ms Coffison’s evidence disclaiming any knowledge of the whereabouts of, or involvement in transporting, the knife could reasonably be regarded as self-serving.  This inference may be sufficient to implicate Mr Sio in Mr Filihia’s use of the knife in the robbery, even without reference to Mr Filihia’s evidence, given that if Mr Sio had the knife prior to the robbery it was open to the jury to reason that he gave it to Mr Filihia to use, or at least was complicit in Mr Filihia using it, in the hold up at the brothel.  The possibility that Mr Filihia simply found the knife in Mr Sio’s car without Mr Sio’s knowledge and decided of his own accord to use it in the robbery seems close to fanciful in the circumstances.
	
	
	However, it is not necessary to express a view on whether it would have been open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty of armed robbery without the benefit of Mr Filihia’s contested evidence, because, for the reasons given in relation to ground 1 above, the contested ERISP and statement were properly admitted into evidence and were able to be taken into account by the jury.  The fact that the evidence was untested by cross-examination is not to the point; that is the consequence of the exception created by s 65, as was observed of the same submission in respect of s 93B of the Evidence Act 1977 (Qld) in R v Uittenbosch [2013] QCA 96 at [23].
	
	
	The relevant parts of Mr Filihia’s contested evidence concerning the knife are as follows:
	


ERISP: 24 October 2012 (at page 18):

Q236: Ok. And I won’t go into too much detail about that here, we’ll come back to that, but where did you get the knife from?

A: Jacob [Mr Sio] already had it in his car.

Q237: Ok. And where did it go?

A: Like last that I know of it was still in the car.

…

(at page 34)

Q469: Where did that [the knife] come from?

A: So it was just like ---

Q470: Where did that come from?

A: Um, it had come from him.

Q471: He gave it to you?

A: Yeah.

…

(at page 44)

Q596: O.K. All right. And where’s this knife now?

A: I don’t know, probably it’s with him.

Q597: The last time you, where the knife when you last saw it?

A: It was in his car.

Q598: In the car, in the and you, I think you said the front passenger seat.

A: Passenger seat yeah.

…

Q603: So you’ve thrown it in the front.

A: Yeah I just put it down there and said, “Here’s your knife”.

 

Mr Filihia’s Statement: 25 October 2012 (at page 2):

6. As I said in the electronic interview, it was Danny who put me up to robbing the brothel. He gave me the knife and drove me there.

 


	
	Mr Filihia’s evidence that Mr Sio gave him the knife prior to the robbery, and that Mr Filihia gave the knife back to Mr Sio, explains how the knife came to be used in the robbery, and how it ultimately came to be in the plastic bag Ms Coffison found in her wardrobe.  This evidence is corroborated by that of Ms Coffison and Mr O’Hare; it was plainly open to the jury to rely upon it to conclude that Mr Sio was aware of Mr Filihia’s use of the knife in the robbery.
	
	
	Acknowledging that certain aspects of the evidence favour Mr Sio, I consider that it was undoubtedly open to the jury to be satisfied of Mr Sio’s guilt in participating in a joint criminal enterprise (namely armed robbery) beyond reasonable doubt.  I cannot conclude that they must, as distinct from might, have entertained a reasonable doubt about Mr Sio’s agreement or understanding with Mr Filihia to commit an armed robbery, and thus Mr Sio’s guilt in respect of the charge of armed robbery by way of joint criminal enterprise.  Accordingly, although once again there should be a grant of leave, the second ground of appeal should be dismissed.
	
	
	I propose the following orders:
	


 


	
	leave to appeal granted;
	
	
	appeal against conviction dismissed.
	


 


	
	JOHNSON J:  I agree with the orders proposed by Leeming JA for the reasons given by his Honour.
	
	
	SCHMIDT J:  I agree with Leeming JA.

		31 March 2015",2015-03-30 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2703652,Application by MLP pursuant to s 78 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 [2015] NSWSC 349,"DECISION


	
	R A HULME J: MLP was sentenced by his Honour Judge Garling in the District Court on 6 October 2005 to imprisonment for 16 years with a non-parole period of 12 years with effect from 12 May 2005. This was for an offence of sexual intercourse with a person under the age of 10 years (namely 9 years) for which the applicable maximum penalty was imprisonment for 25 years and for which there was a standard non-parole period of 15 years.
	
	
	On 6 September 2006 the Court of Criminal Appeal ""confirmed"" the 16 year sentence but ""varied"" the non-parole period to one of 11 years: MLP v R [2006] NSWCCA 271; 164 A Crim R 93.
	
	
	MLP made an application pursuant to Pt 7 Div 3 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW) which resulted in the matter of sentence being referred to the Court of Criminal Appeal to be dealt with as an appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW): Application by MLP pursuant to s. 78 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 [2014] NSWSC 390. The basis of the referral was that the assessment of sentence by the Court in 2006 was based upon the principles set out in R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; 60 NSWLR 168 since held to be erroneous in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120.
	
	
	The Crown conceded the error when the matter was back before the Court last year: MLP v R [2014] NSWCCA 183 (MLP v R (2014)). Bellew J, with whom Macfarlan JA and Adamson J agreed, said (at [8]) that ""the sole issue to be determined … is whether some other sentence is warranted in law: Criminal Appeal Act 1912 s 6(3)"". After referring to various aspects of the case his Honour arrived at the conclusion that some other sentence was not warranted. The appeal was dismissed.
	
	
	MLP has now made another application pursuant to Pt 7 Div 3. The basis of the application is that Bellew J ""misdirected himself as to the operation of s 6(3); without exercising the sentencing discretion afresh, he concluded that while there was 'no doubt that the sentence imposed upon the appellant was stern … I am not persuaded that some other sentence is warranted in law'"" (Application submissions at [6]).
	
	
	Submissions were made by the applicant and by the Attorney General. The latter succinctly characterised the application as posing a question whether there was a doubt or question as to a mitigating feature in the case, namely the proper application of sentencing principles in the applicant's second appeal.
	


Section 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act


	
	Subsequent to MLP v R (2014), the High Court of Australia delivered judgment in Kentwell v The Queen [2014] HCA 37; 313 ALR 451. That case was concerned (in part) with the correct application of s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act:
	


""On an appeal under section 5 (1) against a sentence, the court, if it is of opinion that some other sentence, whether more or less severe is warranted in law and should have been passed, shall quash the sentence and pass such other sentence in substitution therefor, and in any other case shall dismiss the appeal.""


	
	The correct approach to s 6(3) was described in the joint judgment (French CJ, Hayne, Bell and Keane JJ) at [42]-[43] (with citations omitted) as follows:
	


""Spigelman CJ's analysis in Baxter should be accepted. When a judge acts upon wrong principle, allows extraneous or irrelevant matters to guide or affect the determination, mistakes the facts or does not take into account some material consideration, the Court of Criminal Appeal does not assess whether and to what degree the error influenced the outcome. The discretion in such a case has miscarried and it is the duty of the Court of Criminal Appeal to exercise the discretion afresh taking into account the purposes of sentencing and the factors that the Sentencing Act [the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW)], and any other Act or rule of law, require or permit. As sentencing is a discretionary judgment that does not yield a single correct result, it follows that a range of sentences in a given case may be said to be ""warranted in law"". A sentence that happens to be within the range but that has been imposed as the result of a legally flawed determination is not ""warranted in law"" unless, in the exercise of its independent discretion, the Court of Criminal Appeal determines that it is the appropriate sentence for the offender and the offence. This is not to say that all errors in the sentencing of offenders vitiate the exercise of the sentencer's discretion. By way of example, s 44(1) of the Sentencing Act requires the court when sentencing an offender to imprisonment to first set the non-parole period and then set the balance of the term. Prior to 1 February 2003, a court was required to first set the term of the sentence and then specify the non-parole period. A court which sentences an offender to imprisonment after 1 February 2003 by first setting the term of the sentence commits legal error. Without more, the error does not affect the exercise of the sentencer's discretion.

After having identified specific error of the kind described in House, the Court of Criminal Appeal may conclude, taking into account all relevant matters, including evidence of events that have occurred since the sentence hearing, that a lesser sentence is the appropriate sentence for the offender and the offence. This is a conclusion that that lesser sentence is warranted in law. The result of the Court of Criminal Appeal's independent exercise of discretion may be the conclusion that the same sentence or a greater sentence is the appropriate sentence. In neither case is the Court required to re-sentence. Nor is the Court required to re-sentence in a case in which it concludes that a lesser sentence is appropriate for one or more offences, but that a greater sentence is appropriate for another or other offences, with the result that the aggregate sentence that it considers warranted in law exceeds the aggregate sentence that is the subject of appeal. The occasions calling for the Court of Criminal Appeal to grant leave, allow an offender's appeal and substitute a more severe sentence are likely to be rare. Were the Court to grant leave in such a case, convention would require that it inform the appellant of its intended course so that he or she might abandon the appeal.""


	
	Two things emerge from the above that are pertinent to the present application. The first (and this is emphasised in the applicant's submissions) is that in considering the issue in s 6(3) the Court must exercise the sentencing discretion afresh. It is a matter of moving directly from the identification of error to an independent determination of what sentence was warranted in all the circumstances (including matters that have arisen since the original sentencing exercise). The second is that it is a matter of comparison of what that determination yields with what the original sentence was.
	
	
	There is nothing that indicates that this involves a sequential or two-step process; the two issues may be considered simultaneously. This is because there is but one question posed by s 6(3): whether the Court is ""of opinion that some other sentence, whether more or less severe is warranted in law and should have been passed"".
	


Submissions and consideration


	
	It was submitted by senior counsel for the applicant that Bellew J had misdirected himself by inserting ""an intermediate step requiring that he be 'persuaded' that some other sentence was warranted in law or that the sentence was outside an established range, prior to exercising the sentencing discretion afresh"" (Application submissions at [9]). This was said to arise from two aspects of his Honour's judgment:
	


1.   The language adopted by his Honour: that the sentence was not outside the ""established range"" and that he was ""not persuaded"" that another sentence was warranted.

2.   The incomplete manner in which his Honour considered the matters that would otherwise have been relevant to a genuine re-exercise of the sentencing discretion.


	
	Focus was placed by the applicant upon the following paragraphs:
	


""[46] Even if such conclusions are supported by the statistical material, they do not lead to the further conclusion that some other sentence is warranted in the present case. The sentence imposed upon the appellant might well be the highest imposed for a single instance of offending contrary to s. 66A. That does not demonstrate that the sentence is unduly harsh. As a matter of common sense, there will always be one sentence which constitutes the longest sentence imposed for particular offending: Jolly v R [2013] NSWCCA 76 at [75]. In my view, the statistical material put before the Court in the present case does not support a conclusion that some other sentence is warranted.

[47] I have considered the cases to which the Court was referred in which sentences were imposed for similar offending and which were said to demonstrate the harshness of the sentence imposed upon the appellant. I am not persuaded that they support the conclusion that some other sentence is warranted, nor am I persuaded that they establish that the sentence imposed upon the appellant is at odds with some established sentencing range.

…

[52] There is no doubt that the sentence imposed upon the appellant was stern. However, having considered the submissions advanced on behalf of the appellant, I am not persuaded that some other sentence is warranted. In coming to that view, I have had regard to the two legislative guideposts to which I previously referred.""

(The underlining and italics are mine and direct attention to words that were the focus of the applicant's submissions)


	
	There is another important matter to be borne in mind aside from the two matters that emerge from Kentwell v The Queen that I have referred to above. The Court does not consider those two matters in a vacuum. It considers them in the context of submissions made by the parties. An appellant's submissions focus upon an attempt to persuade the Court that a lesser sentence than that originally passed is warranted whilst the Crown's submissions (not necessarily but usually) focus upon an attempt to persuade the Court that a lesser sentence than that originally passed is not warranted. It is understandable then that the Court will express itself in terms of whether it is persuaded by one or the other. It naturally follows from this that having made its own independent assessment of what sentence should have been passed, the Court would provide reasons for why it is not persuaded by the submissions of the unsuccessful party to a different conclusion either generally or in relation to submissions on discrete topics (here, for example, in relation to statistics and comparisons with other cases).
	
	
	The submissions for the applicant (at [10]) identify that Bellew J referred in his reasons for judgment to a number of matters that had been the subject of his submissions to the Court:
	


The offending was isolated in nature.

The applicant had spent the entirety of his sentence in protective custody.

He remained at risk of assault.

He had been generally well-behaved while in custody.

He had undertaken such rehabilitative programs as had been offered to him.

He had been employed.

He had a number of serious health issues.

His mother had died following complications during routine surgery in 2010 leaving his elderly father, who was in poor health, adversely affected and unable to visit the applicant regularly. And his siblings, all of whom are blind, could not adequately care for his father nor visit the applicant regularly.

Sentencing statistics and other cases involving similar offending.


	
	The applicant's submissions also referred (at [12]) to the following matters that Bellew J had considered:
	


The legislative guideposts of the maximum penalty and the standard non-parole period prescribed for the offence.

That the offending was objectively serious and there was an abuse of a position of trust.

(The reference to these matters in the judgment was explained in summary fashion (at [28]): ""the appellant forced his penis into the vagina of his daughter who was then only 9 years of age. The offending occurred in the immediate presence of the appellant's other children"".)

That concentrating on the short duration of the offending minimised or ignored the significance of long term effect of such offending on a young victim.

(Bellew J referred to R v Gavel [2014] NSWCCA 56 at [110]-[112]. And he said (at [30]) that whatever the precise duration of the offending, the ""more important factor is that … the offending occurred over a sufficient period of time, and with sufficient force, to tear the victim's hymen"".)

That the applicant apparently continued to deny the offending.

(His Honour continued (at [33]) by saying that the potentially mitigating feature of remorse is not something that can be taken into account in the applicant's favour.)

That ill-health does not necessarily operate in mitigation where the offending is serious and some of it pre-dated the offending.

(And (at [38]) his Honour was satisfied that the applicant was receiving appropriate treatment whilst in custody.)

That while the various matters concerning the applicant's family members rendered it more difficult for him to have contact with them, this was not an uncommon occurrence for prison inmates.

(His Honour also accepted (at [39]) that the circumstances surrounding the applicant's mother's death was a source of considerable anxiety for him.)


	
	The applicant's submissions took no issue with the description by Bellew J (at [18]) of the applicant's submission in MLP v R (2014) that ""sentencing statistics, along with a number of sentences imposed in other [similar] cases … demonstrated that the sentence imposed upon the [applicant] was unduly harsh and unwarranted"".
	
	
	The submissions for the Attorney General, while disagreeing with every other aspect of the applicant's submissions, conceded that it would be open to conclude the matter should be referred to the Court of Criminal Appeal because the use of terms like ""harsh"" may suggest that the assessment was confined to whether the sentence was within a ""permissible range"". If that were the case, there would be error because the task with which the Court was engaged under s 6(3) requires more than that as the joint reasons in Kentwell v The Queen explain.
	
	
	I respectfully disagree that the use of these terms was erroneous. The Attorney General argued that every other aspect of the judgment is indicative of an independent discretion being exercised. The use of ""harsh"" in the context of addressing submissions by the applicant that statistics and comparable cases demonstrated that the sentence was ""unduly harsh and unwarranted"" is perfectly explicable and not inconsistent with his Honour engaging in the correct approach. Similarly the use of the term “stern” is not indicative of error. A 16 year sentence is self-evidently amenable to such a description. But his Honour was clearly of the view that such an outcome was warranted.
	
	
	It was submitted by the applicant that his Honour failed to take into account in a ""genuine re-sentencing exercise"" the matters I referred to in the applicant's submissions (at [10]) which I have listed above (at [14]). The fact that his Honour troubled himself to refer to them does not support a proposition that he did not take them into account.
	
	
	The fact that Bellew J engaged in an independent exercise of sentencing discretion is further indicated by the fact that he did not simply adopt findings made by the primary judge; without necessarily descending into every detail he did refer to all significant objective and subjective circumstances of the case; and he did not ignore evidence of matters that had arisen since sentence.
	
	
	I cannot identify any error in the approach taken by Bellew J, with the concurrence of the two other members of the Court, to the assessment of the issue posed by s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act.
	
	
	Isolating a few words here or there (""not persuaded"" for example) is not a fair approach to the assessment of the judgment as a whole and fails to appreciate the complete task with which his Honour was engaged. Statements such as his Honour not being persuaded that the sentence was ""at odds with some established sentencing range"" have to be seen in the context of submissions by the applicant that the sentence was ""at odds"".
	
	
	There is no suggestion that his Honour failed to take into account any sentencing principle; any evidentiary matter (I reject the applicant's submissions (at [18]-[20]) that some particular matters were not expressly referred to; his Honour sufficiently referred to the gist of all that had been put on the applicant's behalf); or any submission advanced on the applicant's behalf. To the contrary, it appears that his Honour thoroughly canvassed all of the evidence and submissions.
	


Conclusion


	
	The applicant submitted that the doubt or question that warranted the referral pursuant to Div 3 of Pt 7 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act last year remains because of the erroneous approach taken to the re-sentencing exercise by the Court in MLP v R (2014). It was submitted (at [1]) that ""despite two appeals, the applicant has still not been sentenced according to law, as is his entitlement: Kentwell at [44]"". With respect to the learned authors of that submission, I reject it.
	
	
	To reiterate, what was required was for the Court to make an independent assessment of the appropriate sentence and compare it with that which had been imposed in order to determine whether there should be a lesser sentence. Necessarily, that had to be done in the context of the submissions that had been made in an endeavour to persuade the Court one way or the other. This was done.
	
	
	I feel no unease or sense of disquiet that this task was not undertaken in MLP v R (2014). And, not that it is necessary to fulfil my present function, I have nevertheless considered for myself the question whether a lesser sentence was warranted and should have been passed. I have no unease or sense of disquiet about the answer to that question being answered by the Court of Criminal Appeal in the negative.

	The application is refused.

		31 March 2015",2015-03-30 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2703655,AH v R [2015] NSWCCA 51,"Judgment


	
	BEAZLEY P: I have had the advantage of reading in draft the reasons of Hidden J. I agree with his Honour’s reasons and the orders he proposes.
	
	
	HIDDEN J: The applicant pleaded guilty in the District Court to the following charges:
	



	
	Count 1: Aggravated sexual intercourse with a child under 10 and under authority, an offence under s 66A(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 which carries a maximum sentence of imprisonment for life and a standard non-parole period of 15 years.
	
	
	Count 2: Aggravated act of indecency towards a child under 10, an offence under s 61O(2) of the Act which carries a maximum sentence of imprisonment for seven years.
	
	
	Count 3: Aggravated indecent assault on a child under 16, an offence under s 61M(2) of the Act which carries a maximum sentence of 10 years imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of 8 years.
	
	
	Count 4: Aggravated act of indecency on a child under 16 and under authority, an offence under s 61O(1) of the Act which carries a maximum sentence of 5 years imprisonment.
	


The applicant asked the sentencing judge to take into account on a Form 1 two further offences of aggravated indecent assault (s 61M(2)).


	
	On 12 December 2013, the sentencing judge imposed an aggregate sentence of imprisonment for 10 years, with a non-parole period of 6 ½ years, dating from 11 December 2013. The indicative sentences were as follows:
	



	
	Count 1 – Taking into account the offences on the Form 1 - 8 years with a non-parole period of 6 years;
	
	
	Count 2 –2 years;
	
	
	Count 3 - 3 years with a non-parole period of 2 years and 3 months;
	
	
	Count 4 – 18 months.
	


Facts


	
	The victim was the child of the applicant’s de facto partner. She was born on 23 August 2002. The applicant had been in a relationship with her mother from 2009. The offending took place over a period of 14 to 15 months, from September 2011 to December 2012, at the applicant’s home, where he lived with his partner and the victim. Over that period she was aged between 9 and 10 years, and he between 39 and 40.
	


Count 1


	
	When the victim was 9 years old, the applicant exposed his penis to her and told her to kiss it. She did as she was told. He then told her to close her eyes and open her mouth, which she did. He placed his penis into her mouth for a short period before she pulled herself away. The victim’s mother was at home at the time, but in another room.
	
	
	The other offences occurred in the applicant’s bedroom when he directed the victim to follow him there.
	


Count 2


	
	When the victim was 9 years old, the applicant exposed his penis and began to masturbate in front of her. He asked her to get him a face washer. He then asked her to touch his penis, but she refused and moved away. He ejaculated into the face washer and she left the room.
	


Count 3


	
	This offence occurred in April 2012, when the victim was aged 9, on an occasion when her mother was out. She and the applicant went to his bedroom and got onto his bed. He pulled up her top to expose her breasts and began to kiss her on the stomach and breasts. After a period of time he allowed her to leave the room.
	


Count 4


	
	In December 2012, when she was aged 10, the applicant directed the victim to lie on his bed. He lay beside her and exposed his penis, telling her to kiss it. Instead, she touched his penis for a short period before getting off the bed and leaving the room.
	


Form 1 offences


	
	These offences occurred when the victim was 10 years old, on an occasion when she was at home alone with the applicant. Again, she followed him to his bedroom at his direction. At the doorway he stopped and tongue kissed her for several seconds before she pulled away. She followed him into the room and climbed onto the bed. He pulled her dress up over her face and her shorts down. She said, “No,” and left the room.
	
	
	The offending ceased when the victim summoned the courage to tell her mother what had happened. When her mother confronted the applicant, he immediately admitted what he had done.
	
	
	The sentencing judge saw the offence the subject of count 1 as objectively the most serious. Her Honour noted, however, that the act of fellatio was brief, the applicant did not ejaculate, and it was not accompanied by force or threats. The offences of aggravated indecent assault on the Form 1 she saw as less serious than the offences on the indictment but, of course, they had to be reflected in the sentence on count 1. In relation to counts 2 and 3 her Honour noted as an aggravating factor that the victim was under the applicant’s authority: s 21A(2)(k) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. She did not take that factor into account in respect of counts 1 and 4, as it was an element of the offence charged. However, she observed that all the offences were a gross breach of trust by the applicant.
	
	
	As to count 2, her Honour noted that the victim felt able to refuse the applicant’s request that she touch his penis. Counts 3 and 4 she described as relatively brief episodes, while noting that they were committed when the victim was 10 years old, considerably short of the upper limit of 16 years for those offences.
	
	
	Generally, her Honour described the offences as “opportunistic rather than premeditated.”
	


Subjective case


	
	The applicant is now 42 years old. He has no prior convictions. His subjective case was entirely favourable, and was summarised briefly, but adequately, in her Honour’s remarks on sentence.
	
	
	He had previously been married and there is a child of that relationship. There is a 1 year old son from his relationship with the victim’s mother, from whom he is estranged. His own family remains supportive of him. He was educated to Higher School Certificate standard, has served in the reserve defence forces, and has a creditable employment history.
	
	
	Her Honour found him to be genuinely remorseful, and to have very good prospects of rehabilitation. She noted the opinion of a psychiatrist, Dr Andrew Ellis, who provided a report, that he was suffering a major depressive episode at the time of sentence. In that report Dr Ellis assessed him at low risk of reoffending, and he was willing to engage in appropriate treatment.
	
	
	Her Honour saw his early pleas of guilty as consistent with his remorse and acceptance of responsibility for his offences, and recognised the utilitarian value of those pleas by a 25% reduction of sentence. Her Honour also found special circumstances, noting that he would benefit from a longer period of supervision on parole after his release from an inevitably lengthy custodial term.
	


The application


	
	Counsel for the applicant, Mr Warwick Hunt, argued four grounds of appeal. Ground 1 challenges her Honour’s assessment of the objective gravity of the offences, and ground 3 asserts that her Honour failed to give appropriate weight to the applicant’s subjective case. I see these grounds more as arguments in support of ground 4, which is that the aggregate sentence is manifestly excessive, and I shall consider those three grounds together. Before doing so, however, it is appropriate to deal with ground 2, which raises a discrete issue concerning the applicant’s good character.
	


Character


	
	The ground is that her Honour erred in finding that the applicant’s good character was of assistance to him in the commission of the offences. This requires consideration of s 21A(5A) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, which provides:
	


“(5A)   In determining the appropriate sentence for a child sexual offence, the good character or lack of previous convictions of an offender is not to be taken into account as a mitigating factor if the court is satisfied that the factor concerned was of assistance to the offender in the commission of the offence.”


	
	In the present case, applying that subsection, her Honour found that the applicant’s lack of prior convictions was not a mitigating factor on the basis that “his good character was a factor which was of assistance to him in the commission of these offences.” However, the basis of that finding is not explained.
	
	
	Mr Hunt submitted that the applicant’s good character played no part in his obtaining access to the victim. He was not exercising a role in the community which might have afforded him access to children, such as a teacher, sports coach or pastor. He also contrasted the present case with O’Brien v R [2013] NSWCCA 197, a case involving the sexual abuse of a girl by an offender who had befriended her family. Adamson J, with whom Latham J and I agreed, noted at [25] that he had been a responsible and helpful member of his community, and observed at [39] that he had “used his good character to gain access to the victim and to gain her trust.”
	
	
	The Crown prosecutor in this court argued that the finding was open to her
	


Honour, noting the applicant’s relationship with the victim’s mother, the period of time over which the offences were committed and the breach of trust which they involved. She referred to the following passage from the judgment of Fullerton J, with whom Spigelman CJ and Barr J agreed, in R v PGM [2008] NSWCCA 172, 187 A Crim R 152 at [44] (162-3):

“In this case, while his Honour was entitled to take the respondent's previous good character into account, to afford it ‘very significant weight,’ in my view, failed to recognise the pattern of repeat offending over a period of seven months in the course of an ongoing relationship between the respondent and the child — a relationship which was deliberately fostered by him for his own sexual gratification. Where these features are present a finding that the criminal conduct is out of character fails to recognise that a determined and conscious course of offending, perhaps in the expectation that the child may not see the offending conduct as wrong thereby both avoiding detection and maximising the opportunity for repeated offending, diminishes the mitigating impact of a finding of good character (see R v Kennedy [2000] NSWCCA 527 at [21] and R v ABS [2005] NSWCCA 255 where at [25] Buddin J emphasised that repeat offending in the context of sexual offences deprives on offender of a claim for leniency that might otherwise be available where the offending was spontaneous and only involves an isolated incident).”


	
	PGM was decided before s 21A(5A) came into operation, and the decision does not address the particular issue raised by the subsection. The passage from the judgment of Fullerton J remains relevant to an assessment of the significance of good character in child sexual assault cases, and is clearly apposite in the present case. However, it is not relevant to the particular issue raised by subs (5A), which is directed to the question whether an offender’s good character facilitated his commission of a child sexual offence.
	
	
	Mr Hunt’s argument on this ground should be accepted. Whatever be the ambit of subs (5A), it is not applicable to the present case. Obviously, his relationship with the victim’s mother and the trust which that engendered created an environment in which the offences could be committed. It does not appear to me, however, that his good character could be said to have assisted his commission of the offences. This ground is made out.
	


Manifest excess?


	
	Ground 2 having been established, this court’s discretion to re-sentence is enlivened. That being so, it is not strictly necessary to decide the remaining grounds. However, it is appropriate to refer to them briefly.
	
	
	Mr Hunt submitted that the aggregate sentence was manifestly excessive, as were the indicated sentences. He argued that each of the offences was in the lower range of gravity of offences of its kind, and challenged her Honour’s general observation that all of the offences were “clearly objectively very serious as they involve a child aged only 9 or 10 at the relevant time.” Her Honour referred to a victim impact statement made by the victim but said that no such statement was required “to understand the effects of such sexual abuse on young children, as they are well established.”
	
	
	In my view, however, her Honour’s description of the offences as objectively very serious was no more than a general observation about the undoubted gravity of offending of this kind, whatever the particular incidents of it might be. As I have recorded above, her Honour went on to examine the objective gravity of each offence, noting features of each of them which tended to mitigate its seriousness. As I have said, she characterised the offences generally as opportunistic, while emphasising the gross breach of trust which they certainly involved. It appears to me that her Honour made a careful, and sound, assessment of the seriousness of the offences.
	
	
	Mr Hunt argued that the aggregate sentence failed to give appropriate weight to the applicant’s favourable subjective case. There can be no doubt that her Honour had regard to that subjective case and made findings favourable to the applicant, particularly on the issues of remorse and rehabilitation. Mr Hunt noted that her Honour had referred to the depressive illness which the applicant was suffering at the time of sentence, but argued that she had failed to have regard to an observation in the report of Dr Ellis that the applicant felt that he “may have been depressed in mood” at the relevant time, although “this was not as severe or pervasive as his current presentation.” Very little can be made of that material. I cannot accept Mr Hunt’s argument that it might invoke the principles relating to the bearing of mental illness upon general deterrence enunciated in cases such as R v Engert (1995) 84 A Crim R 67.
	
	
	Finally, Mr Hunt referred to the indicated sentences for counts 2, 3 and 4, and noted that each of those offences could have been dealt with summarily. This was not a matter which had been raised before her Honour. That is a significant factor, although it is not necessarily fatal to the argument: cf Bonwick v R [2010] NSWCCA 177, per Davies J (with whom McClellan CJ at CL and James J agreed) at [44]. However, the status of those terms as indicative sentences should not be overlooked. They are not themselves appellable, although they may be a guide as to whether error is established in the aggregate sentence: JM v R [2014] NSWCCA 297, per RA Hulme J (with whom Hoeben CJ at CL and Adamson J agreed) at [40]. The indicated sentence for count 1 was 8 years with a non-parole period of 6 years, so that it appears that the effect of the other three sentences was to increase the head sentence by 2 years and the non-parole period by 6 months. It is difficult to see how the possibility of those offences being dealt with summarily could have ameliorated that outcome.
	
	
	As her Honour said, count 1 was clearly the most serious of the offences and, in sentencing for it, the matters on the Form 1 were to be taken into account. The other offences, while considerably less seriousness, called for a significant measure of further punishment. As a reflection of the whole of the applicant’s criminality, the aggregate sentence was not manifestly excessive.
	


Lesser sentence warranted?


	
	The vital question is whether this court should exercise its discretion any differently: Kentwell v The Queen [2014] HCA 37, 88 ALJR 947. While affording appropriate weight to the applicant’s subjective case, the nature of the offences, the age of the victim, the period over which they were committed and the serious breach of trust involved justifies the aggregate sentence of imprisonment for 10 years with a non-parole period of 6 ½ years which her Honour imposed. In my view, no lesser sentence was warranted. In arriving at this conclusion, I have taken into account an affidavit of the applicant read in this court in which he expresses his remorse for his offences and discloses that he is on protection, is undergoing psychological counselling for his depression, is willing to participate in any treatment program available to him in custody and upon his release, and continues to enjoy family support.
	
	
	I would grant leave to appeal but dismiss the appeal.
	
	
	FULLERTON J: I agree with Hidden J.

2703659,Rangihuna v R [2015] NSWCCA 48,"Judgment


	
	R A HULME J:   I agree with Davies J.
	
	
	DAVIES J:   On 24 July 2013 the Applicant pleaded guilty to three offences as follows:
	


Count 1:   Aggravated assault with intent to rob in company;

Count 2:   Aggravated robbery in company;

Count 3:   Aggravated robbery in company.

The maximum penalty for each of these offences is 25 years imprisonment.


	
	The Applicant asked the Sentencing Judge to take into account two further offences on a Form 1 associated with count 1. Those offences were larceny for which the maximum penalty is 5 years imprisonment and aggravated break and enter with intent to steal, the maximum penalty for which is 14 years imprisonment.
	
	
	On 27 September 2013 Acting Judge Freeman in the District Court sentenced the Applicant as follows:
	


Count 1:   Taking into account the matters on the Form 1, a non-parole period of 5 years and 3 months commencing 31 January 2012 and expiring 30 April 2017 with an additional term of 1 year 9 months expiring 30 January 2019;

Count 2:   A non-parole period of 4 years 3 months commencing 31 January 2015 and expiring 30 April 2019 with an additional term of 17 months expiring 30 September 2020;

Count 3:   A non-parole period of 2 years and 3 months commencing 31 January 2018 and expiring 30 April 2020 with a balance of term of 3 years expiring 30 April 2023.


	
	The Applicant seeks leave to appeal on one ground only:
	


The sentencing judge erred in the structuring of the sentences for the individual offences in that there was an inappropriate accumulation of the sentences imposed which led to a combined sentence that overstates the total criminality of the offences.

The facts


	
	The agreed facts adopted by the Sentencing Judge disclosed the following.
	



	
	(a)   St George Hotel, 9 December 2011
	


Count 1:   Assault with intent to rob, in company, whilst armed with a dangerous weapon

Form 1 offence - Stealing


	
	About 3:15am on Friday 9 December 2011 three offenders, including the Applicant, forced a rear glass door to the St George Hotel, at 618 Canterbury Road, Belmore causing it to shatter. The Applicant was armed with a black replica pistol. One of the others carried an axe. One of the others was carrying a bag and told hotel staff and security (Wayne Borg) that it contained a shotgun. The offenders violently confronted Wayne Borg with the weapons, throwing him to the ground. They forced him to go to the gaming and bar areas.
	
	
	The offenders were yelling at Wayne Borg to make him comply, and were also demanding cash. There was a guard dog in the vicinity. The man with the axe (not the Applicant) said, ""If the fucking dog bites me I'll smash you in the head with the fucking axe."" The Applicant said nothing at that time. Mr Borg was terrified.
	
	
	It was the intention of the offenders as part of a joint criminal enterprise, including the Applicant, to rob the hotel of the money which was the proceeds of the night's trading.
	
	
	The group were unable to access any of the proceeds of the hotel's trade as it had already been reconciled and secured in an office safe prior to the offence. This money was in the possession of the bar manager, Chien Hui Lo. As they left, the offenders stole a wallet belonging to Mr Lo, containing $100 and bank cards. The stealing of this wallet and its contents was part of a joint criminal enterprise between the offenders. (1st Form 1 offence).
	
	
	The offenders wore the hooded jumpers back-to-front. The hoods, with eye holes cut out at the ""rear"", concealed their faces and were tied behind their heads so that, effectively, they acted as balaclavas.
	
	
	Police responding to the robbery recovered a plastic magazine to the replica pistol which had been used in the offences in the rear car park of the hotel. This had been dropped either just before or just after the offences.
	
	
	Some telephone conversations involving the Applicant were intercepted. These included discussions about surveying potential locations to commit robberies, the group meeting at the Applicant's house before the offence and the use of equipment stored in co-offender Bokhari's vehicle for use in this offence. Bokhari was a friend of the Applicant.
	
	
	Physical surveillance operations sighted and photographed the Applicant associating with Bokhari and travelling in Bokhari's maroon Holden Commodore sedan several hours before this offence on 8 December 2011.
	
	
	On 20 December 2011, police searched Bokhari's maroon Holden Commodore sedan. A black replica self loading pistol was located in the vehicle's front passenger door. The replica pistol was reasonably heavy with a partly metal frame and working slide, but the magazine inserted through the pistol grip was missing. The pistol magazine located at the scene of the St George Hotel robbery was found to match and fit this pistol.
	
	
	Plastic cable ties and several sets of clothing including hooded jumpers, tracksuit pants, pairs of gloves and shoes were also located in the boot of the vehicle. DNA on swabs taken from clothing found in the car was analysed. The analysis shows that 7 of the items had the same DNA profile as the accused.
	


(b)   Earlwood Bowling and Recreational Club - 11 December 2011

Form 1 offence: Break and enter with intent to steal, in circumstances of aggravation (in company)


	
	About 12:45am on Sunday 11 December 2011 four offenders armed with a black replica pistol, a military style rifle and a crow bar forced entry to the Earlwood Bowling and Recreational Club on Woolcott Street, Earlwood by kicking in and smashing the glass panel of a side entrance to the premises. The Applicant was carrying the replica pistol.
	
	
	As they entered the main bar area they were interrupted by a guard (Denis Andrews) who activated the security alarm. This resulted in them leaving before being able to steal the proceeds of the night's trading, which was their joint intention when they broke in. One offender attempted to access the poker machines without success.
	
	
	As in the St George Hotel offences, the offenders wore the hooded jumpers as described at [11] above.
	
	
	Telephone interception evidence included discussions between members of the group involved in the commission of this offence (including the Applicant) about making observations of access points and security measures at the Earlwood Club on 25 November 2011, the Applicant attempting to contact Bokhari several hours before the offence (Bokhari had been storing weapons and clothing used by the group in the commission of armed robbery offences) and members of the group meeting at the Applicant's residence after the offence.
	


(c)   The Metro Service Station at 442 Punchbowl Road, Belmore - 24    December 2011

Count 2:   Armed robbery in company, whilst armed with a dangerous weapon


	
	About 5:30am on Saturday 24 December 2011, the Applicant and a co-offender Coleman Rongo entered the Metro Service Station at 442 Punchbowl Road, Belmore. The Applicant was armed with a black replica pistol and the co-offender was armed with a knife. An employee, Fakhrul Munna, was working alone.
	
	
	The Applicant pointed the replica pistol at Mr Munna and threatened him. The co-offender threatened Mr Munna with the knife. Mr Munna was terrified. They robbed Mr Munna of about $1500 from the cash register and forty assorted packets of cigarettes before fleeing in a Silver Nissan Pulsar SSS hatchback.
	
	
	The offenders again disguised themselves with jumpers worn backwards and hoods concealing the faces in the same manner as balaclavas and strikingly similar to the disguises worn during the commission of the earlier offences at the St George Hotel and the Earlwood Club.
	
	
	Telephone interception evidence included discussions pre-offence between the Applicant and Rongo about meeting for the purpose of ""training"" (coded language used to describe them preparing for and committing armed robberies) and discussions post-offence about a police media release that identified a vehicle to be a silver Nissan Pulsar SSS hatchback as being believed by police to have been used in connection with the offence. In these discussions it was evident that those involved, including the Applicant were concerned about being seen and/or linked to the vehicle.
	
	
	The Applicant was in possession of the Silver Nissan Pulsar SSS hatchback before and after this offence.
	


(d)   The Forest Inn, Bexley- 25 December 2011

Count 3:   Armed robbery in company, whilst armed with a dangerous weapon


	
	About 3:40am on Sunday 25 December 2011, the Applicant, Albert Blake and another male accessed the Forest Inn at 467 Forest Road, Bexley by kicking in and smashing a door. The Applicant was armed with a black replica pistol. The co-offenders were armed with a knife and a pipe or bar.
	
	
	They confronted staff and patrons with their weapons, demanding they lie on the floor, before dragging the bar manager (Rodney Austin) to the office and robbing him of $19,082.00 cash which was the evening's bar and poker machine trade proceeds. During this time Mr Austin was hit in the head by one of the offenders. The Applicant repeatedly pointed the replica pistol at the bar manager, and at other staff, who thought it was a real gun. The victims were terrified by the actions of the offenders.
	
	
	Prior to leaving, the offenders attempted to smash open the sliding glass security door at the front entrance by kicking it. The offenders then fled.
	
	
	Two of the offenders, one of whom was the Applicant, disguised themselves in the same hooded jumpers as those worn in the armed robbery at the Metro Service Station the previous morning using the improvised concealment of their faces. These offenders were also armed with the same weapons as those used in the commission of that earlier offence.
	
	
	Telephone interception evidence included discussions involving the Applicant and Blake about the offenders meeting and coordinating equipment for use in the commission of the offence.
	
	
	At 7:00pm on Tuesday 31 January 2012, the Applicant presented himself at Campsie Police Station in accordance with an existing bail order on unrelated matters. He was arrested in connection with the armed robbery matters and entered into custody.
	


Subjective matters


	
	The Applicant was born in April 1984 and was aged 27 at the time of the offending. His criminal record commenced in May 2000 when he was convicted in the Bidura Children’s Court for the offence of robbery in company. For that offence he received 100 hours of community service.
	
	
	Later the same year he was convicted of two counts of robbery armed with an offensive weapon in respect of which he received a control order for nine months. The following year he was convicted of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and another count of robbery. He was given a 9 month control order for the robbery.
	
	
	There were no further convictions until December 2008 when he received a 12 month section 9 bond for an assault occasioning actual bodily harm. His offending was, therefore, sporadic, although the offences were serious. The Sentencing Judge, whilst accepting that most of the offences were ten years prior or more held, nevertheless, that the Applicant’s record did not assist him.
	
	
	The only evidence concerning the Applicant’s background was contained in a pre-sentence report and a psychological report prepared by Chris Probetts of Proactive Psychology. The contents of both reports were simply adopted by the Applicant in his evidence in chief before the Sentencing Judge despite there being inconsistencies between them.
	
	
	The Sentencing Judge rejected the conclusions in the report of Mr Probetts largely because his Honour said it appeared to accept unconditionally and unequivocally the assertions of the Applicant on which it was based. The Sentencing Judge noted, however, that the psychological report revealed that the Applicant had no psychological disorder and did not require treatment.
	
	
	The Applicant was born in New Zealand and moved to Australia when he was seven or eight years of age. He had a good relationship with his parents during his childhood. His parents were still together and were happily married. The Applicant was the youngest of six children.
	
	
	He completed Year 10 but by that time he was under the supervision of Juvenile Justice for his early offending. He undertook and learnt certain employment skills and was subsequently employed mainly in audio-visual assembly including plasma screens, projectors and interactive white boards.
	
	
	He met his partner in about 2008 and one boy was born to that relationship.
	
	
	At some point he ascertained that his partner was working as a prostitute and that caused difficulties and separations. The Applicant told the Community Corrections Officer who prepared the pre-sentence report as well as Mr Probetts that it was the breakdown of the relationship which was responsible for his increased alcohol and illicit drug abuse that led to the present offending.
	
	
	However, he told the Community Corrections Officer that he commenced using alcohol at the age of 16 and would consume alcohol on a weekly basis drinking to intoxication each time. He said he had been smoking one gram of cannabis every second day since the age of 16 and that had increased to three grams a day in 2010. In that year he also commenced smoking heroin every third day and methamphetamine daily. He did not see any of these matters as being problematic. The Corrections Officer said that he tended to justify his behaviour by saying that he had committed the offences to finance his increased alcohol and illicit drug use.
	
	
	The Sentencing Judge formed a most unfavourable view of the Applicant. He found him to be neither remorseful nor credible.
	


Remarks on Sentence


	
	The Sentencing Judge noted that the offence on the Form 1 of aggravated enter a building with intent was a serious offence. His Honour observed that placing an offence on a Form 1 did not make the offence thereby disappear. Rather, the function of a Form 1, if appropriate, was to increase the sentence on the substantive charge because additional criminality was identified. His Honour considered that there was additional criminality at least by that offence.
	
	
	The Sentencing Judge said that the offences were very serious ones with a great deal of violence. His Honour noted that the people who suffered from the carrying out of those crimes must have been terrified, and probably for some considerable time after were affected by psychological sequelae of their experiences. His Honour said that the principle of general deterrence had a special part to play.
	
	
	His Honour then dealt with the two reports to which I have referred and went on to say this:
	


I do accept the pre-sentence report, the author of which referred to the prisoner's attitude as being not one of remorse concerning at least the victims and that report identified a clear need for the prisoner to be supervised, supported and guided in a number of areas, especially counselling for drug and alcohol abuse and gambling. To facilitate the lengthy delivery of these supervisory services and to mark the fact that this is the prisoner's first time in adult custody I have made a very small adjustment to the overall propositions (sic) of his sentence. Some adjustment to the last sentence was necessary in any event because of the accumulation of these sentences. Accumulation itself is necessary to mark the fact that these are entirely separate crimes, committed at different times, involving different victims. However the reasonably brief span of time during which they were committed, the connections in terms of equipment, clothing and so on as being part of a campaign of crime and the methods all tend towards some concurrency. By far the most important reason for concurrency however is the principle of totality in order to bring these sentences back within the range appropriate overall to the criminality displayed so some concurrency has been ordered and some accumulation.

Ground of appeal


	
	No issue was taken by the Applicant with the individual sentences imposed nor with the fact that there was a partial accumulation of the sentences. It was the structuring of the sentences which was said to have led to a combined sentence that overstated the total criminality. During oral submissions it was made clear that the error in accumulation was said to have occurred in relation to Count 3. It was submitted that the 3 year accumulation on the sentence for Count 2 led to the overstatement of the criminality.
	
	
	The Applicant accepted that questions of concurrence or accumulation are a discretionary matter for the Sentencing Judge. Reference was made to R v Hammoud [2000] NSWCCA 540; (2000) 118 A Crim R 66 at [7] and Johnson v The Queen (2004) 78 ALJR 616 at [26]. However, the Applicant submitted that the discretion must be subject to what is required in a particular case to reflect the totality of the criminality, referring to Howie J in R v Merrin [2007] NSWCCA 255; (2007) 174 A Crim R 100 at [36].
	
	
	The Applicant pointed to three matters that it was said demonstrated that the accumulation was unreasonable and unjust on a House v The King basis. First, the offences in Counts 2 and 3 were both committed within a very short period of time of each other. Secondly, despite his early offending, the Applicant had not come to the attention of the authorities for some years. Thirdly, reliance was placed on the Applicant’s subjective circumstances, particularly his problems with drugs and alcohol.
	
	
	The Applicant relied on five cases involving multiple robbery offences for the purpose of demonstrating the way the courts have exercised the discretion to accumulate. Those cases were R v Smith [2007] NSWCCA 100, R v Lesi [2010] NSWCCA 240, R v Taufahema [2010] NSWCCA 241, McCarthy v R [2011] NSWCCA 64; (2011) 206 A Crim R 131, and McIvor v R [2010] NSWCCA 7.
	
	
	Minimal assistance can be obtained from those decisions in the way the sentences have been structured. Three of the decisions were Crown appeals with the limitation that results in using them as comparisons even if it was regarded as appropriate to compare the results in other cases. Of some significance, however, is what Adams J (with whom Handley AJA and Howie AJ agreed) said in McCarthy:
	


[76]   In Cahyadi v R [2007] NSWCCA 1; 168 A Crim R 41 the approach to the question of accumulation and concurrency was (if I may respectfully say so) aptly summarised by Howie J (with whom the other members of the court agreed) as follows:

[27] In any event there is no general rule that determines whether sentences ought to be imposed concurrently or consecutively. The issue is determined by the application of the principle of totality of criminality: can the sentence for one offence comprehend and reflect the criminality for the other offence? If it can, the sentences ought to be concurrent otherwise there is a risk that the combined sentences will exceed that which is warranted to reflect the total criminality of the two offences. If not, the sentences should be at least partly cumulative otherwise there is a risk that the total sentence will fail to reflect the total criminality of the two offences. This is so regardless of whether the two offences represent two discrete acts of criminality or can be regarded as part of a single episode of criminality. Of course it is more likely that, where the offences are discrete and independent criminal acts, the sentence for one offence cannot comprehend the criminality of the other. Similarly, where they are part of a single episode of criminality with common factors, it is more likely that the sentence for one of the offences will reflect the criminality of both.

…

[78] The fundamental problem in the present case, in common with many cases where there are a number of offences for which an offender must be sentenced, is not so much whether the offences are completely separate occasions of criminality or part of one or more criminal enterprises but, rather, how to structure the sentences so that the ultimate overall sentence and non-parole period appropriately reflect the total criminality. It is also important, in cases where discounts have been applied, to ensure that the accumulation does not effectively reduce the discount, in short to take away with one hand what has been given by the other.

[79] It seems to me that, in the present case the most useful approach is to identify the overall sentence which reflects the totality of the applicant’s criminality and adjust the accumulation of the sentences as necessary to yield that result. In undertaking this task, it will follow that issues of distinct offences must be substantially disregarded, though this consideration will have played its part in the determination of the appropriate overall sentence.


	
	The starting point, therefore, in the present case should be the overall sentence imposed. The overall sentence was 11 years 3 months with a non-parole period of 8 years and 3 months, but a discount was given for a late plea of 12½%. Bearing in mind the discount, the overall sentence might otherwise have been something in the order of 13 years.
	
	
	A number of matters suggest that the overall sentence and, therefore, the structure of the sentences, should not be interfered with.
	
	
	First, as the Sentencing Judge pointed out, the offences were very serious indeed. They involved actual violence and not just the threat of violence. The telephone intercepts demonstrated the level of planning involved. The offence, the subject of Count 3, involved the theft of more than $19,000. Further, one of the offences on the Form 1 was a serious offence of aggravated break and enter with intent. It was only that the offenders were confronted which meant that they failed in their attempt to steal the proceeds of the night’s trading at the Earlwood Club.
	
	
	Secondly, the fact that the offences comprising Counts 2 and 3 were committed in close proximity in time cannot mean necessarily that the accumulation provide for Count 3 was excessive. In R v Nguyen [2007] NSWCCA 14 Howie J said:
	


[12]   It seems obvious from a number of matters that have been before this Court recently, that there is abroad an insufficient understanding of the principles of totality and of the relevant factors to be taken into account when determining whether to order that sentences be served concurrently or made, at least, partially cumulative. There is no rule that sentences for offences committed on the same day or in the same criminal enterprise should be served concurrently. The issue has been considered in a number of decisions of this Court that should make it plain that the question to be asked is whether the criminality of one offence can be encompassed in the criminality of the other offence…


	
	Thirdly, the Applicant had few subjective matters in his favour. It was true that he had largely not offended for some years prior to these offences, but where the Sentencing Judge rejected his evidence and the evidence contained in the psychologist’s report, there was little to provide the basis for any leniency from the subjective factors.
	
	
	Finally, the Sentencing Judge gave particular consideration to the issue of totality and accumulation as is apparent from the passage set out at [45] above. His Honour correctly summarised the principles derived from cases such as Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57; (1998) 194 CLR 610, Mill v R (1988) 166 CLR 59 and Johnson v The Queen. Beyond that, the matter is ultimately one of discretion as Rothman J (Whealy JA and Davies J agreeing) said in JT v R [2012] NSWCCA 133:
	


[71]   The exercise involved in determining accumulation and concurrence and the application of the principles of totality are inconsistent with the proposition that one single correct answer will be derived in every circumstance by every judge. The application of the principle of totality is an exercise of discretion, intuitive or instinctive synthesis, and cannot be conducted arithmetically…


	
	The Applicant does not show that the Sentencing Judge’s discretion miscarried. In those circumstances the appeal must fail.
	


Conclusion


	
	I propose the following orders:
	


(1)   Leave to appeal granted.

(2)   Appeal dismissed.


	
	BELLEW J:   I agree with Davies J.

		31 March 2015",2015-03-30 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2703665,R v Milsom [2015] NSWDC 138,"SENTENCE


	
	On 3 May 2013, Mr Milsom pleaded guilty to one offence in an indictment. The plea was entered on arraignment. The offence is as follows: on 18 April 2012 at Glebe in the State of New South Wales being armed with an offensive weapon, namely an axe, did rob Gurmit Singh of certain property, namely a sum of cash, a number of packets of cigarettes and a quantity of telephone credits, the property of Gurmit Singh, and at the time of that robbery did wound the said Gurmit Singh.
	
	
	He had been committed for trial on 11 October 2012.
	
	
	The offence is contrary to s 98 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). The maximum penalty prescribed for the offence is imprisonment for 25 years. The legislature has prescribed a standard non-parole period of seven years.
	
	
	I convict him of this offence.
	


PLEA OF GUILTY


	
	The plea of guilty was not entered at the earliest opportunity. The plea, as already noted, was entered on arraignment. I am of the view a reduction of 15 percent for utilitarian considerations only is appropriate.
	
	
	I am also satisfied he is entitled to the mitigating factor found in s 21A(3)(i) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW), which provides as follows:
	


“the remorse shown by the offender for the offence, but only if:

(i)   the offender has provided evidence that he or she has accepted responsibility for his or her actions, and

(ii)   the offender has acknowledged any injury, loss or damage caused by his or her actions or made reparation for such injury, loss or damage (or both)”.


	
	I am firmly of the view both of these considerations have been more than satisfied in this case. Even though it being a feature of mitigation, it only need be proved on the balance of probabilities.
	
	
	In this case, the prisoner has accepted facts relating to the offence outside his own personal knowledge. I accept he does not remember clearly the offence. I accept the defence submission this goes to accepting responsibility and his remorse.
	
	
	He also gave evidence about this matter, which I accept, at transcript p 91 line 20ff of 30 January 2015:
	


“Q.   What do you think about what you did to this fellow?

A.   It was – well, it’s devastating. When I found out what had happened to him, yeah, I was, I couldn’t believe it because I kind of didn’t know him personally, but I used to deal with him pretty much every day and so, yeah, I couldn’t--

Q.   If you had to describe the emotions or the feelings that you had about your own analysis of your criminal conduct, do it now?

A.   Yeah, just shameful and, yeah, just really ashamed for all my family and friends and, you know, I have hurt everyone.

Q.   Have you thought about him?

A.   Yeah, yeah.

Q.   You drafted a letter of apology which is in the papers.”


	
	I also take into account and accept the content of the apology letter, which is the second item within defence exhibit 2, first written on 6 July 2012.
	
	
	Further, I accept the evidence of his sister, found at transcript p 130 lines 12-25 of 30 January 2015, which is as follows:
	


“Q.   How would you describe your brother’s attitude to his own conduct when he did what he did in this instance?

A.   He has been filled with shame, and you know, remorse. He has seen the impact on everyone around him, let alone his own feelings of what he - you know - what he did that night.

Q.   Has he talked about the fellow he attacked?

A.   He did at the time, yes, when I first saw him, when I visited him in gaol when he was initially arrested and taken to Silverwater.

Q.   What did he have to say?

A.   He just sobbed, said ‘I can’t believe I did this to him. He would have been terrified. I hope I can at some stage make contact and apologise for what I did.’”


	
	He also made admissions in the electronically recorded interview with a suspected person dated 18 April 2012, exhibit B.
	


FACTS


	
	The factual context of the offence is found in a statement of agreed facts which is as follows:
	


“During the evening of the 17 April 2012 the co-offender James Simon visited the offender Nigel Milsom at his house in Queen Street, Glebe. Simon had become acquainted with Milsom, who is 10 years his senior, through his father.

Milsom and Simon spent the evening together well into the early hours of the morning of 18 April 2012. Milsom and Simon discussed and agreed to ‘do a job’. Milsom grabbed a hand axe which he had purchased at Bunnings Warehouse the previous day and placed it in the pocket of his cargo shorts. The axe was steel with rubber covering the handle. The blade of the axe is about five centimetres in length, curved and sharpened around the edges.

Milsom and Simon decided to go to the 7-Eleven store on Cowper Street.

This 7-Eleven store is located at the corner of Cowper Street and Glebe Point Road. It is within short walking distance (about 200 metres) from Milsom’s house at Queen Street. Both Simon and Milsom had been to the store on previous occasions as customers. The store has a glass latched entry door with the service counter located in the top left corner of the shop. The main area of the store is on the right side of the entrance with an aisle of merchandise along the middle and drink and food refrigerators along the side wall. A combined storage and staff room is located at the rear left side of this main room and can only be accessed by a staff member through the wooden security door.

About 2.45am 18 April 2012 Milsom walked into the store followed by Simon. The staff member on duty, Mr Gurmit Singh, was sitting by the open fridge area on the right side of the store. Milsom entered the store first and immediately approached Singh.

Milsom had a blue scarf wrapped around his head partially covering his face. He was wearing a green beanie over a red baseball cap, black jacket, cargo shorts and white sneakers. He walked straight up to Singh whilst holding the axe in one hand, which he had taken from his pocket.

Simon entered the store moments later and walked along the middle aisle. He approached Singh from the other side. Simon also had his face concealed behind a grey colour scarf, with a black baseball cap. He was wearing an army green jacket, blue jeans and green shoes. Simon and Milsom cornered Singh by the refrigerator and grabbed hold of him. They pushed him into the storeroom where he would not be seen from outside the shop.

Once inside the storeroom, Milsom and Simon punched Singh around the head and shoulders. Simon demanded money from Singh, while Milsom demanded the ‘safe key’. One of them threatened Singh by saying, ‘I will kill you if you don’t give us the money.’ Simon was holding a knife with a blade some 15 centimetres long.

As Milsom held onto Singh by his shirt Simon held the knife by the handle with the point towards Singh. When Simon pushed the knife towards him, Singh grabbed it by the blade to protect himself. Singh was cut on his left hand around the ring finger as a result of catching the sharp edge of the blade with his bare hand. The wound immediately started bleeding.

Singh was struck several more times, and then Simon produced a metallic pistol in his hand. (This pistol was later located inside Milsom’s pocket upon his arrest and found to be a toy.)

Simon pointed the gun towards Singh’s face and said, ‘I have the gun. Where is the money?’ Singh, believing the pistol to be real, was in fear of his life and said to them, ‘The money is at the front. I will take you there.’ Milsom and Simon continued to threaten Singh. Milsom swung the axe at Singh’s legs, forcing him to step back.

Milsom and Simon found a backpack which belonged to Singh on a cabinet nearby. They looked through the bag and took a small amount of cash from it. Milsom and Simon kept Singh inside this room for a few minutes before escorting him to the front counter where he was told to open the cash register.

Simon pulled a cordless phone and its base off the counter. Simon then smashed the handset against the floor numerous times to prevent its use. Singh was in such fear that he cooperated with the commands given to him as best he could. He entered the code on the cash register to release the till.

Simon took several notes from the till and placed it in his pocket before loading the rest of the cash into small 7-Eleven plastic bags. The two offenders noticed a safe under the counter and demanded that Singh open it. Singh was unable to do so as he did not know the code for it. Simon and Milsom became angry and pushed Singh around again. Simon punched Singh in the face, knocking him back into the corner.

Milsom told Singh to open the cigarette cabinet and put the cigarettes into a plastic bag. Milsom was unhappy with the way Singh was loading the plastic bag with the cigarettes and pushed him aside. He swung the axe in Singh’s direction in a threatening manner and started placing his preferred brands of cigarettes into the plastic bag himself. Singh was forced into a corner while both Simon and Milsom loaded the cigarettes and cash into plastic bags.

Milsom also found a bundle of Vodaphone phone credit codes on the counter, which he pocketed.

Milsom saw another cabinet next to the safe. He tried to force the cabinet open by hacking at it with his axe but was unsuccessful. Simon and Milsom remained inside the store for about 10 minutes.

The entire incident was recorded on the surveillance cameras inside the store.

During the robbery, a witness was walking along Glebe Point [Road] with the intention of going inside the 7-Eleven. He heard male voices inside and saw Simon and Milsom with their faces concealed and weapons in their hands. He became fearful for his own safety and walked past the store down Glebe Point Road towards Parramatta Road. As he hurried past, he heard a loud male voice coming from the inside of the store saying ‘open it up or we’ll shoot you.’ The witness waved a taxi down. The taxi driver contacted the police. Police arrived on the scene with full lights and sirens a short time later.

Simon and Milsom heard the sirens and ran out the door carrying the cash and cigarettes. They initially went down Cowper Street, dropping the plastic bags containing the cash and the cigarettes in front of the store. They were intercepted by police, forcing them to split up and run back in the opposite direction on Glebe Point Road. Police established a perimeter around the store and nearby streets. This was also captured on the external surveillance cameras.

Milsom ran south along Glebe Point Road and was apprehended by a number of police officers at the intersection with Francis Street.

Police seized the axe Milsom was holding just prior to his arrest. A further search of Milsom resulted in police locating the knife and the ‘firearm’ used in the offence. A bundle of Vodaphone credits and some cigarettes were found inside his pockets.

Simon ran north on Glebe Point Road, before crossing over to the other side into Derwent Lane. Police pursued him on foot and caught up with him as he was trying to jump a back fence of residential premises. Police drew their firearms and challenged Simon. He surrendered to them. He was arrested and cautioned. Police recovered an amount of cash Simon had taken from the cash register inside his pants pocket.

Police became concerned that Simon was at risk of self-harm. He was conveyed to Royal Prince Alfred Hospital around 3.15am for a mental health assessment.

Meanwhile, police organised an ambulance to take Singh to Sydney Hospital. He was in pain from a number of bruises he sustained around his face, shoulders and arms as well as from the wound on his left ring finger. He was treated by a doctor on duty who prescribed him with analgesic medication. He received four stitches for the wound. He was discharged from the hospital shortly afterwards.

Singh was traumatised and distraught from the experience and was unable to return to work for several days.

Milsom was taken to Newtown Police Station, where his rights were explained to him. He agreed to participate in an electronically recorded interview, in which he admitted the offence. He was later charged.

Simon was discharged from the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital the same day and was taken to Newtown Police Station.

Simon declined to participate in an electronically [recorded] interview.

The property taken in the robbery included the sum of $644.00 in cash, 18 packets of cigarettes valued at $294.00, and Vodaphone credits valued at $918.00. Of this, all but $67.00 in cash was recovered by police and returned to the owner.”


	
	It is clear from this factual statement this is an objectively serious instance or example of an offence contrary to s 98: Simpson v R [2014] NSWCCA 23 at [25]-[27] (Hoeben CJ at CL); Campbell v R [2014] NSWCCA 102 at [27]-[33] (Simpson J).
	
	
	It is the position that the wounding was very much at the lower end of the scale, if not the lowest, and that must be taken into account. I also accept the purchase of the axe was not in preparation for any robbery and there was minimal planning. As against that, the offence was committed in company and there was more than one weapon used and there was actual violence inflicted on the victim. This occurred over a 10 minute period. Further, a metallic pistol found later to be a toy was used by the co-offender to threaten the victim at the same time the prisoner waved the axe towards him.
	
	
	The victim was a vulnerable person working at night: s 21A(2)(l) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.
	
	
	I am of this view already noted that this is an objectively serious instance or example of an offence contrary to s 98, giving consideration only to the objective seriousness of the offence without reference to matters personal to the prisoner, including his mental condition: s 54A(2) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. In GN v R [2012] NSWCCA 96, Basten JA said at [12], with Blanch J agreeing at [18]:
	


“Usually the ‘objective seriousness’ of the offence is equated with the level of moral culpability of the offender. However, although the circumstances of the offence may justify the description of being ‘in the middle of the range of objective seriousness’ for such an offence, in the language of s 54A(2) of the Sentencing Procedure Act, where the personal characteristics of the offender reduce the level of moral culpability, that description does not identify the level of moral culpability: see Muldrock at [54].”


	
	The standard non-parole period is a guidepost, together with the maximum penalty.
	
	
	The Crown in her careful written submissions gave consideration to the guideline in R v Henry and Ors [1999] NSWCCA 111; 46 NSWLR 34; 106 A Crim R 149. I have taken into account those submissions.
	
	
	This of course is an offence not contrary to s 97(1). Rather, the more serious offence contrary to s 98. It is in this connection that I have referred to the aggravating factor s 21A(2)(l). I am fully aware this consideration is a feature of a case contrary to s 97(1), as discussed in Henry.
	
	
	In R v JW [2010] NSWCCA 49; 77 NSWLR 7; 199 A Crim R 486, the following is found in the joint judgment of McClellan CJ at CL, Howie and Johnson JJ at [214]:
	


“We do not agree that the subjective factors recounted by the Chief Justice and relied upon by the sentencing judge could justify the sentences imposed for either offence even when they are taken together with the findings of fact in relation to the commission of the offences. It has been established that for armed robbery offences it would only be in exceptional circumstances that other than a sentence of actual custody could be imposed. We do not believe that the subjective factors in this case could have led to the imposition of the sentences imposed even had the charges been armed robbery or robbery in company. But the charges here were armed robbery with wounding and they were serious examples of their kind. In our opinion it would be very rare indeed that subjective factors could result in such exceptional circumstances that a custodial sentence could be avoided for an active participant in an offence of this nature. Yet here there were two offences.”


	
	Their Honours were in the majority. Spigelman CJ, Allsop P agreeing, took a different view. What is noted there by their Honours is a matter to which I will return later in these remarks. I emphasise though that the quote is “in such exceptional circumstances that a custodial sentence could be avoided” and as already now stated twice the reference there is to a custodial sentence.
	


SUBJECTIVE MATTERS AND SOME DEFENCE SUBMISSIONS


	
	The prisoner was born on 16 July 1975. He was aged 36 years and about nine months at the time of the offence. He is now aged 39 years and about nine months.
	
	
	He is a very accomplished and successful artist. He obtained a Bachelor of Fine Arts with Honours and a Masters Degree in Fine Arts, both from the College of Fine Arts University of New South Wales.
	
	
	He was undertaking a PhD and had completed a number of years of study towards achieving that degree, again in Fine Arts. However, his supervisor was murdered by his son and this was so upsetting to him he was unable to continue his PhD studies thereafter.
	
	
	He has won many awards and been a finalist in respect of many high level art competitions. He won the prestigious Sulman Prize on 30 March 2012, some 18 days before the offence. He won the prestigious Moran Portraiture Prize on 23 October 2013, a month or so after he was sentenced.
	
	
	It is relevant to note now this came to the attention of other prisoners in his wing at Cessnock and as a result he was stood over because some of those prisoners thought he was a person of means. This made his conditions of custody more onerous and such knowledge would remain with certain prisoners and if he were to return to custody this would also make any further custodial conditions more onerous.
	
	
	He has been exposed to a number of tragic episodes. His sister died of an overdose of drugs in 2009. In 2000, he found his cousin dead in their shared premises, an event which caused him great distress.
	
	
	The following is found in the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal Milsom v R [2014] NSWCCA 142 at [23]-[27] (Hoeben CJ at CL):
	


“[23] The applicant had experienced a dysfunctional childhood and upbringing. His parents divorced when he was four or five years old. His mother regularly relocated the family to hide them from his father, who was an alcoholic. Five of his paternal uncles had suicided. His maternal grandfather had an alcohol problem. The applicant has a younger brother on a methadone maintenance program and his youngest brother abuses methamphetamine.

[24] In the past the applicant had engaged in suicidal behaviour while intoxicated, including three suicidal gestures following his arrest. He ran at a police officer, he banged his head against the cell wall and he attempted to suffocate himself with a seatbelt in the back of the police car after his arrest.

[25] The applicant was granted bail following his arrest and spent time in the Sydney Clinic under the care of a psychiatrist, Dr Samson F Roberts. Following his discharge, he succeeded in maintaining sobriety. At the time of sentencing, he had been on bail for 14 months and he continued to be treated successfully in the community by Dr Roberts and a psychologist.

[26] Dr Roberts provided three reports for consideration by the Court (31 July 2012, 26 June 2013, 4 September 2013). In the report of 31 July 2012 Dr Roberts took a history that in the period before the offence the applicant was consuming a minimum of 15 beers a day with whiskey on occasions. He had used opiates since the age of 18 and his use had escalated over the 12 months before his admission to the Sydney Clinic. He had been using ice for more than 18 months before the offence.

[27] Dr Roberts took a history that all of these substances were used ‘as an escape from depression’. The applicant had been prescribed Zoloft for depression, but had ceased to take it before the offending. He had been treated for depression for 7 years. At page 11 of the 31 July 2012 report, Dr Roberts said:

‘In the period before the events for which Mr Milsom is before the court, he had experienced a relapse of his depression, having ceased antidepressant medication and resumed substance use. Severe depressive illness is typically associated with apathy for consequence, impaired cognition and reasoning and vulnerability to coercion.’”


	
	In respect of his “subjective case”, Hoeben CJ at CL had already said in an earlier paragraph, being paragraph [20]:
	


“It is necessary to say something about the applicant’s subjective case in order to understand the issues which arose during the sentence proceedings. The applicant at the time of the offending was a successful artist, having won the prestigious ‘Sulman Award for Modern Art’ which is awarded by the Art Gallery of New South Wales. Unfortunately, in the course of celebrations accompanying this win, a friend provided him with a quantity of methylamphetamine and heroin on which he proceeded to binge in the weeks leading up to the offence.”

I accept his account of obtaining methylamphetamine in this way.


	
	Further reports have now been tendered from Dr Roberts, dated 17 June 2014 and 22 January 2015. The doctor also gave further evidence by way of cross-examination at the Sydney District Court on 29 January 2015.
	
	
	A report from psychologist Jenny Chapman was also tendered and many testimonials. His partner, now friend, gave evidence, as did his sister. There is a pre-sentence report dated 6 September 2013 and a further report dated 27 January 2015.
	
	
	The prisoner’s curriculum vitae and a bundle in relation to his artwork was also tendered in the defence case.
	
	
	It will just not be possible to make reference to all of the material. I have though reviewed carefully all of it and revisited carefully the totality of the proceedings which were transcribed. Also the Crown’s written submissions.
	
	
	The prisoner has no convictions (in 1996 he was dealt with under s 556A of the Crimes Act for larceny). I put this to one side. He is a person of prior good character.
	
	
	I am of the view this offending was completely out of character. I am firmly of the view the conduct which gave rise to the charge is aberrant. I am of the view he is a person with a non-violent disposition.
	
	
	Despite the Crown’s submission to the contrary, I am of the view he has excellent prospects for rehabilitation. Indeed I am of the view he has made very significant steps towards full rehabilitation already. He is, in my view, unlikely to re-offend. I accept he has not used illegal drugs since his arrest. He has family and community support and has taken responsibility for his son. He has recommenced Zoloft and is compliant with his medication.
	
	
	The prisoner has had a long term history of suffering from a psychiatric illness. He has a well-established disorder of some standing. I accept the defence submission he was in a very vulnerable and impaired cognitive state at the time this incident occurred.
	
	
	He had ceased taking his medication, Zoloft, at the time of the offending. He has been taking this medication for about seven to 10 years.
	
	
	I accept, as already noted, he had received methylamphetamine (ice) at the Art Gallery of New South Wales when he received the Sulman Award for Modern Art on 30 March 2012, some 18 days before the offence, and went on a binge while continuing to take other drugs and alcohol: see Court of Criminal Appeal judgment Milsom v R at [20] which has been quoted already.
	
	
	I accept in the light of all of the evidence the prisoner’s moral culpability at the time of the offence was reduced and consequently the need to denounce the crime is reduced. Further, he is a much reduced vehicle for the principle of general deterrence, although in this case general deterrence cannot be put completely to one side. Also, I accept his mental health means a custodial sentence will weigh more heavily on him. In fact, this has happened in this case and that is a matter to which I will return.
	
	
	I am firmly of the view specific deterrence is reduced if not eliminated in this case because of what has happened procedurally, and the custody and the nature of it already experienced. I will also be giving specific consideration to the course of the proceedings later in these remarks.
	
	
	I accept Mr Boulten’s submission he has had a real difficulty with abusing drugs and alcohol stemming from a mental illness. So the drug problem sheds light on the offence which I am of the view was impulsive and, as already noted, minimally planned. The intoxication affected his ability to exercise judgment. That is not to say I treat this, being his drug and alcohol use and intoxication at the time, as a mitigating feature. I do not. It is though relevant in the way I have noted.
	


PARITY


	
	The co-offender Mr Simon was sentenced by his Honour at the same time as the prisoner. This took place on 13 September 2013, about one year and six months ago.
	
	
	Mr Simon received a sentence of six years with a non-parole period of three years. He was on parole at the time of the present offence, on 18 April 2012. His parole was revoked as a result of this offence. The new sentence was specified to commence at the end of the balance of parole, although on the same day it finished, rather than the following day. Accordingly, his total custodial component is three years, seven months, seven days and his effective total term six years, seven months, seven days.
	
	
	His being on parole differentiates him from the prisoner. Further, Mr Simon has a criminal record. The custodial record of Mr Simon was tendered and this discloses he has been given the benefit of parole on four occasions. He has had his parole revoked on three prior occasions, including the revocation which resulted from the offending on 18 April 2012. He has been in and out of custody consistently from March 2003 when he was aged 18. His date of birth is 17 February 1985. He was aged 27 years and two months at the time of the armed robbery with wounding. He is nine years and seven months younger than Mr Milsom. He also has a juvenile record, including at least two separate custodial orders by way of control orders.
	
	
	He had last been released on parole on 25 August 2011, some eight months before the present offence.
	
	
	He was entitled to a 25 percent reduction for utilitarian consideration, having pleaded guilty in the Local Court.
	
	
	It was accepted by the Crown it was Mr Simon’s idea to commit the offence.
	
	
	Mr Boulten submitted - and I accept - his client was substantially less culpable. His moral and legal responsibility was less because of the inter relationship between his offending and his mental problem and this warrants a reduction in his sentence.
	
	
	The two subjective cases are very different.
	
	
	Further, I am of the view very little weight, if any, needs to be given to specific deterrence and reduced weight to general deterrence in Mr Milsom’s case.
	
	
	Accordingly, there are significant dissimilarities between the two cases.
	
	
	Mr Boulten submitted because of the matters noted and the procedural irregularities, justice dictates his client receive a significantly less severe sentence.
	
	
	I accept this proposition because of the combination of matters, the cumulative effects of these dissimilarities. In fact, in my view they are not like offenders at all, apart from their participation in the same offence.
	


COURSE OF THE PROCEEDINGS


	
	The offence the prisoner committed took place some three years ago. He pleaded guilty about two years ago. It will be necessary to go into a deal of detail to explain why he remains unsentenced.
	
	
	Delay is a significant aspect of this case, even though the delay is not the responsibility of the Crown or the prisoner.
	
	
	His rehabilitative efforts and success in that regard need to be taken into account in his favour as they have been achieved during this period of delay, despite the real difficulties he has experienced from the operation of the legal system in respect of his prosecution.
	
	
	On 18 April 2012, the offence was committed and the prisoner and the co-offender arrested near the scene of the offence.
	
	
	On 27 April 2012, bail was granted but not entered. On 30 April 2012, bail was entered and the prisoner released on bail to reside at the Sydney Clinic for the next 21 days. On 17 May 2012, bail was varied to a residential address.
	
	
	On 11 October 2012, the prisoner was committed for trial. On 3 May 2013, the prisoner pleaded guilty on arraignment. On 28 June 2013, sentence proceedings before Maiden DCJ commenced. Bail was revoked by his Honour. There was no application by the Crown that bail be revoked. On the contrary, the Crown did not oppose bail being granted.
	
	
	The Court of Criminal Appeal found the “revocation of the applicant’s bail at the conclusion of the proceedings on 28 June clearly involved a denial of procedural fairness insofar as the applicant was concerned”: Milsom v R at [98].
	
	
	On 18 July 2013, the prisoner made application for the sentencing judge to disqualify himself. The application was rejected. As at the time of the Court of Criminal Appeal judgment, reasons for that rejection had still not been given.
	
	
	On 9 September 2013, the sentence proceedings before the judge continued. Bail at that time was granted by his Honour, not opposed by the Crown. Although it does not seem an application was in fact made at that time.
	
	
	So by now, the prisoner had gone into custody, been released, and gone into custody and been released again. The second of those occasions involved, as already noted, a procedural irregularity. On his return to custody on this occasion, his mental health deteriorated significantly.
	
	
	It was on 19 July 2013 that the meeting between the legal representatives and the judge in the ante room of one of the courts in the Downing Centre took place.
	
	
	The Court of Criminal Appeal stated the following at [104] and [105] of the judgment:
	


“[104] Although the recollections of the legal advisors, as set out in their affidavits, are not identical, three significant aspects of the meeting are clear:

(i)   It was initiated by his Honour.

(ii)   There was a clear statement by his Honour that he did not think the applicant should receive a custodial sentence.

(iii)   His Honour was concerned about a Crown appeal if he did not impose a custodial sentence and was trying to elicit some assurance from the Crown representative that no appeal would be brought.

[105] The attempt to bring pressure on the Crown representative in this way was quite inappropriate, should not have happened and is strongly disapproved by this Court. Leaving that aspect aside, when taken with his Honour’s express desire not to impose a custodial sentence on the applicant, it provides a firm basis for the applicant’s primary complaint that the sentencing proceedings involved procedural unfairness insofar as he was concerned, resulting in the sentence ultimately imposed giving rise to a miscarriage of justice.”


	
	On 9 September 2013, the sentence proceedings continued before his Honour. On 13 September 2013, a sentence of six years imprisonment with a non-parole period of two and a half years was imposed on the prisoner. The co-offender was sentenced as already noted.
	
	
	In relation to this, the Court of Criminal Appeal found a further procedural unfairness had occurred. This is discussed at [120] and [121] as follows:
	


“[120] Applying those principles to the facts of this case, the overwhelming conclusion is that procedural unfairness has occurred. The exchanges in court on 19 July and 9 September, together with the out of court communication between his Honour and the legal representatives on the afternoon of 19 July, made it clear that the sentence under consideration by his Honour ranged from a non-custodial sentence at one end of the spectrum to something more but not greatly more than imprisonment for 2 years at the other. There was no mention by his Honour, or by the parties, of a head sentence of 6 years or anything like it. On the contrary, the tone of the submissions was consistent with the out of court discussion. The Crown was clearly expecting a non-custodial sentence which explains his request at the end of the proceedings that his Honour expedite the production of a transcript of his remarks on sentence.

[121] The practical injustice is clear in at least two respects. The applicant received a longer sentence than that which had been identified clearly by the sentencing judge in the course of submissions without any indication from his Honour that his opinion had changed in this respect. In addition, he lost the opportunity for his counsel to make further submissions on that issue in particular submissions relating to parity.”


	
	As a result, the prisoner was returned to custody for the third time. On 24 June 2014, the Court of Criminal Appeal heard the prisoner’s appeal and on 26 June 2014, the Court of Criminal Appeal allowed the prisoner bail. On 28 July 2014, the Court of Criminal Appeal judgment was delivered, the sentence quashed and the case was remitted to another judge of the District Court.
	
	
	Accordingly, the prisoner went back into custody on a third occasion and was re-released now on a third occasion.
	
	
	The case was heard by myself on 29 and 30 January 2015 at Sydney District Court and adjourned to be completed at Newcastle on 18 February 2015. Judgment was then reserved until my return to Parramatta District Court today, 1 April 2015.
	
	
	I accept the evidence of the prisoner and his sister that they were shocked when he was bail refused before the case had completed and, as already noted, the prisoner’s mental condition deteriorated upon his return to custody. Further, they had been positively told at a later time, being 19 July after the discussion in the ante room, he would not be going into custody again and were devastated when that happened on 13 September. It must be remembered Mr Milsom and his family were told the judge had said this.
	
	
	Mr Boulten submitted the present matter is a most exceptional case, indeed an extraordinary case.
	
	
	The Crown submitted the relevance of the course of the proceedings is disruption to his rehabilitation upon his return to custody which the Crown stated was definitely required. The Crown said at [46] of the written submissions:
	


“It is submitted [the] fact that the offender has to return to custody again should not be elevated to the sole reason for finding that the Henry guideline does not apply. In taking into account the disruption to the offender’s rehabilitation, it is submitted that care should be taken not to re-litigate matters that were the proper subject of the appeal. It is submitted that the relevance of the earlier sentence proceedings are limited to the disruption to his rehabilitation. The disruption would mitigate the penalty to be imposed.”


	
	In the case of R v Bennett [2014] NSWCCA 197, Simpson J said at [99], in a judgment in relation to a Crown appeal:
	


“Disruption of an offender’s rehabilitation is a relevant consideration in relation to the exercise of the residual discretion: Green v The Queen at 479 [43] per French CJ, Crennan and Kiefel JJ.”

With respect to the Crown, I am firmly of the view the significance of the proceedings in this case is very much more than that. This is a most exceptional, indeed an extraordinary, case.


	
	In R v Carroll, Carroll v R [2010] NSWCCA 55; 77 NSWLR 45; 200 A Crim R 284, Allsop P said the respondent had been “buffeted” by the operation of the legal system. At [65] the following is found:
	


“Since being first sentenced, Mr Carroll has been buffeted by the operation of the legal system in a manner which must be recognised. He served imprisonment by way of periodic detention between 24 April 2008 and 19 September 2008. He was then incarcerated full-time for seven months between 19 September 2008 and 29 April 2009. His appeal to the High Court was successful. On 29 April 2009, he was given bail over the objection of the Crown. His appeal has been extended in its duration by the passing of retrospective legislation that attracted serious Constitutional challenge. The imposition of these matters upon him can be recognised not to be of his making (other than through the commission of the offence).”

At [66]:

“His personal circumstances reveal the heavy psychological burden the legal process has had on him.”

This is the position in the present case.


	
	The Court imposed a further sentence of 18 months, suspended on him entering into a bond to be of good behaviour pursuant to s 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.
	
	
	On remitter from the High Court, R v Muldrock; Muldrock v R [2012] NSWCCA 108, at [14], the matter was described in the following way: “The matter is an extraordinary one.” The ultimate sentence imposed was a non-parole period of one year with a balance of term of two years.
	
	
	The Court was of the view automatic release was appropriate which would result from the head sentence being three years. Mr Muldrock had been in custody continuously from 22 April 2009 to 18 May 2012, in excess of three years. The Court orders were made on 18 May 2012. The three years would have expired on 21 April 2012, the non-parole period on 21 April 2010.
	
	
	Mr Muldrock was never granted bail from when he first went into custody.
	
	
	In my view, this case is one involving actual anxiety and distress experienced by the prisoner. This case involves very unusual considerations which go far beyond the principal of disruption to his rehabilitation.
	
	
	The strong subjective features together with the factual findings made, combined with the procedural history, make this case truly exceptional.
	
	
	Mr Boulten though, on behalf of his client, does not seek a non-custodial sentence. He is requesting the custodial time served, which it is agreed is 341 days, be combined with a period on parole in the community. 341 days is in excess of 11 months, or stated differently, 24 days less than 365 days which is one year. This is a full-time custodial sentence. Actual custody has been served. In this regard, I refer back to what was said by their Honours in R v JW.
	


SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES


	
	I now turn to the question of special circumstances.
	
	
	In R v Tuuta [2014] NSWCCA 40, Bellew J, Bathurst CJ and Hoeben CJ at CL agreeing, said at [57]:
	


“Circumstances which are not properly regarded as being ‘special’ should not be elevated into that category (see R v Simpson (2001) 53 NSWLR 704 per Spigelman CJ at 719; [68]; R v Fidow [2004] NSWCCA 172 per Spigelman CJ at [20]). In order for special circumstances to be made out there must exist significant positive signs which show that if the offender is allowed a longer period on parole, rehabilitation is likely to be successful, and that this is not merely a possibility (see R v Carter [2003] NSWCCA 243 at [20]).”


	
	In my view, in this case that test is satisfied. The prisoner (and accordingly the community) will benefit from an extended period of supervision in the community, particularly in relation to his mental condition and history of drug and alcohol abuse. These conditions can better be treated in the community.
	


SENTENCE TO BE IMPOSED


	
	Yes, stand up please.
	


The sentence I would have imposed prior to reduction of 15 percent for utilitarian considerations is 2 years 9 months. That reduced by 15 percent is 2 years 4 months 2 days, rounded to 2 years 4 months.


	
	The formal orders are as follows:
	


I impose a non-parole period of 341 days, commencing on 26 April 2014 and expiring today, 1 April 2015. The total term is 2 years 4 months, commencing on 26 April 2014 and expiring on 25 August 2016.


	
	I am fully aware the non-parole period is somewhat less than 50 percent of the total term. In my view, that is appropriate in all the circumstances of this case.
	
	
	The special circumstances are those noted in my Remarks on Sentence.
	
	
	I direct your release to supervised parole today, 1 April 2015. The parole will be entered in the Registry.

		29 July 2015",2015-03-31 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2703666,R v Pocknell [2015] NSWDC 175,"Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: In relation to this matter I propose to return verdicts of not guilty in relation to count 1a and count 2. I propose to return a verdict of guilty in relation to count 1b, the alternative count to 1a. I give my reasons and pronounce the verdicts at the conclusion of my reasons.
	
	
	Kevin Anthony Pocknell has been arraigned in this court in relation to three counts in an indictment alleging offences committed by him on or about 10 or 11 May 2012 at Woolloomooloo. Count 1a alleges that the accused did have sexual intercourse with CS without her consent knowing she was not consenting. The alternative count to that allegation is that he on the same date at the same place did commit an indecent assault upon the complainant CS. Count 2 is an allegation of the accused committing the offence of indecent assault upon the complainant at about the same time as the events giving rise to the allegations at the heart of counts 1a, alternatively count 1b.
	
	
	The accused pleaded not guilty in relation to each of those charges and had made application for trial by judge in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Criminal Procedure Act. Leave was granted for the time for the making of that application to be shortened and the trial has proceeded as a trial by judge without a jury.
	
	
	The trial proceeded initially with consideration of evidence “mixed” in the sense of evidence that was admissible for the purposes of the trial and evidence that was admissible, at least at first, as being relevant to consideration of the admissibility of an electronic interview conducted with the accused on the afternoon of 4 March 2013, the day of his arrest.
	
	
	The trial being a trial by judge alone in accordance with the requirements of ss 132, 132A, 133 Criminal Procedure Act [1986] requires the trial judge not just to state the principles of law that are applied and findings of facts that are made, but also to expose the reasoning process justifying the findings of fact and ultimately the verdicts of the court. All principles of law which are relevant are required to be applied and considered are to be identified in the judgment. Some will require little exposition, some will require a greater exposition. I must also apply any necessary warnings required to be made in the assessment of the evidence.
	
	
	In relation to these matters and related matters I apply the reasoning of the High Court in Fleming v R [1998] 197 CLR 250. Being a criminal trial the prosecution bears the onus of proving the guilt of the accused in relation to each count. Each count must be considered separately where it is appropriate to do so. Of course in this matter count 1b is an alternative to count 1a and can only be considered if the court finds the accused ‘not guilty’ of count 1a. The burden of proof or onus of proof rests with the prosecution throughout the trial in respect of all matters requiring proof by the prosecution. The matters requiring proof by the prosecution are the essential ingredients or elements of the particular charge or count under consideration. Of course some facts may be required to be established beyond reasonable doubt in order to establish that a particular element of a particular count has been so established.
	
	
	The accused bears no onus of proof, he is presumed to be innocent until such time as the prosecution can prove his guilt in relation to a relevant count in the indictment. In order to establish a relevant count in an indictment the prosecution must prove each and all essential ingredients or elements of the relevant count for consideration beyond reasonable doubt. Those words are to be given their ordinary everyday meaning. The accused bears no onus in relation to any matters requiring proof by the prosecution beyond reasonable doubt. If a reasonable doubt exists in relation to a matter or matters which the prosecution must prove then I must acquit the accused. In this matter the accused gave evidence on the voir dire, part of which was admitted as evidence in his case. He was under no obligation to give evidence in relation to matters about which evidence has been received relevant to the question of whether he be guilty or not. His admissible evidence forms part of the totality of the evidence upon which a determination of guilt or otherwise is to be made.
	
	
	With regard to the elements of the counts in the indictment I will deal firstly with the count alleging sexual intercourse without consent knowing that the complainant was not consenting. The Crown must prove beyond reasonable doubt firstly that the accused had sexual intercourse with the complainant at about the time and at the place alleged in the indictment although in this matter time and place are not of the essence. Secondly the Crown must prove that the accused had sexual intercourse with the complainant without her consent and thirdly the Crown must prove that the accused knew that the complainant did not consent.
	
	
	‘Sexual intercourse’ has a wide meaning under the Crimes Act, but in this case its definition within the Crimes Act includes penetration to any extent of the genitalia of the complainant by the penis of the accused. As to the issue of proving that the accused had sexual intercourse without the complainant’s consent it is for the Crown to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the complainant did not consent. The person consents to sexual intercourse when he or she freely and voluntarily agrees to have sexual intercourse with another person. That consent can be given verbally or expressed by actions. Similarly absence of consent does not have to be in words, it also may be communicated in other ways such as the offering of resistance, although this is not necessary, as the law specifically provides that a person who does not offer actual physical resistance to sexual intercourse is not by reason only of that factor to be regarded as consenting to the sexual intercourse. Consent that is obtained after persuasion is still consent, provided that ultimately it is given freely and voluntarily.
	
	
	If the Crown fails to prove that the complainant was not consenting the accused must be found not guilty of this particular count. The next issue to be considered is whether the accused knew that the complainant did not consent. In relation to this matter it is the accused’s actual knowledge of the lack of consent with which I am concerned. The Crown asks the court to conclude from all the evidence in the case that it has produced and, of course, that includes what are said to be admissions by the accused in relation to relevant matters, that the accused must have known and did indeed know that the complainant was not consenting in this matter. Primarily because the complainant was “intoxicated” by the effects of prescribed and non-prescribed drugs and perhaps other substances and was in no condition to be able to freely and voluntarily consent to any sexual activity.
	
	
	In a situation where the complainant does not in fact consent the accused’s state of mind at the time of any act of intercourse or any act of indecent assault, because these directions I give myself in relation to consent are equally relevant to indecent assault, might be that he actually knew that the complainant was not consenting. This is a guilty state of mind for this particular allegation and the allegation of indecent assault. If the Crown satisfies the court beyond reasonable doubt that this was the state of mind of the accused at the time of the act of intercourse then this element has been made out. If, on the other hand, the court may decide on the basis of the evidence led in the trial that the accused might have believed that the complainant was consenting to the sexual intercourse with him or the indecent assault alleged by the Crown, whether that belief amounts to a guilty state of mind depends upon whether the accused honestly held it and if so whether he had reasonable grounds for that belief.
	
	
	Therefore, if the court is not satisfied that the accused knew that the complainant was not consenting the Crown must prove one of two facts before I can find the accused guilty. Either that the accused did honestly believe that the complainant was consenting or that if he did have an honest belief as to her consent that he had no reasonable grounds for that belief. It is for the prosecution to prove that the accused had a guilty mind. If there is a reasonable possibility that the accused honestly did believe on reasonable grounds that the complainant was not consenting, then the court would have to find the third element of this count not made out and return a verdict of ‘not guilty’ in relation to this matter.
	
	
	In the circumstances of the matter, although it was not the subject of any particular submission by either Crown or the accused, it seems to the court that given the intoxication, or the alleged intoxication if I might call it that, of the complainant, and of course the intoxication of the accused, the issue of whether the accused was reckless as to whether the complainant was consenting or not clearly arises.
	
	
	The Crown may prove that the accused was reckless as to whether the complainant was consenting or not if it proves beyond reasonable doubt that the accused failed to consider whether the complainant was consenting to the act amounting to a sexual assault, as it is variously pleaded in the indictment, even though the risk that the complainant was not consenting was obvious to someone of the accused’s mental capacity if he or she had turned his or her mind to it. Or, the accused’s state of mind was such that he realised the possibility that the complainant was not consenting but went ahead regardless of whether she was consenting or not.
	
	
	It is the accused’s state of mind with which I am concerned. It is not a question of what I would have realised or anybody else would have thought or believed. This aspect of the matter requires the court to look at what was going on in the mind of the accused and in this regard I have to have regard to all the surrounding circumstances. There is evidence available for the court to conclude that the accused at relevant times was intoxicated. In relation to allegations relating to sexual assault and establishing that the accused knew that the complainant was not consenting, the court is required to ignore the effects of intoxication in the sense that if the court determining the facts of the matter thought the accused’s ability to think or understand what was going on was affected by alcohol, then that is to be put to one side on the issue of knowledge. What the court is required to do is to look at the accused and ask what would have been going on in his mind if he had not ingested alcohol in the circumstances of this matter.
	
	
	This is not a case where the prosecution is entirely dependent upon the truthfulness and reliability of the complainant. In fact, if the complainant’s evidence stood alone, there would have been no trial because the complainant is unable to provide any evidence that would be directly relevant to proof of guilt of any count in the indictment, save of course for some evidence she gives about the dishevelment of her clothing and observations of her person after relevant events. She does not have any memory that is worthy of scrutiny of relevant events.
	
	
	That having been said, I caution myself that there may be reasons to examine the reliability or lack of reliability of the complainant, particularly in the context of herself admitting ingestion of prohibited drugs and prescribed drugs in the period of time immediately before and in the days before the relevant events. In scrutinising her evidence, in this respect, I also consider that it is appropriate to warn myself that similar warnings are required to be given in relation to the three civilian witnesses who are relied upon by the Crown having regard to the evidence they gave in relation to their ingestion of either prescribed drugs or non-prescribed drugs and/or any other substances they may have ingested in the period of time immediately before their observations of matters relevant to the matters arising in the indictment.
	
	
	Based upon the cross-examination of the complainant and the witnesses, no issue was taken as to the possibility of the witnesses having discussed their evidence before they committed their memory to statements, such as their memories may be, or any suggestion of contamination of recollection arising out of the circumstances in which they have come forward to give evidence. Although, I am mindful of the fact in relation to one witness, Ms Cargill, there was cross-examination about her evidence in the Local Court.
	
	
	It was clear from the evidence she gave at the Local Court in the transcript that was produced and the subject of examination that she gave inconsistent evidence at the Local Court as to the quantity of prohibited drugs and the type of prohibited drug that she had ingested during the day of 10 May and that evening, or perhaps the following early morning. I have taken that matter into account. A prior inconsistent statement may be relevant to the assessment of the credibility of a witness. This applies to any witness who has given evidence in the case. The significance of the prior inconsistency will depend upon the significance of the evidence or the witness in the case and of course the significance of the inconsistency, the number of inconsistencies and the context in which those inconsistencies arise. I accept, in the context of the cross examination of any witness, that his or her acceptance of evidence that she had given on a prior occasion that was inconsistent with the evidence in court may be acted upon as her evidence in this trial. This is self-explanatory and I have taken into account that aspect of the cross-examination of that witness.
	
	
	In this matter there is no issue arising for consideration concerning the credibility of the complainant as to complaint or lack of complaint that was made, or the relevance or admissibility of representations of a hearsay character. The reason for that is in the circumstances, or having regard to the circumstances of the complainant’s evidence, no matter arose for her to be able to remember what had happened. It is clear the matter was brought to the attention of investigating police promptly after the complainant had awoken, and it is quite clear on the evidence that she was in no state to be able to make a specific complaint about the accused in relation to the subject matter of the counts. It was clearly the case, and there has been no comment again in relation to this matter in submissions, that she was more concerned about her wellbeing. The issue of raising the alarm, so to speak, and prompt complaint, if that is the correct expression, to the investigating authorities fell to others who were in a better state than she was.
	
	
	As it turned out, the actions of her friends, if I might call them that, who were familiar with certain events that may have caused them concern, the prompt attention of the police, the subsequent handling of the complainant, the treatment of her in hospital, the investigation by the medical practitioners including the sexual assault “team”, are matters that have ultimately militated in favour of the position of the accused notwithstanding the damaging admissions he made a number of months later. This is not a case on the facts, nor was it suggested in any way, that the credibility of the complainant was in any way tarnished or infringed by reason of delayed complaint or anything of the sort. As I said, the evidence is clearly that if there was any “delay” of complaint by the complainant herself, there were many, many explanations for that, and such delay as may have arisen was a matter of hours before she was assessed by people qualified to assess her.
	
	
	In respect of the issue of indecent assault as it arises in relation to counts 1a and 1b, I have already dealt with the issues of consent. It is clear that although not expressly stated in the pleading, the proof of consent or the proof of lack of consent by the complainant and the proof of knowledge of the complainant not consenting are relevant matters for the Crown to establish. The Crown must also establish as fundamental matters that the accused assaulted the complainant. Secondly, that the assault was an indecent assault as provided for in the law, and that, as is pleaded in the indictment, “at the time of such assault” the accused did commit an act of indecency. An assault is a deliberate and unlawful touching of another person. The slightest touch is sufficient to amount to an assault and it does not have to be a hostile or aggressive act to be an assault in these circumstances, or to cause the complainant fear or pain.
	
	
	The Crown must prove also that the assault was indecent. The word “indecent” means contrary to the ordinary standards of respectable people in this community. It is for this tribunal of fact to determine the standards prevailing in our community when deciding whether the prosecution has satisfied the Court beyond reasonable doubt that the act alleged in this case was indecent. For an assault to be indecent it must have a sexual connotation or overtone. It must be a touching of the body in a way which clearly gives rise to a sexual connotation. An act of indecency must be committed at the time of the assault. However, the Crown does not necessarily have to prove two separate acts. An act that constitutes an assault may constitute an act of indecency. The Crown can rely upon the same act as amounting to both the assault and the act of indecency, and that is what the Crown alleges in this particular case. I do not believe it is necessary for me to dwell any further in relation to the elements of the counts in the indictment.
	
	
	Where there is conflict in material relied upon by the prosecution and the defence, it is not a question of the court deciding which version it prefers. The issue is, as I have earlier explained, whether the Crown has proven the guilt of the accused person in relation to a particular count beyond reasonable doubt having regard to the totality of the evidence. In this particular matter the Crown relies upon representations made by the accused to the investigating police primarily, in the recorded interview conducted from 4.34pm onwards on 4 March 2013 at the Kings Cross Police Station. I pause for a moment to point out that in relation to that matter there was objection to the admissibility of that recorded interview. In respect of that objection I handed down a judgment in relation to the matter last Monday 30 March, although the document I handed out incorrectly identified the date as Tuesday 31 March.
	
	
	In considering the judgment I give now in relation to relevant factual issues arising from the evidence, I direct that consideration of my findings should also be had in conjunction with findings of fact, which I do not need to repeat, set out in the judgment that I gave, particularly findings of fact that I made in relation to matters set out at paras 6-14 of that judgment and observations made in relation to the consideration of the admissibility of the evidence. Particularly findings concerning the circumstances of the accused’s intoxication and his condition whilst being interviewed, his condition before he came into custody, his condition after custody, and observations I made concerning the relevance of admissions made by him and assessment of those admissions within the then context that I was required to consider them.
	
	
	Of course, representations or statements made by the accused against his interests are admissible as admissions. I do not need for the purposes of this case to give a lengthy outline of the meaning of ‘admission’ under the Evidence Act. It was clearly understood by the submissions of both the Crown and the accused that certain statements made by the accused were capable of amounting to admissions of fact that were contrary or against the interests of the accused in this litigation, and I will analyse some of those matters in the context of my findings in the earlier judgment shortly.
	
	
	It is correct, as the Crown pointed out, that if the accused’s admissions in relation to sexual intercourse with the complainant, that is penile vaginal intercourse, and biting the complainant on the breast, were accepted as true then those admissions could be used in proof of the guilt of the accused in respect of relevant matters pleaded in the indictment.
	
	
	If I might now turn to the Crown case, to summarise the issues in the trial largely by reference to the way in which the Crown made its final submissions and also deal with the issues that have been raised by the accused in submissions, before turning to some analysis of the factual issues and the related legal issues that arise.
	
	
	In respect of the matter, I naturally have had regard to all the evidence in the trial, both documentary and oral. I need not go through the detail of the various witnesses who gave evidence or the particular documents that constitute exhibits in the Crown case or the exhibits in the defence case.
	
	
	The evidence in the Crown case might be conveniently categorised as being related to three areas, but there is some overlapping of those areas. Firstly, there is what I would call the civilian witness evidence, the evidence of the complainant and of the three people that were relied upon by the Crown as relevant eyewitnesses to events pertinent to this trial.
	
	
	The second category of evidence would be the evidence of police investigations and inquiries and related scientific and medical investigations following upon the work of the police who came to the scene in the morning of 11 May 2012, as well as other police involved in the handling of exhibits and the like, as well as results of medical examination, the inquiries of the Division of Analytical Laboratories and the opinions of Dr Judith Perl, having regard to material provided to her concerning the consumption of prescribed medications and prohibited drugs.
	
	
	The third area of evidence and, in one sense, the most crucial area of evidence for the Crown, particularly in relation to proof of counts 1a and 2, was the aspect of the police investigation concerning the arrest of the accused and of course the interview of the accused that I have referred to on that date, previously the subject of judgment by the Court. Of course I appreciate the interview was followed by the swabbing of the accused and the like matters that were taken up within that second area of evidence to which I have referred.
	
	
	It is also worthwhile stating for the purposes of someone reading this judgment, not familiar at this point with the evidence of the case, that the accused was alleged to have sexually assaulted the complainant, in circumstances where he had walked down with her from Kings Cross, either during the evening of 10 May 2012 or the early hours of 11 May 2012, coming to an area that was described as Walla Mulla Park, an area of grass and concrete said to be in the vicinity of the Woolloomooloo Police Station and located underneath the overpass which comprises the Eastern Suburbs railway. In the vicinity of this supposed park, which is a mixture of grass and concrete, are two unisex toilets nearby. It is a place where a number of homeless people on a daily basis will sleep, using blankets and doonas which apparently are provided by charitable organisations and available for their use from bins located in the area.
	
	
	It was a place, as I understood it, where Napier Waters, Marilyn Cargill and Michelle Murray, the three civilian “eyewitnesses”, regularly stayed. It was a place that CS knew of and on occasions obviously stayed, being well-known particularly to Marilyn Cargill and Michelle Murray. It was a place, as I would understand the evidence, that the accused irregularly stayed. If he had ever stayed there before I cannot say. It was a place of accommodation of effectively “last resort”. The complainant was a person who had other accommodation but on the night in question had not been able to enter her accommodation within the curfew hours.
	
	
	In relation to the way in which the cases were argued and relating to the issues that I have to decide to those matters, the Crown case was that the accused and the complainant, having walked from Kings Cross to Walla Mulla Park, they laid down eventually on the ground, either under blankets or perhaps on other blankets, and there they stayed for some hours during the night. During the late night or during the early hours of the morning the accused is alleged to have had penile penetration of the complainant’s vagina, giving rise to count 1a. Alternatively whilst the complainant was in a state of undress fondling or touching her right breast, giving rise to count 1b, and that he also bit her on the breast, or the “tit” or “tits”, independently of the other activity, giving rise to the allegation in count 2.
	
	
	The Crown submits that the proof of guilt of the accused, notwithstanding other evidence in the case that links the accused to the complainant in respect of the subject of the charges, in relation to count 1a and count 2 is dependent upon the truthfulness of the admissions the accused made during the course of the electronic interview to which I have referred.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that consent was an issue for the Court to consider, both as to whether the complainant was consenting or not and whether the accused knew she was not consenting. Although recklessness has not been referred to by the parties, it is clear, having regard to what I was invited to consider to be the intoxication of both the complainant and the accused, that the issue of recklessness was a relevant matter to consider in assessing the state of mind of the accused in respect of the issue of whether he knew the complainant was not consenting.
	
	
	The Crown said that in respect of the accused’s admissions it was conceded the accused was not or may not be a reliable historian. It conceded in its submissions that some of his admissions were not true, including giving “ice” or “crystal methylamphetamine” to the complainant for sex. Other claims he made were not true or were possibly not true having regard to the medical and scientific evidence. The Crown submitted that the evidence had established that the accused knew that the complainant was not consenting. She could not be consenting because of her condition, and her condition was established not only from her evidence, but the independent evidence, as well as the results of subsequent investigation of the complainant’s condition such as the urinalysis that was undertaken. It was clear that when the complainant arrived at the Park she was under the influence of various drugs and in the words of one witness was “out of it”, as she herself said.
	
	
	With regard to the accused’s admissions concerning vaginal penetration or biting the complainant on the breast, the Crown pointed out that there was no evidence of injury to support those matters. But the DNA profile of the accused connected him, in whichever manner that had arisen, to the right breast, consistent with physical contact with her.
	
	
	In relation to the count of sexual intercourse without consent, the prosecution noted the accused, first of all, claimed he had ejaculated and then later in his interview conceded possibly he did not ejaculate. It did note, whatever one makes of that concession of the accused, the scientific evidence shows no presence of semen in the various swabs and smears, and in relation to the testing of the high vaginal area there was no evidence of the presence of the accused’s DNA.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the civilian witnesses, however, provided support for the fact that the accused was involved in sexual activity with the complainant, relying upon Ms Murray and Ms Cargill to establish the alternative count, the touching of the breast, particularly in the specific detail of Ms Cargill’s evidence of the accused fondling the breast of the complainant and having his hand on his penis. There was also to be taken into account the evidence of Mr Waters as to his observation of what he believed to be sexual activity, and of course the evidence of Ms Murray, where she specifically articulated her objection to sexual activity occurring as she understood it to be.
	
	
	The defence submissions, as I can best summarise them, were that the accused should be acquitted of all of these counts, bearing in mind that, firstly, the Crown was dependent upon admissions which were untrue and unreliable, and alternatively the independent evidence itself was unreliable.
	
	
	The counsel for the accused provided written submissions, which have been marked for identification. I asked counsel, however, to make oral submissions by reference to the document he had provided. The central points made in the particular submissions of the accused were as follows. Firstly, the court cannot be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt as to the truth of the admissions made by the accused for a number of reasons. There was limited evidence to “corroborate” or support the critical admissions, and such evidence as supported the admissions of the accused independent of him was only concerned with “opportunity”, to use my word, to commit the relevant offences. Opportunity was not sufficient given the eyewitness’ evidence.
	
	
	It was noted that the accused had made admissions integral or related to those required to establish counts 1a and 2, but these were untrue. Some of the untruths identified in the written and oral submissions were, as to the place at which they had met that night, how they met, as to the fact that the accused admitted buying the complainant ice or methylamphetamine for sex, there being no evidence of any methylamphetamine in the urine of the complainant within a reasonable time that would be expected to show that the accused’s account of where he slept with the complainant or had sex with her, did not accord with the physical evidence. The accused also gave an account, after sleeping together, of walking with the complainant back to Kings Cross, which was, on the balance of the evidence, untrue.
	
	
	Of course it was submitted these untruths were not available as consciousness of guilt and no submission has been made by the Crown about the issue of consciousness of guilt, mainly because, as it arises in this case, such “lies” as the accused said did not inculpate him, but they exculpated him on the basis of other evidence in the case.
	
	
	The reliability of the accused’s admissions also had to be considered in the context of his condition at the time of the interview with the police and his lifestyle at the time, not only in the years beforehand, but in the days beforehand as revealed in the medical evidence to which I referred in the earlier judgment.
	
	
	As to the civilian witnesses, specific reference is made to the drugs or medications which they respectively were using, including the complainant, Mr Waters, Ms Cargill, known as Aunty Maz, and Michelle Murray. The learned counsel for the accused went through the detail of their respective evidence about drugs and medication that they were taking and there was no dispute from the Crown as to the detail provided, and I adopt it so far as it simply states what the witnesses referred to, save for some qualifications I will come to shortly. In that regard I simply note the details at p 2 of MFI 2 (the accused’s submissions) in respect of the complainant and Mr Waters, and the details at pp 4 to 5 of the submissions in relation to Ms Cargill and Ms Murray.
	
	
	There was some other evidence that reflected upon the lack of reliability or lack of accuracy of the civilian witnesses by reference to the evidence they gave in the case cited in the written submissions. They appear to give different times for the arrival of the complainant with the accused at the park. Mr Waters said that he came down to the park from his job at Kings Cross sometime between 1.30 and 2am and that he saw the complainant and the man who was said to be the accused coming down to the street towards the area.
	
	
	Ms Cargill said the complainant and the accused arrived about 9.30, approximately an hour after she had set herself up for the night which was about 8.30. Ms Murray said that the accused and the complainant arrived just on or after dark which I take to be, in mid-May, around about 6.30pm or thereabouts.
	
	
	There were also differences. I pause for a moment to point out that this analysis of their evidence by the accused in this respect was an accurate analysis. There was also differences that were said to arise in their accounts as to the extent at which the complainant was capable of communicating to them when she arrived at the park. There were different accounts also given by Mr Walter, Ms Cargill and Ms Murray as to what particular activity they observed the complainant involved in before she went to sleep, particularly, whether she was sitting up and talking, whether she was lying down and the like.
	
	
	I pause to point out in the course of submissions it was conceded by counsel for the accused that making allowance for the above matters there was a common thread in the accounts of these eye witnesses as to what was seen by them as happening between the complainant and the accused during the night or the early morning under the blankets. Apart from what Ms Cargill saw of the accused touching the breast of the complainant and with his hand on his penis and Ms Murray’s account of seeing the accused with his hand on the breast of the complainant, it may have been at a separate time, it is hard to work out from the evidence, there was a consistency in their evidence that there was some sort of activity going on between the accused and/or the complainant, to use counsel’s words not mine, “this was activity of a quite amorous character”.
	
	
	There is overwhelming evidence from the complainant and the eye witnesses that when the accused had left and the complainant woke up in the morning her pants and underpants had been removed or at least taken down to at least her ankles and her upper garments had been interfered with in one way or another, but in circumstances in which the complainant could not remember.
	
	
	It is worthy of note that Mr Waters when he was concerned about the conduct of the accused towards the complainant at one stage told the complainant to cover up her “black arse”, the complainant being a lady of either Maori or Aboriginal background. Mr Waters, Ms Murray and Ms Cargill I hasten to say are “Kooris” too.
	
	
	Whichever way one looks at the evidence of these witnesses however, whilst there was evidence of the accused being on top of the complainant at one stage, “looking like he was having sex” to use Ms Murray’s words, with his pants down near his ankles and other observations, and apart from the evidence of the accused fondling or touching the complainant’s breast, there was no direct evidence of penetration and no evidence upon which I can conclude from the eyewitnesses that penetration of the complainant had occurred.
	
	
	I note in relation to Ms Murray’s account of the accused touching the complainant’s breast that she said he, “looked like he had his hands down her top”. In the absence of a reliable history from the accused, given his alcohol consumption, his medical treatment and history in the days and hours leading up to the giving of the record of interview, upon which the case relies so heavily and having regard to the medical and other scientific evidence and the questions that arise in relation to the reliability of the civilian witnesses, particularly the complainants inability to recall important events of the night, it is submitted the accused should be acquitted of all the counts. Including, as I would understand it, the alternative count. Because the Crown could not prove beyond reasonable doubt the absence of consent on the part of the complainant or that the accused relevantly knew that the complainant was not consenting.
	
	
	One other matter raised by the defence relates to the evidence given by Constable Shakespeare that the accused had no prior convictions for offences of a sexual nature. This matter is not disputed by the Crown. It is raised in the written submissions as requiring some form of character direction which I give to myself, but in a limited way. It was conceded by defence that what is sought is a “limited” character direction. That is, I must take into account that he has no prior convictions for sexual assault as relevant to the assessment of the likelihood of him having sexually assaulted the complainant as she alleges. As I said, it is conceded this is a matter of limited importance in the scheme of things.
	
	
	Turning to that area of evidence relating to the civilian evidence, including that of the complainant. As I have pointed out, whilst the complainant ordinarily would be a vital witness in proof of guilt of allegations of assault or sexual assault, this is not that case. Although her evidence has to be considered obviously in conjunction with all the other evidence in the matter. The complainant had some general recollection of events leading up to her attending the park in company with a male person who she had no real memory as to the identity of. Her recollection being significantly affected by the fact that she had consumed between two and five Xanax tablets which caused her to be drowsy and have an incomplete memory of the night. She was too a daily user of methadone and I note the observations of Dr Perl about the effect upon a person even, if tolerant to methadone or tolerant to Xanax, of the combination of both those two drugs.
	
	
	She remembers going to the park then going into a sleep, having her undies and pants near her ankles at one point of the night and then in the morning, after the accused had left, feeling quite “yucky” “downstairs”. She was heavily menstruating I would point out at this time. Her menstrual period, according to the medical notes, starting on 8 May and it is clear that she was still menstruating when she was medically examined on 11 and 12 May.
	
	
	She went up to Wayside Chapel and I had some evidence from the officer of the Wayside Chapel who assisted her. She made no complaint of being sexually assaulted, but she in her own words was, “pretty doped out”. Police found a pair of black underpants which I am prepared to accept on the evidence, including the DNA testing of the pants, to be the underpants she was wearing that night. She said she had been wearing black underpants although she was unclear as to where she left them.
	
	
	She was not given a shower at the Wayside Chapel, she could vaguely remember being provided with fresh underpants. She had covered herself up after she woke up with the blanket that she or one of the blankets that she had slept on and she had to go to the toilet where one of the women helped clean her up.
	
	
	She also had no memory of being at the Poya Inn with the accused some months later, that is in very late November as I understood the evidence around 30 November or 1 December 2012. This reflects upon her lack of memory of being with the accused on the night but may also reflect upon the extent of her intoxication on that night or her intoxication when she was at the Poya Inn or both. She was adamant, however, she did not take methylamphetamines or amphetamines on 10 May, a matter in my view confirmed by subsequent urinalysis. Ultimately her account was that after the meeting with the accused and having had a conversation about him joining her to sleep down at the park, although she denied she invited him to have “sex with her”, she does not remember very much at all.
	
	
	Napier Waters was a methadone user. He used prohibited drugs from time to time. Those matters are detailed in the submissions of the accused. He knew the complainant, as I said he saw her in the early hours of the morning and she was out of it and she was staggering and pretty charged and as I said earlier he made observations of the complainant in the company of the male when they were under the blankets he saw the accused on top of her. He told the male to stop having sex with her. He saw her with her skin exposed on her leg up to her bottom. He saw her “bare bottom” and he saw the accused pants to be down during the time that he was on top of the complainant. When he woke up the complainant was crying and she was ‘out of it’ to use his words.
	
	
	He had a belief that the accused at various times was “having sex” with the complainant but that arose from his position in relation to the complainant under the blankets. The observations of Ms Cargill and Ms Murray were of somewhat similar effect to the extent that the complainant appeared to be adversely affected by drugs or other substances when Murray saw her. I have already mentioned the different accounts they gave of her arrival. Ms Cargill herself said she had a shot of heroin in the toilets, injecting herself with heroin before she went to lay down. At the Local Court she indicated that she had actually taken cocaine and had at least two shots of cocaine before she went to sleep, perhaps three. I could not conclude that she was unaffected by prohibited drugs at the relevant time, but at the same time, the essence of her account is substantially in line with the accounts of Mr Napier, the complainant and Ms Murray, concerning the fact that the complainant was sleeping with the accused, they were in close proximity to one another and the like.
	
	
	Ms Cargill said that during the night when she got up she saw the accused fondling the breast of the complainant with his pants down, with his hand on his penis masturbating himself. She also said that the accused was laying behind or beside the complainant and at various times she saw the blankets moving. She was concerned about the complainant given her condition.
	
	
	Ms Murray’s account was one given in the context of having ingested methadone and cannabis. She saw the accused pushing the complainant down and described her as “fighting back”. I have already quoted the evidence of her observation of the accused “touching” the complainant’s breast. She thought the accused was doing something “he should not do”. She encouraged Mr Waters, who was her partner, to get up and stop the man. Ultimately she saw the man leave alone and she yelled out that she was going to take the matter to the police. She thought that the accused was “trying to have sex” with the complainant under the blankets. Again, as I said earlier, her observations have to be assessed as with the other observations having regard to the lighting and the distance that they were away from the blankets. They variously described themselves as being between 10 and 12 metres away and the fact of course that at relevant times the accused and the complainant were covered by a blanket.
	
	
	There was general accord between their accounts, but there were also conflicts in the detail of the presence of particular people at particular time and the timing of the arrival of the complainant at the park and these matters have to be taken into account in assessing their reliability particularly in the determinations required to be proven by the prosecution beyond reasonable doubt.
	
	
	There was no opinion expressed by any of these witnesses to the extent to which the accused was intoxicated, although I am prepared to accept that I can draw the inference that the accused when he came with the complainant would have been intoxicated, because it would appear on the evidence that he was intoxicated every day at about this time.
	
	
	The accused gave evidence in the trial, through the evidence he gave on the voir dire, and that confirmed the extent of his drinking which was very substantial. His evidence, although it was not directed at the events on the 10 May, concentrating of course on the events leading up to 4 March the following year, seem to suggest that he was a sporadic user of ‘Ice’ which confirmed what in my view is established by the urinalysis of the complainant that neither he nor she used methylamphetamine on that night. He obviously, from all the evidence in the trial including the evidence of police, could be categorised as a homeless person who from day to day drank excessively, sleeping where he could, either in temporary ‘digs’ or sleeping rough. The complainant lived the same lifestyle, in fact they both knew each other from some form of shelter known as the Haymarket Centre as I did understand it.
	
	
	So far as the evidence of the accused from the interview, what does emerge from that is a concession by him that he knew the complainant and that he had gone to sleep with her on one occasion in order to participate in some form of sexual activity.
	
	
	Coming back to the second area of the evidence, this is the result of the police investigation. I have evidence both from the crime scene examiner, the observations of some of the young police officers who came to the scene on the alarm being raised, the medical examination of the complainant, the swabbing and smearing of the samples, the urinalysis and other results of the examination of those items.
	
	
	The complainant, as I mentioned earlier from her evidence, said that she woke up without underpants or pants. I note, if it be relevant to the assessment of the scientific evidence, that she complained of some wetness in her clothing, particularly in her pants but she was also menstruating heavily. From the medical evidence there is no evidence, given the absence of injury to the vagina and the anus although she did have a haemorrhoid on her anus which is of no relationship to this matter, that the bleeding that had been observed by lay witnesses and by medical staff was as a consequence of penetration. Whilst there was observation of “possible” semen or smegma in the right groin area from which a sample of hair was taken and possibly “semen” in her hair with evidence of extensive bleeding or recent bleeding in the area of her abdomen and buttocks, there was no “ano-genital injury”. Although the opinion of the examining doctor was that “the lack of obvious acute trauma does not negate the allegations” and that the normal examination of a mature women following alleged penile penetration is commonly similar to this in such examinations for various reasons, the absence of injury does not establish that penile penetration occurred.
	
	
	I note the sexual assault examination occurred at 2pm on Saturday 12, the complainant of course had gone up to the Wayside Chapel for clothing and assistance at about 8.30am on Friday 11 May. At the Wayside Chapel she did change into some clothing, particularly, as I understand it, obtaining underpants. I note by the time she was medically examined on 12 May by the sexual assault ‘team’ she had “urinated, vomited and had something to eat” but she had not “showered” or defecated. She had not washed her mouth or cleaned her teeth since the alleged assaults. The black panties, to which I referred, had been recovered for examination.
	
	
	A forensic sexual assault examination included vulval swabs and smears, low vaginal swabs and smears, high vaginal swabs and smears, perianal swabs and smears, a swab of the right nipple and cut hair from her pubic region, as well examination of a sanitary pad. Exhibit G, the certificate tendered pursuant to s 177 Evidence Act 1995, revealed that in respect of testing upon the buccal swab of the accused and the testing of all the smears and swabs there was no DNA profile developed from the high vaginal swab and no semen was detected in any of the vaginal and anal smears and swabs. The swab of the right nipple shows a mixture of the DNA profile of the complainant and a DNA profile consistent with that of the accused. No semen was detected in the clump of hair taken from the complainant. No semen was detected on the sanitary pad taken from the complainant, although I accept of course it is not the same sanitary pad, if she had one, that she would have been wearing on the night of the 10 and the early hours of 11 May.
	
	
	The DNA profile the complainant was a major contributor and could not be excluded from the “tape lift” undertaken by the crime scene officer upon the black underpants, to which I earlier referred. No DNA profile of the accused was located on that item. Based upon the various scientific and medical examinations, making allowance from the time that elapsed between the relevant events and subsequent medical examination and samples, it cannot be established independently of other evidence in the case, such as the lay people, that the accused had penile penetration of the complainant. Or that he bit her nipple. The medical examination of the complainant on 11 May and the report of Dr Perl is consistent with the complainant, at the time of the alleged assaults, being affected by a combination of methadone and Xanax, perhaps including also other drugs and other alcohol and drugs that she had taken although there is no evidence of methylamphetamine. Her drowsiness at the time of her first medical examination, which occurred at 4pm on 11 May 2012, was thought to be “due to drug ingestion”. It was thought that it could probably be of a “narcotic” nature, that is the drugs that she had ingested, because she was responsive to a particular medication. The urinalysis revealed the presence of benzodiazepine that is consistent with Xanax, methadone, but negative to cannabinoids, cocaine, opiates and amphetamines. Her hospitalisation from 11 May until 17 May 2012, on my reading of the information, was not as a result of injury or harm suffered as a result of sexual assault but for other reasons.
	
	
	The crime scene officer, Senior Constable Langsley examined blankets associated with those said to be used by the complainant and other items of bedding. She examined a grey blanket and photographed it using an ultraviolet light source as well as using that source and other items. She located a small white stain on one side of that grey blanket and conducted a test with what are called “KM strips” on the stain. The result was negative. A KM strip is a presumptive test for semen. Further examination revealed no other relevant stains and other items. She also examined the black underpants as I have earlier explained.
	
	
	This brings me back to the third area of the evidence, the important area of the evidence in one respect for proof of count 1a and count 2. This is the evidence of the accused’s admissions. Unfortunately, for those that are sitting in court with me now I need to go through these in some detail because it is important that I do so to explain the ultimate decision I have reached in relation to this matter. I propose to quote some of the accused’s admissions by reference to the question numbers. Question 47: “Shall I take you down to the park and give you a root (for money)?” Question 48: “Like I’ve had sex with the lady I’ll have to admit that but it’s not - it’s not in the wrong, it’s in the wrong sort of thing.” Question 77: “We scored ice. We went down to the park at Woolloomooloo, we had sex.” Question 78: “Down by the Matthew Talbot.”
	
	
	In reference to the ice, Question 92: “(We) injected it.” Question 94: “The general idea was if I shouted her a shot we’d have sex.”” Question 95: (The shot cost) “two lots of 50.” Question 100: “We just had sex parted company and I walked back up to the Crest Hotel.” Question 101: (We had sex) “just on the grass near the toilets there is a block of toilets there.” Question 102: “Near Woolloomooloo Police Station.” “I know it’s pretty close to Woolloomooloo Police Station.” Question 105: “It’s where they’ve got all the blankets and all the stuff there where a lot of the homeless people stay.” Question 106: “Yeah there, because we grabbed some blankets out of there.” Question 107: “One of the wheelie bin things.”
	
	
	I note inter alia the accused said, “I’m going to kill this sheila when I see her again” being a reference, of course, to the complainant. Question 109: “Because this is pissing me off, this is going back over 2 years ago.” Question 112, “She’s a slut.” Question 114: “She got her money for drugs off of me with sex.” Question 131: “We was lying on the ground.” Question 133: “She took her clothes off.”
	
	
	And then we turn to a series of questions between question 141 to question 158 where he said, “(We) had sex”. “I thought it went quite well at first. What do you mean what sort of sex did I have...straight on top of her...100 mile an hour that was it.” When asked if he had inserted his penis inside her he said, “Mm.” He was asked if he ejaculated he said, “Yeah.” When asked if it was inside of her he said, “Yeah.”
	
	
	He was asked this question, “Is it possible that you didn’t that you ejaculated somewhere else?” Answer, “Oh this is getting a bit shit, isn’t it? I was pretty wasted on ice.” When asked if it was possible that he didn’t ejaculate inside her he said, “Quite possible.” He said he did not use any protection. When asked if he bit her, touched her anywhere else he said, “I think I bit her on the tits.” He later said, question 158: “I didn’t bite her to bite her nipples off, I’m not talking like that.” Question 160: He said, “I mean, I bit her on the tits.” He was asked if it was in her vagina that he penetrated, he said to the police, “How else do you have sex?” When told that the definition of “sex” (sic) was wide “according to legislation”, he said: “I’m an old bastard hey listen I’m an old bastard and I do it originally.” He was asked how long this went on for he said in answer to question 167, “I’m not sure.” He said, “Because we was both on the ice” (to question 168). He did not know whether he touched himself, he “honestly” did not know et cetera.
	
	
	He gave further answers about what had happened in relation to how he felt. He said that he felt “horny” because of the ice that he had taken (question 177). He said the ice “made me feel like my body was going 100 mile an hour (question 190). He also said that he had been “drinking all day” and that the ice had “sort of sobered me up, if you get what I mean” (193).
	
	
	Then there is another series of questions, between question s 197 and 208, where he said amongst other things, “I turned around and said to her, “I’ll shout you a shot if we can go and have a root.”” He said, “It was a mutually agreed thing”. She brought up the idea of “exchanging ice for sex” said in answer to question 203: that she said, “Do you want to shout me a shot and I’ll have sex with ya?” He said they both discussed and agreed to have sex et cetera.
	
	
	He also said that in the interview that he did not speak to anyone else at the scene and he was definite about that. He said that he had seen her since at the Poya Inn, the day he got kicked out, which accords with the evidence of the police officer. He went on to say that in the interview that where they had had sex was at a park near where Russell Crowe kept his boat “Oscar”, which I take to mean the Finger Wharf at Woolloomooloo, but he later agreed that it was possible that he was wrong in relation to that particular recollection (cf Q101-102).
	
	
	There can be no doubt turning back to the totality of the evidence that by the time the complainant and the accused arrived at the park where they were to sleep the night the complainant particularly was adversely affected by a combination of prescribed drugs or drugs that were prescription drugs that she had taken illegally. And I am satisfied that she was difficult to understand and was very drowsy.
	
	
	There is no doubt that the evidence established the accused lay down with her under the blankets and I am satisfied on the evidence that he endeavoured to engage in sexual activity with her which included touching her breasts. There is no doubt that the accused removed part of her clothing, the extent to which he was assisted by the complainant is difficult to identify. I do not exclude the reasonable possibility that she may assisted him in that regard although she was substantially affected by those substances she had ingested.
	
	
	As far as I understand the matter, and I have taken into account everything that has been said by the accused in his interview about this aspect of the case, on the totality of the evidence I am satisfied ultimately that the complainant was in no condition to consciously or voluntarily consent to sexual activity whilst she was laying down in the park. Although I accept that she may have suggested to the accused that they go down to the park to sleep.
	
	
	Ultimately, I have reached the conclusion, however, particularly bearing in mind the confirmatory nature of the scientific testing, that is specifically the development of the DNA profile or a partial DNA profile of the accused from the swab taken from the right breast of the complainant, that the accused touched the complainant’s breast in some manner consistent with what is conceded in submissions to be sexual activity undertaken by the accused with the complainant in some form. I do not regard the accused’s admission of penile penetration of the complainant’s vagina as reliable or even truthful even though it is a significant representation against interest by him. I earlier referred to the observations I made about the issue of reliability, the use that might be made of the admission and the general assessment of it in the course of the judgment relating to the admissibility of the record-of-interview. I concluded ultimately that the condition of the accused at the time of the interview did not affect the reliability of the representations that he made to the police in the course of the interview. This was a decision made in the context of assessing the probative value of the evidence, not an assessment made of the ultimate decision that needs to be made by a tribunal of fact. I concluded that it was fair for the interview to be admitted and that the Crown had satisfied the test arising under s 85(2) Evidence Act 1995, because it was quite clear to me that the accused was alert and astute to the extent that he was able to answer questions asked by the investigating police and construct answers that he thought suited his cause. He certainly remembered the complainant at the time of the interview.
	
	
	They certainly knew each other from meeting at the Haymarket Centre and he had contact with her subsequently at the Poya Inn. This is an unusual situation for the accused, the alleged rapist as it must fairly be described, being in the company of the complainant in circumstances where there appears on the evidence of the complainant, the account given by the accused in the interview and the observations of the police, there was no complaint by the complainant about being in the accused’s presence. That shows to me that either neither person had any memory of the alleged events at the park, reflecting upon the intoxication of the two of them, or neither person or one of the people present, either the accused or the complainant, had no concern about what had happened. It is to be fairly said, bearing in mind both people have been living on the streets and in various shelters in the Kings Cross and the City area over a number of years before 2012, were known to each other in a number of ways. The accused, himself, was an habitué it would seem of the Crest Hotel in Darlinghurst Road and from what I understand of the complainant’s evidence, and particularly the evidence of Mr Waters, the complainant regularly occupied a seat at a bus stop on Darlinghurst Road not too far away from the Crest Hotel.
	
	
	As I observed in the earlier judgment, it is clear that the accused’s understanding of the character of the allegation brought against him, having known the complainant for a range of reasons and having some memory of having slept in a park with her, sought to deflect the police inquiry by asserting that sexual activity had taken place and that it was consensual. He obviously made a clear admission of penal penetration of the vagina but there is no objective evidence to support either the fact of penetration and/or the fact of ejaculation which he initially claimed with some confidence to have occurred, without the use of any protection. Although he accepted the possibility that it did not occur. Of course, whilst we have no scientific or medical evidence in relation to such matters but it is the case of which I can take judicial notice of the fact that a feeling of ejaculation by a male person does not constitute a requisite condition of the deposit of semen in the vagina. Semen can be projected into the vagina during the course of penile penetration without the accused claiming to have been able to experience ejaculation. Evidence of this character has been given in my presence a number of occasions before.
	
	
	It is to be borne in mind, when dealing with the prisoner’s account, noting the matters raised in submission on his behalf pointing to errors of detail that was supplied by him, that the accused was not a reliable historian in this respect or even a truthful historian in this respect, as he was not a reliable historian when spoken to by police or medical staff.
	
	
	As it transpired it has been demonstrated to my mind that particular admissions made by the accused in the course of the interview were either completely untrue or completely unreliable. Those admissions included the circumstances in which he met the complainant on 10 May, the place at which he met her, the provision to her of “ice” and the use of ice by him, the fact that he claimed that he was “horny” because he had taken ice, the fact that he claimed that after he woke up in the morning he was with her for a period of time before he walked back to the Cross. All of these matters are not true. The fact that his claim of ejaculation, admittedly qualified by his later answers, has not been established from scientific evidence and, of course, the fact that his claim of biting her on the tits, admittedly not “to bite her tit off”, was not confirmed by any relevant injury observed upon her are other matters to take into account.
	
	
	The admission of penile penetration and the biting of the nipple was a conscious admission by him, as I found in the earlier judgment, but it was also a conscious admission designed by the accused to deflect the police investigation. In fact, ultimately it had the opposite effect, giving a proper reason for the police to have him charged and, as it turned out, for him to be refused bail for the period of time between his arrest and the current trial.
	
	
	It is quite clear when one watches the interview that the accused thought by making the admissions he made, that he would be released and he would be able to go off and drink some more alcohol to address the withdrawal symptoms that he started to exhibit in the course of the interview and which subsequently required him to receive medical treatment and hospitalisation. At least that is a reasonable possibility.
	
	
	As I just said a moment ago, when I admitted the evidence, whilst I am satisfied the prosecution had satisfied the requirements of s 85(2) of the Evidence Act and I am satisfied that it was not unfair to admit the interview, that did not mean that I had conclude that the accused was sober, was an accurate historian or was a reliable storyteller. The very detail he gave and the character of the intercourse that he described having with the complainant, had characteristics of exaggeration both as to this performance when performing the intercourse and her reaction to it.
	
	
	In assessing the accused’s admissions, his condition at the time of the interview and what in my view can be seen to be his motives in cooperating with the interviewers and continuing with the interview, even though they gave him opportunities to say that he did not want to continue in the interview, it is also to be noted in relation to this matter that in recalling the relevant events he was being asked, having been a regular drinker of alcohol in the manner that the evidence reveals in the period of time between 10 May and 4 March just short of 10 months later, that he may have had a real memory of some of the relevant events in relation to basic matters, but there is a real question mark about his capacity to remember details of an event that occurred 10 months before. An event about which he thought so little it would seem that he would find himself in a small room at the Poya Inn with the same complainant not concerned with sexual activity, but apparently concerned with what I understand to be drinking alcohol. He gave the interview in circumstances where up until the time of the interview for a number of years he had on a daily basis been drinking copious quantities of alcohol with hospitalisations for treatment for injuries and illness. The contemporaneous records reflecting upon a history of sporadic use of medications. It seems to me with respect that the histories he gave to the hospital in the medical records, which are an exhibit in this trial, could not be regarded as ex post facto reconstructions as I viewed the statements the accused made about what he would do if he had been told that he could get legal advice. As fate would have it, having regard to the version he gave, the objective scientific and other investigations revealed nothing to confirm the truth of what he said about penile penetration or biting the complainant on the breast. The civilian evidence so far as it goes in terms of its reliability and accuracy does confirm that contact with the accused was had with the breast of the complainant, in the course of engaging in sexual activity or attempted “sexual” activity, the precise detail of which cannot be established such as to establish the fact of intercourse.
	
	
	I note one piece of evidence, that of Ms Cargill, that the accused appeared to be masturbating himself at a time when the complainant was dishevelled and he was fondling her breast. This may, as a reasonable possibility, reflect upon the state of his intoxication and his lack of capacity to have sexual intercourse of the character to which he admitted in the interview.
	
	
	Thus, in all, these circumstances I conclude that even though he may have had penile penetration of the complainant at some point during the night that he slept with her, it is at least reasonably possible that his critical admission of penile penetration of the complainant’s vagina was not true. Likewise, it is reasonably possible that his claim of biting the complainant’s breast in the character of an exaggeration was not true. However, considering the observations of the accused and his activity with the complainant under the blanket and the other observations of Ms Cargill and Ms Murray, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that in the context of wishing to engage in the sexual activity with the complainant in circumstances where she had no capacity to consent he indecently assaulted her by touching her on the breast at least once in circumstances where he knew she was not consenting. In my view, because he had no reasonable grounds for the belief that the complainant was in fact consenting in accordance with the direction of law that I had given myself in respect of that particular matter. Thus in the circumstances of the case I have concluded, as I foreshadowed, that I should acquit the accused in relation to count 1a and count 2 but find him guilty in relation to count 1b. Can you stand up please, Mr Pocknell?
	
	
	Mr Kevin Anthony Pocknell, in relation to count 1a, the count alleging that you on 10 May 2012 or 11 May 2012 at Woolloomooloo in the State of New South Wales did have sexual intercourse with CS without the consent of CS knowing she was not consenting, I find you ‘not guilty’.
	
	
	In relation to the alternative count that you, on 10 May or 11 May 2012 at Woolloomooloo in the State of New South Wales, did assault CS and that you at the time of such assault did commit an act of indecency upon her, I find you ‘guilty’.
	
	
	In respect of count 2, the count alleging that you on 10 May 2012 or 11 May 2012 at Woolloomooloo in the State of New South Wales did assault CS and that you at the time of such assault did commit an act of indecency upon her, I find you ‘not guilty’.

		19 August 2015",2015-03-31 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2703668,R v Pocknell [2015] NSWDC 332,"Sentence


	
	HIS HONOUR: Mr Pocknell, you have been following this conversation I trust. I propose to impose a sentence upon you of three years imprisonment, backdated to when you came into custody, and fix a non-parole period of two years one month and two weeks to expire, as I would best calculate it, on 18 April. The reason I fixed that period, rather than directing that you be released to parole immediately, is that I think some arrangements ought to be made for your release to the community.
	
	
	You have been in custody for two weeks. You are no stranger to being in custody, I know that, so you will just have to bear with it for the next two weeks. You will be classified of course. You will probably go out of remand into some other prison for a short period of time, but some arrangements ought to be made for your return to the community in order, not only to help you, but to help the community. Because I have to worry, not just about you, my primary concern has to be the welfare of the community. I cannot lock you up forever, and I am not suggesting for a moment you should be locked up forever. But I have to be concerned about what emerges from your criminal history, do you understand that?
	
	
	I just gave judgment in relation to the trial by judge conducted by me over the last six or seven days in relation to the accused, Kevin Anthony Pocknell. I found him guilty of one count of indecent assault, and the facts and circumstances I need not dilate upon at this point. The maximum penalty for the offence for which he is to be sentenced now, the offence for which I found him, count 1B, is five years imprisonment. I would understand that there is no standard non-parole period in relation to that offence, is that right, Madam Crown?
	
	
	CROWN PROSECUTOR: No, your Honour, there’s not.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: In any event, even if there was a standard non-parole period, what I am about to say would be equally apposite in that circumstance, as it is without a standard non-parole period. The offence of course is a serious offence. The prisoner took advantage of a woman who was heavily sedated or intoxicated. But then again, the prisoner himself was heavily intoxicated, and I take note of the fact that both he and the victim were very much part of the same milieu, although representing different aspects of it.
	
	
	I want to speak, if I may, just briefly of Mr Waters, Ms Murray, and Ms Cargill. They are people who obviously have gone through life with many disadvantages, some of which, many of which perhaps, Mr Pocknell has never had to face bearing in mind their Aboriginality. I want to commend them on the interest they took in the welfare of the complainant and the interest they took in the matter such as to bring this matter to the attention of the police. It was right and proper that this matter be investigated by the police and I want to commend the police on their conduct of the investigation.
	
	
	I appreciate there were criticisms made, in a professional sense, of the conduct of the record of interview and the conduct of the Custody Manager. But, ultimately, as I concluded in the earlier judgment I gave, the relevant parts of the interview were admitted because of the attitude of the accused himself. Because the accused himself was willing to be interviewed. I have absolutely no doubt that if the accused, at any stage of the early part of that interview, had made it clear to the detectives, one of whom is in court today, that he did not want to continue because he was unable to do so, the interview would have come to an end.
	
	
	I sincerely want to commend all the police for the work they did in relation to this matter. The poorest and the most vulnerable in the community are as much equal to the protection of the law and the best efforts of the New South Wales Police Force as the wealthy, and the powerful living in Vaucluse. I believe the complainant has been given opportunity to be protected by the actions of those who sought to look after her, both civilians and those representing the New South Wales Police Service and the various instrumentalities of our public health system.
	
	
	That having been said, as I earlier indicated, this is a serious offence for the reasons I have identified but it has to be seen in its proper context. I could not conclude, although it is always possible that it is so, that the prisoner is a serial sexual predator. His own circumstances speak against him randomly preying upon homeless women. His circumstances really were no better than that of the complainant. The offence, however, is one that would ordinarily require a term of imprisonment.
	
	
	I have had regard to the prisoner’s criminal history. He has an extensive criminal history in South Australia and in New South Wales. I do not know much about his personal circumstances. No material has been put to me from the bar table. But I note, for example, that in South Australia, apart from breaches of orders for him to be of good behaviour and assaults against the person, he has a conviction for armed robbery for which he was sentenced to four years nine months’ imprisonment, with a non-parole period under South Australian law of 31 months.
	
	
	He has convictions of drinking and driving, street offences, failing to comply with bail agreements and assault occasioning actual bodily harm. A number of offences are consistent with his heavy abuse of alcohol. Although I understood from the evidence given on the voir dire that his circumstances in Sydney of being a homeless person, who is clearly heavily addicted to alcohol and perhaps other substances, have largely arisen in intensity over the last four to seven years.
	
	
	That having been said, being homeless and being an alcoholic or “killing” himself by drinking alcohol, are no excuses for committing crime. I note that in New South Wales he has convictions for drink driving, assault, occasioning actual bodily harm, resisting police and particularly a conviction in the Sydney District Court on 9 April 2010 for wounding a person intending to cause grievous bodily harm, for which he was sentenced to three years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 18 months. He is no stranger to being in custody in New South Wales, he is no stranger to being on parole. I note that he has other terms of imprisonment in New South Wales. He has been given the benefit of bonds and the like. So ultimately, his criminal history entitles him to no specific leniency.
	
	
	Having said all that, the bottom line is, the law is quite clear as to the significance of the maximum penalty for particular offending. This is not the worst case by the worst type of offender, and it seems to me, in the reality of the situation with which I now face the matter, that the appropriate term of imprisonment, giving due weight to s 3A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and taking on board the issues that arise over s 21A, is a term of imprisonment of three years.
	
	
	I note in relation to s 21A matters that, whilst the prisoner has very few mitigating factors, I certainly could not conclude that he is contrite or that he is unlikely to re-offend or he has good prospects of rehabilitation, certainly he did not plead guilty there was certainly no “co-operation” with the police. I can conclude as one mitigating factor that there was no substantial harm to the victim, in the sense that there was no physical injury to the victim. What psychological harm she bears from the knowledge of what has happened is of course something that I cannot measure in the absence of evidence.
	
	
	There are no specific aggravating factors that arise under s 21A(2). In that regard it seems to me what arises under s 21A(1) of the Act is most pertinent, that is, the facts speak for themselves.
	
	
	I should make one other point about mitigating factors. I believe it is appropriate to conclude on balance that this is not a planned offence, certainly not part of organised crime. This is an opportunistic offence. Two people affected by alcohol and/or drugs, known to each other, albeit casually, in the same place at the same time, finding themselves sleeping rough together under blankets obviously contributed to the situation. But I certainly conclude that at no stage did the complainant indicate to the accused that she was prepared to sleep with him for the purposes of having sex. I believe that no matter how intoxicated he was, he sought to take advantage of the fact that she was “out of it”.
	
	
	His criminal history, as I have said, entitles him to no particular leniency. It seems to me, in the context of what is the very most that could be imposed by way of a maximum penalty, that there should be some finding of special circumstances. The period of supervision will be limited in context, but there needs to be some extension of the period of supervision, to assist the accused to adjust to community living and perhaps to get some direction in relation to the fundamental issues that confront him, that is, his inability to control his drinking, his use of prescription or other drugs, and his inability to find appropriate housing and/or employment. What his capacity is in that regard I do not know. As I say, I am denied relevant information. But then again the reality of the situation is, as the parties seem to agree, this is a matter that should be dealt with now and not delayed any longer than has occurred at the present time. I make that comment without any criticism of the learned Crown or learned counsel for the accused.
	
	
	I have concluded thus that I should fix a sentence that would permit me to direct the accused for release to parole. I do not believe that he should be released to parole immediately. Simply because I believe some steps should be taken to provide him with some assistance to find either accommodation and/or transport to travel to another place, if needs be, and also there should be some rudimentary plan in place to structure the supervision that will be available to him. Simply sending him off into the street today, which is within my power in one sense, would be a recipe for disaster, as I said during the submissions, for both the accused and the community.
	
	
	And thus, in the circumstances of the matter, I convict the prisoner of count 1(b). In respect of that count I sentence the prisoner to a term of imprisonment by way of non-parole period of two years one month and two weeks. I direct that that non-parole period commenced on 4 March 2013. It will expire on 18 April 2015. I direct that the prisoner be released to parole on that date and be subject to a balance of sentence that will expire on 3 March 2016. Thus, the total sentence is three years, the non-parole period is two years one month and two weeks. That constitutes a finding of ‘special circumstances’ pursuant to s 44 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 for the reasons I have earlier outlined shortly in my judgment. I will leave the issue of the appropriate conditions of supervision for the prisoner to the expertise of the Parole Authority.
	
	
	SEETO: Your Honour, might I just check, your Honour said non-parole period of two years one month and two weeks?
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Two weeks, starting from‑‑
	
	
	SEETO: At one stage you said one year.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Did I? I meant two years. He’s obviously been in custody - in fact I think I heard myself say that, too, Madam Crown, and I apologise. No it’s a non-parole period of two years one month and two weeks commencing on 4 March 2013, expiring on 18 April 2015. I direct that the accused be released to parole on 18 April 2015. That order’s been signed.
	
	
	Mr Pocknell, do you understand the order I’ve made? You should be released to parole on 18 April. Hopefully the parole authority will have the opportunity in the next fortnight to consider your case and to fix appropriate conditions for your release to supervision. What you do when you are released is going to be a matter for you. What power you have to avoid drinking alcohol and all those things are going to be matters for you in conjunction with those that are going to assist you. But you know as well as I do, if you go back into the streets and continue the way you were living, your death is going to come sooner than it otherwise will. But unfortunately, too, you’re going to create troubles for yourself and other people that will lead you back to Court inevitably.

2703686,Application by Roger Cheney pursuant to s 78 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (No 1) [2015] NSWSC 291,"Judgment


	
	Roger David Cheney (the applicant) applies pursuant to s 78 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW) (the Act) for an inquiry into his conviction in relation to 13 offences including kidnapping and aggravated sexual assault. The convictions have been subject to previous appeals, applications for review and claims for executive clemency.
	
	
	The offences were summarised by Shaw J in R v Cheney [2004] NSWSC 104 at [4]:
	


“Broadly speaking, the allegations against the petitioner fall into a number of categories. First there are incidents of sexual molestation, including forcible cunnillingus upon a nine-year-old girl. There were alleged to be other offences involving touching of the vagina. Other allegations involved the theft of a handbag, which apparently contained a wallet, credit cards, a purse, a pen, earrings, cosmetics and a small amount of cash. Other incidents involved, it is alleged, kidnapping, indecent assault and penile penetration of the vagina, the mouth and digital penetration of the vagina.”


	
	In R v Cheney [1999] NSWCCA 312, Newman J summarised the allegations and the prosecution case as follows (at [8]-[27]):
	


“8. The appellant and his girlfriend, Julie Bird were in the Port Macquarie district during the period when the offences were committed. Julie Bird gave evidence that in that time, the appellant would go out at night and, on occasions, return in the early hours of the morning.

In respect of counts 1-5

9. On one of those occasions, on the night of 20 November 1993 the appellant through the rear screen door, entered the bedroom of the complainant, M, which she was sharing with a family friend in her parents’ home at Port Macquarie. She was then aged nine years. He woke her up and told her his name was “Jimmy” and to be quiet or the monster would get her. He then picked her up and placed her bedspread over her head and forcibly took her into the rear yard, behind a shed. While in the rear yard the appellant forcibly made the victim suck his penis. He also touched her in the area of the vagina. He told her to go back to bed and go to sleep and not to tell anyone or the monster would get her. She went back to bed and didn’t tell her parents on that day. When the victim awoke in the morning she found the rear door open.

10. She described the offender as being about the same age as her step father (35-40) wearing black clothing, a black beanie/balaclava.

11. On 20 December 1993 this victim was shown one beanie, one balaclava and one peaked cap, all the property of the appellant. She identified the black beanie as being the same as the beanie the offender wore on the night of this offence.

12. On the night of 27 November 1993 the appellant returned to the house and gained entry by forcing the lounge room window. Whilst inside he went to the victim’s bedroom, woke her and told her it was “Jimmy” and “Have you been a good girl.” He tickled her and attempted to touch her on the vagina. The victim screamed and the appellant fled the house. The victim has informed police he was the same person who entered the house the week before and took her against her will to the rear yard and forcibly made her perform oral sex on him.

13. S, the complainant’s mother gave evidence that her daughter was born on 26 September 1983. She said that on 28 November 1993 the complainant told her that “Jimmy is back…” and that he had touched her on the vagina a week ago.

14. On 7 December 1993 the appellant again left the camp he was sharing with Julie Bird and drove his Holden utility to the vicinity of the Vacation Village Resort in Port Macquarie.

In respect of count 6

15. On 7 December 1993 the appellant then broke into unit 6A by removing the flyscreen in the Vacation Village Resort which was occupied by Julie-Anne Cookson at that time.

16. Julie-Anne Cookson gave evidence that on 7 December 1993 she and her husband, George Jenkins were staying at Unit 6A. At about 9.45 pm on that day she had left the unit. Prior to her leaving, she left the lights and television on but the back door was unlocked. She returned to her unit and found that her handbag was missing and it contained one wallet, three credit cards, one purse, one silver pen, two sets of sterling silver earrings, cosmetics, and one ten dollar note.

In respect of count 7

17. Ian Gett gave evidence that on 7 December 1993 he was staying in Unit 6B at the Vacation Village Resort. He left his unit earlier in the evening on that night and returned at about 9.45 pm. He noticed that a Holden utility park at the back about 100 metres from the entrance to the village. Later he and his wife, Kathy left the unit and were walking towards the lounge. He passed the unit next to him Unit 6A and saw a tall figure which was dressed in black. That figure went from the main bedroom into the second bedroom. He could hear the flyscreen being removed on a window. He then saw that person come out of the unit through a window and walk towards the gate. He said “What are you doing?” He kept on walking through the gate and didn’t respond to him at all. He could not get through the gate and was hiding behind a tree. He followed him to a point when the appellant pointed a silver revolver at Gett and he said something to him. He became scared and could not recall what he said. As the light was shining on the revolver and he could see it clearly. He then said “OK mate, it’s yours, you can have it, I’m out of here.” He had his hands in the air at that time. On 9 December 1993 he identified that revolver at the police station shown to him by Det Francisco.

In respect of count 8

18. About 2 am on Wednesday, 8 December 1993, the appellant removed the flyscreen and climbed through a ground floor window and entered the bedroom of unit 5C in the Vacation Village Resort. This bedroom was occupied by the complainant A and her brother. At the time both children were asleep. The appellant carried the complainant from her bedroom to a grassed area nearby. This conduct and what followed was relied upon to establish kidnapping.

In respect of counts 9 - 12

19. The complainant gave evidence that the appellant used the name “Jimmy” spoke in whispers, and told her she should not tell anybody about what had happened. After being left alone for a moment, she was washed by the appellant at a nearby pool, and then taken back to her bedroom. Next morning she complained to her parents.

20. When the complainant was kidnapped, she was indecently assaulted, subjected to penile penetration of vagina and mouth and digital penetration of the vagina. In the result she suffered a tear to the hymen, and other injuries to the body and face. Two medical examinations made of her on the day of the incident cogently establish that penetration occurred.

21. The complainant understandably had difficulty verbalising some of her evidence. She was however able to write it down on notes. She was asked by the Crown “did he touch you with any part of his body from the waist down?” and she wrote “his penis.” She agreed that it hurt her. She said that this “touching” occurred on her vagina. It is the Crown case that at around 2.30 am on 8 December 1993 the offences were committed on A. She was unable to identify the appellant but she was able to identify a distinctive cap worn by the offender.

22. The following day he was seen in an area close by the north shore and was chased by a number of people. During that time he was wearing a cap. When eventually caught by police he was not wearing that cap. The next day a cap was found by a civilian in the area where the chase had taken place and handed to police. This cap was identified by A and by the appellant’s fiancee, Ms Bird. It had a distinctive white tape which covered the back tab.

23. He had also been seen carrying a bag during the chase. This contained a black beanie, jacket and silver revolver. The revolver being identified by Mr Gett who had followed him from the commission of the break and enter in Ms Cookson’s unit at 10.30 pm on 7 December in the Vacation Village. The bag also contained a black beanie and black jacket similar to one’s worn by the offender of the first victim.

In respect of counts 13-14

24. Later the following afternoon, the appellant was seen on the north shore with a bag which was subsequently found to contain the Billabong jacket in the pocket of which was a silver revolver. After being sighted by police, a chase occurred during which the appellant assaulted two men, Mr Anning and Mr Hurley each of whose premises he had entered. The two men sustained injuries. In the course of an altercation with one of these men, the cap worn by the appellant has been knocked off, but not found and recovered until the following day. Police eventually apprehended the appellant.

25. He made admissions at the time of his arrest and subsequently at the back of a police truck and at the police station. Those admissions were recorded in a police notebook, which was not signed. The appellant refused to participate in a record of interview or to acknowledge the accuracy of the notebook record.

26. The motor vehicle which had been driven by the appellant (a white Holden utility) had been found abandoned near the Village with some items from Ms Cookson in it.

27. It is also the Crown case that a number of documents have been fabricated by the appellant and sent to Crown witnesses effectively asking them to change their stories in such a way as would allow him to escape conviction as evidence of consciousness of guilt.”


	
	Because of the multiplicity of offences in this and an earlier trial for separate offences (as to which see below and see Application by Roger Cheney pursuant to s 78 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (No 2) [2015] NSWSC 293 (‘Cheney No 2’)) as well as the imprecision and complexity of the documentation and slight variations made in an earlier appeal, the precise sentence and custodial situation of the applicant is a little difficult to unravel. By email dated 2 December 2014, the Crown Solicitor’s office informed me that:
	



	
	The applicant has been in custody since 9 December 1993
	
	
	He is serving a series of concurrent sentences totalling 26 years 6 months and 14 day
	
	
	The penalty for these offences (which was accumulated on earlier sentences) is 10 years commencing 22 June 2010 and expiring 21 June 2020 with a 2 year non-parole period
	
	
	The applicant’s earliest release date was 21 June 2012. However, the Parole Authority has refused to grant parole at each review hearing since that date.
	
	
	The next review hearing is scheduled for 20 August 2015.
	


HISTORY OF THE MATTER


	
	The applicant was convicted by a jury in the District Court sitting at Coffs Harbour on 8 June 1995 and was sentenced by Kirkham DCJ on 22 June 1995.
	
	
	On 15 September 1999 the Court of Criminal Appeal heard the applicant’s appeal against conviction and sentence. Except to the extent that the Crown conceded that count 4 disclosed an offence unknown to the law, the appeal against conviction was dismissed. The appeal against sentence was allowed and the applicant was re-sentenced in relation to count 8, the charge of kidnapping (R v Cheney [1999] NSWCCA 312). An application for special leave to appeal to the High Court was dismissed: Cheney v The Queen [2001] HCA Trans 649 (Gleeson CJ and Callinan J).
	
	
	In 2003 Mr Cheney made an application under Part 13A of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) seeking an inquiry into his convictions. Part 13A is the predecessor to s 78, which is the section that the present application is to be considered under. That application sought a review of the conviction on the following grounds (as summarised by the Crown ):
	


“(i) An allegation that the notebooks produced by the police at the Petitioner's criminal trial were fabrications. It was part of his case that, based upon information obtained subsequently to his trial, the notebooks which were allegedly used by the police in order to record notations at time of interaction with the Petitioner, as well as at the trial itself, were fabricated documents. It was his case that it would then follow that the material contained within such documentation was fabricated.

(ii) The Petitioner attacked the duty books of the police officers involved in the investigation and at his trial on the basis that such duty books were not genuine, and it followed that any entries made within such documentation were also fabrications. He alleged that when one examined the notebooks produced at the trial, they were numbered on every two pages, and accordingly did not conform with what he believed to have been how notebooks appeared at the time.

(iii) The Petitioner further alleged that police officers who were alleged to have been involved in the police investigation of him were fictitious. These police officers were nominated by him as being K. Collits, K. Every, T.M. Thomson as well as M. Cavanagh.

(iv) He alleged that a FACTS Sheet used at his trial was withheld from his Defence Counsel prior to his trial, and that a Detective Lang was able to persuade witnesses to lie on his behalf at the trial.

(v) He alleged that there was interference by the police in vital evidence, such evidence constituting a fabrication of evidence.

(vi) He raised issues with the DNA test results, and maintained that the results were withheld, and such DNA results will prove his innocence.

(vii) He alleged that a police telephone message entry was a fabrication.

(viii) The above were not the only matters relied upon in support of his earlier application.”


	
	In dealing with that application, Shaw J said in R v Cheney [2004] NSWSC 104 at [26]:
	


“… I think that much of what the petitioner says about the police evidence, the numbering of notebooks and the supposed fictitious nature of various police officers is spurious. I do see some possibility of an argument that there is fresh evidence arising from documents from the Division of Analytical Laboratories, Lidcombe Sydney….”

His Honour concluded at [30]:

“In the circumstances of the present application, I see a tangible difficulty in granting an inquiry without knowing any real or precise details [as none were available] about the DNA testing or, more importantly, the results of it. Because the relevance and nature of the DNA material is unknown to me, I am unable to form the requisite unease or sense of disquiet in relation to the conviction.”


	
	On 10 March 2004 Shaw J declined to direct that an inquiry be conducted noting at [9]:
	


“The petitioner has been through the hierarchy of courts in the criminal justice system and his conviction and penalty have been upheld by those superior courts”


	
	The applicant submitted a further Petition dated 12 January 2006 challenging those findings. He sought to rely on (what was said to be) additional material to challenge his conviction. According to the Attorney General’s submissions in 2007, this petition was unsuccessful. In view of the fact that the present application was made the following year, that must be correct.
	
	
	On 27 October 2006 the applicant forwarded a bundle of material to the Attorney General of New South Wales. This purported to be, or was treated as, an application for the exercise of the Royal Prerogative of Mercy by the Governor. This application was also unsuccessful.
	
	
	Although the current application was initiated on 12 July 2007, the applicant’s final “submissions in reply” were not provided to the Court until 19 December 2014. In the intervening years, there have been a number of letters and memoranda sent to the Court in support of the application. The submissions in reply included a series of accusations of misconduct by various investigators, prosecutors and other officials and included a large number of attachments in relation to which there was no real underlying unity.
	
	
	The applicant is self-represented in the application and supporting submissions are made in a series of hand written letters to the Court and the Crown Solicitors Office dated from 2007-2014. Whilst it is understood that the applicant has limited resources, there have been three separate periods of well over a year in which no action was taken to advance the application. This should be noted in light of the fact that there otherwise would appear to have been an inordinate delay between the date when the application was first lodged and the date of disposition.
	


SENTENCE IMPOSED


	
	As I have said, there is some confusion in the documentation as to the applicant’s sentence and release date. In the 1999 appeal, the conviction on count 4 was quashed, the appeal against sentence was allowed and the Court resentenced the applicant as follows (R v Cheney [1999] NSWCCA 312 at [91]):
	


“Count 1:

A minimum term of two years penal servitude commencing 22 June 2010 and expiring 21 June 2012. Additional term of eight years commencing 22 June 2012 and expiring on 21 June 2020.

Counts 2 & 3:

On each charge a minimum term of penal servitude for two years commencing on 22 June 2010 and expiring on 21 June 2012. Additional term of three years commencing 22 June 2010 and expiring 21 June 2015.

Count 5:

Fixed term of penal servitude of twelve months commencing 22 June 2010 and expiring 21 June 2011.

Count 6:

Fixed term of penal servitude for five years commencing on 22 June 1995 and expiring on 21 June 2000.

Count 7:

Fixed term of penal servitude for seven years commencing 22 June 1995 and expiring 21 June 2002.

Count 8:

Fixed term of penal servitude for fifteen years commencing 22 June 1995 and expiring on 21 June 2010.

Counts 9, 11 and 12:

Fixed term of penal servitude for ten years commencing 22 June 1995 and expiring 21 June 2005.

Count 10:

Fixed term of five years commencing 22 June 1995 and expiring 21 June 2000.

Counts 13, 14:

On each charge a fixed term of penal servitude for three years commencing 22 June 1995 and expiring on 21 June 1998.”

STATUTORY FRAMEWORK FOR APPLICATIONS UNDER S 78 OF THE CRIMES (APPEAL AND REVIEW) ACT 2001 (NSW)


	
	The current application was lodged in July 2007 and filed pursuant to Part 13A (ss 474B-474N) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). These provisions were repealed on 23 February 2007 and re-enacted as Part 7 (ss 76-88) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001. There is no material difference between the provisions in the two statutes: Application of Peter James Holland under s 78 Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 [2008] NSWSC 251 per Johnson J at [2]. An application made under Part 13A before the repeal and transfer of that Part on 23 February 2007 that had not been finally determined under that Part immediately before its repeal, is taken to be an application under the corresponding provision of Part 7 Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW): cl.13, Schedule 1, Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW). Accordingly, the application is to be determined under ss 78-79 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW).
	
	
	Sections 78-79 Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW) are in the following terms:
	


“78 Applications to Supreme Court

(1) An application for an inquiry into a conviction or sentence may be made to the Supreme Court by the convicted person or by another person on behalf of the convicted person.

(2) The registrar of the Criminal Division of the Supreme Court must cause a copy of any application made under this section to be given to the Minister.

79 Consideration of applications

(1) After considering an application under section 78 or on its own motion:

(a) the Supreme Court may direct that an inquiry be conducted by a judicial officer into the conviction or sentence, or

(b) the Supreme Court may refer the whole case to the Court of

Criminal Appeal, to be dealt with as an appeal under the Criminal

Appeal Act 1912.

(2) Action under subsection (1) may only be taken if it appears that there is a doubt or question as to the convicted person’s guilt, as to any mitigating circumstances in the case or as to any part of the evidence in the case.

(3) The Supreme Court may refuse to consider or otherwise deal with an application. Without limiting the foregoing, the Supreme Court may refuse to consider or otherwise deal with an application if:

(a) it appears that the matter:

(i) has been fully dealt with in the proceedings giving rise to the conviction or sentence (or in any proceedings on appeal from the conviction or sentence), or

(ii) has previously been dealt with under this Part or under the previous review provisions, or

(iii) has been the subject of a right of appeal (or a right to apply for leave to appeal) by the convicted person but no such appeal or application has been made, or

(iv) has been the subject of appeal proceedings commenced by or on behalf of the convicted person (including proceedings on an application for leave to appeal) where the appeal or application has been withdrawn or the proceedings have been allowed to lapse, and

(b) the Supreme Court is not satisfied that there are special facts or special circumstances that justify the taking of further action.

(3A) The Supreme Court may defer consideration of an application under section 78 if:

(a) the time within which an appeal may be made against the conviction or sentence (including an application for leave to appeal) is yet to expire, or

(b) the conviction or sentence is the subject of appeal proceedings (including proceedings on an application for leave to appeal) that are yet to be finally determined, or

(c) the application fails to disclose sufficient information to enable the conviction or sentence to be properly considered.

(4) Proceedings under this section are not judicial proceedings. However, the Supreme Court may consider any written submissions made by the Crown with respect to an application.

(5) The registrar of the Criminal Division of the Supreme Court must report to the Minister as to any action taken by the Supreme Court under this section (including a refusal to consider or otherwise deal with an application).”


	
	The jurisdiction is of an administrative and discretionary nature: Varley v Attorney General (NSW) (1987) 8 NSWLR 30 (at 48-50); Application of Peter James Holland under s 78 Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 [2008] NSWSC 251.
	
	
	It was said In Varley (at 48) that in deciding to initiate an inquiry:
	


“a doubt must arise as to the guilt of the plaintiff. This doubt need not be shown to the satisfaction of the Governor or the Court to be well-founded; that is a matter for the inquiry.""


	
	This element of doubt was discussed in R v Garry Andrew Bayliss [2001] NSWSC 732; 124 A Crim R 362 at [3] as:
	


“3. Put simply, the question for the judge is whether the material which has been put forward in connection with the application causes the judge unease or a sense of disquiet about allowing the relevant conviction(s) to stand.”


	
	The test was adopted by Johnson J in Holland at [6]:
	


“6. The test is whether it appears that there is a doubt or question as to guilt, as to any mitigating circumstances in the case or as to any part of the evidence in the case: s.79(2). With respect to repealed s.475 Crimes Act 1900 (which used similar words), it was said that this view may be formed where the material causes the person considering the matter unease or a sense of disquiet in allowing the conviction or sentence to stand: Varley v Attorney General (NSW) at 48; Application of Rendell (1987) 32 A Crim R 243 at 245. This formula has been applied since the repeal of s.475 and its replacement by the provisions now contained in s.79(2): Application of Pedrana (2000) 117 A Crim R 45 at 463 [28]; Application of Suey [2001] NSWSC 543 at [18].


	
	Beech Jones J analysed the development of this test in SKAF, Bilal - Application under Part 7 Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 [2013] NSWSC 45 at [21; 24]:
	


“21.… the test to be applied in proceedings of this nature is whether it appears that there is a doubt or question as to the applicant's guilt, as to any mitigating circumstances in the case, or as to any part of the evidence in the case (s 79(2)). Under the now-repealed, but similarly phrased s 475 of the Crimes Act 1900, it was said that the requisite view may be formed where the material submitted causes the person considering the matter ""unease or a sense of disquiet"" in allowing the conviction or sentence to stand (Holland at [6], citing Varley v Attorney General (NSW) at 48; Application of Rendell (1987) 32 A Crim R 243 at 245). This requires available material which ""as a matter of practical reality"" gives rise to the sense of unease or disquiet (Holland at [8]). That formula has been applied in applications made under s 79(2) (Holland at [6]).

…

24. Further, I note that s 79(2) of the Review Act refers not only to a doubt or question about the convicted person's guilt but also ""as to any part of the evidence in the case"". It is possible for there to be a doubt or question about such evidence even if there is no doubt or question about the convicted person's guilt (Varley at 46 per Hope JA; Eastman [2003] HCA 28; 214 CLR 318 at [123] per Heydon J). The example given in Varley concerned the ordering of an inquiry to redress unjustified attacks on a particular Crown witness. However in this case I would not exercise the power conferred by s 79(1) to either order an inquiry or refer the matter to the Court of Criminal Appeal unless any question or doubt that might be raised about the evidence or part of it against Bilal Skaf was such as to give rise to ""unease or [a] sense of disquiet"" about his convictions.”


	
	Finally, as noted by Johnson J in Holland at [9]:
	


“The procedure under s.78 is not intended to provide a convicted person with yet another avenue of appeal after the usual avenues have been exhausted: Application of Dunn at [9]; Application of Milat (2005) 157 A Crim R 565 at 574 [26]. Nor is it an opportunity, in a sense, to run the trial again on paper, with the ultimate submission that acquittal should result.

CONCURRENT APPLICATION


	
	This is one of two applications under s 78 currently being prosecuted by the applicant. Prior to the applicant’s trial in the District Court sitting in Coffs Harbour, he was tried and convicted by Shillington DCJ in the District Court sitting in Sydney (this trial is referred to in correspondence as the “Strathfield matter”). The application relating to the Strathfield matter concerns a proposed review of convictions for maliciously inflicting actual bodily harm with intent to have sexual intercourse and assaulting a police officer occasioning actual bodily harm.
	
	
	For the Strathfield matter, the applicant was sentenced to a minimum term of 4 years and 8 months imprisonment in relation to the first count and term of 1 year imprisonment for the second count: R v Cheney (Court of Criminal Appeal (NSW), 29 April 1998, unrep).
	
	
	The Crown summarised the history of that case as follows:
	


“The factual background relating to these offences shows that at about 7.00 pm on the evening of 3 May, 1991 in Everton Lane, Strathfield, the Petitioner was seen by a Mrs. Long in suspicious circumstances, straddling over the top of a lower figure in the laneway.

She observed the upper figure drag the lower figure along some distance away from her position. Being concerned, she immediately telephoned Burwood Police, and police vehicles arrived within a very short period of time. There was then a pursuit of the Petitioner, who was apprehended during the course of such pursuit. The victim of the attempted sexual assault was apparently so affected by the events that she was unable to give evidence at the Petitioner's trial.

The Petitioner appealed against his conviction to the Court of Criminal Appeal which in a Judgment handed down on the 28th April, 1998 dismissed the appeal.”

CONSIDERATION


	
	In assessing the current application, I have taken into account the grounds and material upon which the applicant’s 2006 application relied. These have been summarised by the Crown as;
	


“In support of his further Petitions dated 12 January, 2006 and 27 October, 2006, Mr. Cheney put forward the following grounds (put in their most succinct form):

(i) The police notebooks were fabrications, and accordingly the information contained within such fabricated notebooks are themselves fabrications.

(ii) The police officers involved in the investigation are fictitious.

(iii) His conviction in 1995 came about as a result of fabricated circumstantial evidence with respect to all 14 counts of the indictment presented by the Director of Public Prosecutions.

In support of his Petition on that occasion, Mr. Cheney presented the following additional material, inter alia:

(i) Letter from Sergeant Danny Webster of the NSW Police College dated 12 April, 2005.

(ii) Letter from Ms. Laraine Tate, Archivist, with NSW Police Corporate Archives.

(iii) Letter forwarded by Ms. Kelly Haggett, Acting Manager, Printing & Design Services of NSW Police addressed to the Petitioner's then solicitors dated 8 July, 2002.

(iv) Statutory Declaration by a solicitor, namely Christopher Jowett, relating to his experience with police notebooks.

(v) A copy of Detective Lang's Statement and also his notebook used during the course of the trial.”


	
	As I have said, the applicant’s submissions were receieved by way of a series of letters with attachments over some seven years. I have considered the material provided by the applicant as well as two sets of submissions provided by the Attorney General. The first set of submissions was prepared in November 2007 with a supplementary set prepared in May 2013.
	
	
	The applicant argues that he has “fresh evidence” not ruled upon by this Court and that “special facts and circumstances” justify the taking of further action. A substantial amount of documentation was received by the Court on 14 December 2014. The applicant makes a number of references to “fresh evidence” within the 400 or so pages of submissions and extrinsic material provided. One example relates to a police report of 8 December 1993:
	


“FRESH EVIDENCE POLICE REPORT OF OCCURRENCE No 93/1013: 8/12/93: 4:00PM: DETECTIVE LYSAUGHT ALSO STATES.

‘IT IS NOT CONFIRMED IF HE (THE APPLICANT) HAS FIREARMS’

IAN GETT COUNT:7 ALSO COUNT:6 BREAK ENTER STEAL IS SAID TO OCCUR HOURS EARLIER BEFORE THE ABOVE REPORT WAS DONE. THIS WAS APPROXIMATLY 10PM ON 7/12/93 IT WAS SAID TO BE REPORTED TO POLICE. THE APPLICANT IS SAID TO BE THE OFFENDER OF THE SO CALLED POINTING A SILVER REVLOVER AT IAN GETT AT VACATION VILLAGE IF IT WAS TRUE FACTS.  THE POLICE WOULD HAVE BEEN AT VACATION VILLAGE IN GREAT NUMBERS CLEARLY IF AN OFFENDER WAS RUNNING AROUND WITH A SILVER REVOLVER POINTING IT AT THE PATRONS. THIS DID NOT HAPPEN BECAUSE DETECTIVE LANG MADE HIS OWN EVIDENCE UP AGAINST THE APPLICANT ALONG WITH THE FALSE ADMISSIONS.”


	
	There is no fresh evidence underpinning this assertion. It is an argument that could have been made during the trial or previous appeals and reviews. If such a submission was made, it clearly did not find favour with the tribunals that dealt with the matter in the past.
	
	
	I point to the “IAN GETT COUNT 7” submission merely as an example. The submissions in reply are littered with similar assertions. The applicant makes submissions based on inferences he seeks to draw from perceived inconsistencies within police documentation. This evidence is not ‘fresh’. It was available at both the trial and on appeal. Even where there is a new flavour to the submission, it does not elicit a ‘sense on disquiet’ in allowing the conviction to stand. The extensive submissions in reply continue in a similar vein.
	
	
	In considering the application, the following observations of Shaw J are pertinent (R v Cheney [2004] NSWSC 104 at [14]):
	


“Many of the matters he seeks to advance were matters which were or should have properly been advanced at trial and on appeal. Some are matters of mere speculation and it is relevant that the petitioner was legally represented at trial and on appeal by counsel. I also accept that an application of this kind should not be used as an additional avenue on appeal.”


	
	I will deal briefly with six of the applicant’s arguments by way of example and to give a flavour of the application and the allegations contained in the documentation:
	


(1)   That the unprosecuted charges of using a false instrument to pervert the court of justice (s 319 Crimes Act 1900) (x 4) and corruption of a crown witness to give false evidence (s 321(1) Crimes Act) (x2) were improperly taken into account in his 1995 trial. This matter was mentioned in R v Cheney [1999] NSWCCA 312 per Newman J at [27]. It was a matter properly for consideration by the trial judge or the Court of Criminal Appeal. On its face, it is relevant evidence going to a consciousness of guilt and the Crown was entitled to rely on the evidence in the way it did. The charges in the Local Court were dismissed as a matter of prosecutorial discretion, as were earlier charges of break enter and steal noted by Shaw J at [18]. It is not new or fresh material warranting an inquiry or consideration by the Court of Criminal Appeal 20 years after the event.

However, along with the other arguments raised by the application, I will take it into account globally in determining whether a sense of disquiet or unease is engendered by reference to the accumulation of matters raised by the application.

(2)   There is “fresh evidence” of the fabrication of Police Duty books. During the trial, the Crown stated on the record that all subpoenaed material was being kept securely in chambers. The applicant alleges that the official police notebooks were never in possession of the Crown prosecutor as photocopies we relied upon in trial. He alleges that photocopies of unspecified exhibits at his trial did not match the originals and were therefore fabrications. It is suggested that Kirkham DCJ was a party to this. This allegation was dealt with by Shaw J who said:

“15. First, it is said that the police notebooks tendered at trial were fabrications. However, those notebooks were produced at trial, and were the subject of scrutiny and cross examination by the petitioner’s legal representatives. The genuineness of the documentation was not challenged although there was a controversy about the alleged verbal admissions advanced in the Crown case. Subsequently, no appeal point was taken in relation to the issue. As the Crown submissions contend:

‘To accept this ground as having any credibility whatsoever would mean that one would be accepting of the fact that virtually each and every police officer who produced his notebook and/or duty book at the trial was producing false documents which had not really been issued by the NSW Police to that officer.’”

Shaw J rejected a substantially similar argument based on material that was essentially the same. Once again, this is not fresh or new material and there is nothing that causes me to believe that the approach taken by Shaw J was wrong or needs to be revisited.

(3)   The applicant alleges that a number of police officers involved in the investigation were “fictitious”. This was addressed by Shaw J who stated at [17]:

“It is next said by the petitioner that certain specified police officers are “fictitious” police officers. It appears to be true that one police officer, a woman, changed her name at the time of marriage, but there is no credible evidence that the supposed fictitious officers, who in any event played a minor role in the investigation, were non-existent. I find that this submission is untenable.”

I agree with Shaw J’s assessment of the matter and, in any event, the matter has already been subject to careful judicial scrutiny.

(4)   The applicant relies on a transcript arising from a NSW Police Internal Affairs Investigation in relation to complaints by the applicant. The transcript is of an interview dated 28 January 1994 between Detective Sergeant Moss and the applicant. In the interview the applicant set out a number of complaints and grievances concerning the conduct of police. The applicant relies on the transcript of the interview with Detective Sergeant Moss as proof that the allegations therein took place. The problem with that contention is self-evident. Essentially, the applicant relies on his own version of the events to corroborate his current allegations.

The applicant said in the interview that “Detective Lang said to me he’s charging me, I don’t need evidence, I’ll make it up as I go and seeing you are not answering questions, I’m going to verbal you.” The internal affairs interview took place before the applicant’s trial and related to police misconduct and fabrication of evidence. It cannot corroborate in any meaningful way the allegations that are now made. The most that can be said is that the applicant has made these allegations and challenged his conviction and the conduct of the police for a very long time. In other words, his assertions that the police acted corruptly or improperly is not a recent invention on his part. I take the matter into account in that way.

However, the material is not fresh. Shaw J dealt with this issue in 2004 and noted (at [18]) that:

“The question as to whether the police officer in question was giving false evidence was dealt with during the trial and was expressly referred to by the trial judge who appeared to be satisfied that there was no such fabrication on the part of the police”.

As I have already said, the applicant was legally represented at both trial and on appeal and these allegations of misconduct on the part of the investigators, insofar as they were relevant to whether the applicant was guilty of the offences with which he was charged, was or could have been, dealt with at that time.

(5)   There is an allegation concerning fabricated evidence relating to the baseball cap that the applicant was alleged to be wearing. The submission seems to be suggesting that because the baseball cap was only mentioned by victims and witnesses after the applicant’s arrest, and because he was not wearing the cap when he was arrested (it was found nearby the day before), the police involved have “FABRICATED AND HIDDEN EVIDENCE.” Once again, the statements of police and witnesses were matters to be addressed at trial. It is not “fresh evidence”. The argument, if accepted, is not persuasive. It does not raise a doubt as to the applicant’s guilt either by itself or in combination with the other matters articulated by the applicant

(6)   There is a submission that a fingerprint located on the victim’s fly screen does not match the fingerprints of the applicant. Assuming this assertion to be correct, it was a matter able to be raised at trial and is most unlikely to lead to any conclusion favourable to the applicant. The fact that evidence is not inculpatory does not make it exculpatory.


	
	The foregoing does not purport to summarise the entirety of the lengthy and discursive submissions and material filed by the applicant over the seven years since he initiated this application. However, it provides some flavour of the content of those submissions. I have considered all of the material in the context of the statutory function that I am required to perform.
	


CONCLUSION


	
	This Court may refuse to consider an application for review pursuant to s 79(3) of the Act if it appears the matter:
	



	
	has been fully dealt with in the proceedings giving rise to the conviction or sentence (or in any proceedings on appeal from the conviction or sentence), or
	
	
	has previously been dealt with under this Part or under the previous review provisions, or
	
	
	has been the subject of a right of appeal (or a right to apply for leave to appeal) by the convicted person but no such appeal or application has been made.
	



	
	Johnson J discussed the history and operation of s 79(3) in Application by Ivan Milat under Section 78 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 [2015] NSWSC 209 at [14]-[22]. The present application raises no new facts or circumstances to justify action under Part 7. The applicant endeavours to re-agitate matters that were or should have been considered at trial, on appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal, in the 2003 application or in the two petitions to the Governor. These arguments have been considered and dealt with previously. In some cases, they have been considered on more than one occasion. However, rather than refusing to deal with the matters pursuant to s 79(3) I have considered the merit of the application.
	
	
	The material which has been put forward in connection with the present application evokes no sense of disquiet or unease about the efficacy of the convictions. It raises no doubt or question as to the applicant's guilt, any part of the evidence in the case or as to any mitigating circumstance relevant to sentence.
	
	
	Putting to one side the question of whether the material is fresh, the material provided does not justify action under s 78 in any event. Considered alongside the evidence upon which the applicant was convicted, the evidence and submissions produced on this application do not elicit the sense of unease described in the authorities as warranting an order that there be another inquiry into the applicant’s convictions.
	
	
	The application is dismissed.

		09 April 2015",2015-03-26 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2703690,Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v Tikomaimaleya [2015] NSWCA 83,"Judgment


	
	THE COURT: The Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) made a detention application pursuant to s 50 of the Bail Act 2013 (NSW) following the release on bail of Talemo Tikomaimaleya (the respondent) by his Honour Judge King SC in the District Court on 27 February 2015. His Honour's bail decision followed the return of a verdict of guilty by a jury in the respondent's trial for an offence of sexual intercourse with a person under the age of 10 years. This is an offence contrary to s 66A(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) and there is prescribed for it a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 25 years and a standard non-parole period of 15 years.
	
	
	The application came before Button J in the Bail List of the Common Law Division of the Supreme Court on 26 March 2015. At the invitation of counsel for the respondent and without opposition by the Crown his Honour referred the matter to this Court. Such a referral was considered to be appropriate in the light of a ""practice"" discussed in authorities to which his Honour was referred: R v Roberts; R v Lardner (1997) 97 A Crim R 456; R v Budiman (1997) 97 A Crim R 548; Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v Cassaniti [2006] NSWSC 1103; and Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v Louizos [2008] NSWCA 220.
	
	
	The Court convened on the afternoon of 26 March 2015 and heard submissions on (a) whether such a ""practice"" remained appropriate given it arose during the currency of the now repealed Bail Act 1978 (NSW) and having regard to the provisions of the Bail Act 2013; (b) the application of the ""show cause"" requirement in s 16A of the 2013 Act; and (c) the merits of the Crown's detention application.
	
	
	At the conclusion of the hearing the Court granted the application and made an order that bail be refused. What follows are the reasons for the making of that order.
	


The practice of bail applications being referred to the Court of Appeal


	
	In R v Rowe [1991] NSWCA 300, Hunt AJA described the practice of referral of bail matters from the Supreme Court to this Court as follows:
	


""… the practice adopted by the Supreme Court (since as long ago as 1979), where an applicant is already the subject of a refusal of bail by a judge of either the District Court or the Supreme Court during a trial or pending sentence, has been for the single judge before whom the application comes to decline to exercise that jurisdiction, but (if there be circumstances shown which may be thought to justify a reconsideration of bail) to remove the application into the Court of Appeal"".


	
	That was a practice in force during the currency of the Bail Act 1978. From the inception of that Act, the Supreme Court had a power to review bail decisions of the District Court (s 45(1)) but the Court of Criminal Appeal had power only to review its own bail decisions (s 46). Amendments made by the Courts and Crimes Legislation Further Amendment Act 2008 (NSW) which came into force on 8 December 2008 (by substituting a new s 45 and repealing s 46) took away the Supreme Court's power to review District Court bail decisions and gave it to the Court of Criminal Appeal. That was how the matter stood until the Bail Act 1978 was repealed.
	
	
	The practice of referral from the Supreme Court to the Court of Appeal of bail decisions made in the District Court should have ceased with the 2008 amendments. And, it seems, it did cease with only one exception: in DPP v SKA (formerly DPP v AZ) [2009] NSWCA 51 what was described as the ""long standing practice"" of referral to the Court of Appeal was applied. This was not long after the 2008 amendments took affect and they seem not to have been brought to the Court's attention.
	
	
	From the commencement of the Bail Act 2013 there is no practical reason for referral to the Court of Appeal of any bail application, whether for release, detention or variation, following a determination in either the District Court or the Supreme Court. The Bail Act 2013 provides a clearly structured scheme for the bail decisions that can be made by each court.
	
	
	The Supreme Court is provided with the power to hear a detention application or variation application where a bail decision has been made by the District Court, the Local Court, an authorised justice or a police officer (s 66(2)). (It also has the power to hear a release application where bail has been refused by another court, an authorised justice or a police officer (s 66(1).)
	
	
	Section 67 provides the Court of Criminal Appeal with power to hear a bail application where, inter alia, a bail decision has been made by the Supreme Court.
	
	
	This indicates a clear Parliamentary intention that bail decisions made in the District Court will be the subject of any further release, detention or variation application in the Supreme Court. If a party is dissatisfied with the outcome there is the potential for a further application to be brought in the Court of Criminal Appeal.
	
	
	Confirmation of this construction is to be found in the Second Reading Speech (which may be used as an aid to interpretation: s 34(2)(f) of the Interpretation Act 1987 (NSW)), the relevant part of which is reproduced in Howie and Johnson, Criminal Practice and Procedure NSW, LexisNexis Butterworths at [9-s 66.5] in the commentary to s 66:
	


""In the second reading speech for the Bail Bill 2013, the Attorney General said concerning s 66:

'Division 3 sets out the powers of particular courts to hear bail applications. I will not set out these provisions in detail. However, I note that proposed section 66 allows the Supreme Court to hear a variation application or detention application where a bail decision has already been made by the District Court. This differs from the existing Act whereby decisions of the District Court can be reviewed only by the Court of Criminal Appeal.'""


	
	The practice of referring bail applications from the Supreme Court to the Court of Appeal should have ceased with the introduction of the 2008 amendments and has no place under the Bail Act 2013.
	


Show cause and unacceptable risk tests in the Bail Act


	
	Part 3 of the Bail Act 2013 is headed ""Making and variation of bail decisions"". Division 1A (ss 16A and 16B) deals with a ""show cause requirement"" for certain types of offences. Division 2 (ss 17 to 20A) deals with an ""unacceptable risk test"" which applies to all offences. (Division 1A was inserted and various amendments to Division 2 were made by the Bail Amendment Act 2014 (NSW) which commenced operation on 28 January 2015.)
	
	
	An offence against s 66A(1) of the Crimes Act is a ""show cause"" offence in that it is a ""serious indictable offence that involves sexual intercourse with a person under the age of 16 years by a person who is of or above the age of 18 years"": s 16B(1)(b)(i). The provisions of s 16A of the Bail Act 2013 apply:
	


“16A Accused person to show cause for certain serious offences

(1) A bail authority [defined in s 4(1) to mean a police officer, an authorised justice or a court] making a bail decision for a show cause offence must refuse bail unless the accused person shows cause why his or her detention is not justified.

(2) If the accused person does show cause why his or her detention is not justified, the bail authority must make a bail decision in accordance with Division 2 (Unacceptable risk test-all offences).

(3) This section does not apply if the accused person was under the age of 18 years at the time of the offence.”


	
	The terms of subs (2) make it clear that there is a two-step process involved in determining bail release and detention applications for show cause offences. That this is so is further confirmed by a flow chart in s 16; the provision in s 17(4) that s 17 does not apply if bail is refused under Div 1A; and the provision in s 19(3) that in relation to a show cause offence, the fact that the accused person has shown cause that detention is not justified is not relevant to the determination of whether or not there is an unacceptable risk.
	
	
	If a person charged with an offence of a type listed in s 16B succeeds in showing cause why his or her detention is not justified pursuant to s 16A(1), it is necessary for a bail authority to consider whether there is an ""unacceptable risk"" that the person will fail to appear; commit a serious offence; endanger the safety of victims, individuals or the community; or interfere with witnesses: s 19(2). Bail must be refused if the bail authority is satisfied that there is an unacceptable risk: s 19(1). If there are no unacceptable risks, bail must be granted, with or without conditions; or the person may be released without bail; or bail may be dispensed with: s 20.
	
	
	Before making a bail decision in terms of whether or not there are any unacceptable risks (as defined in s 19(2)), the bail authority must assess any ""bail concerns"" (s 17(1)). Bail concerns are defined in s 17(2) in a similar fashion to the definition of ""unacceptable risk"" in s 19(1): they are concerns that the accused person if released from custody will fail to appear; commit a serious offence; endanger the safety of victims, individuals or the community; or interfere with witnesses.
	
	
	In the assessment of bail concerns, a bail authority is to consider the various matters listed in s 18, and only those matters.
	
	
	Two matters may be noted and emphasised from this overview of the provisions of the Bail Act 2013. First, if the offence in question is a ""show cause"" offence, there is a two-step process: cause must first be shown as to why detention is not justified under Div 1A of Pt 3 and, if it is shown, the bail authority must then consider the ""unacceptable risk"" test in Div 2 of Pt 3. Secondly, there is an exhaustive list of matters in s 18 that must be considered in relation to the latter but the Bail Act 2013 does not prescribe what must or might be considered in relation to the former.
	
	
	The Director drew the Court's attention to the judgment of McCallum J in M v R [2015] NSWSC 138. Her Honour was dealing with a bail release application by a person charged with a number of offences, at least one of which (murder) was a show cause offence. The matter came before her Honour in the Bails List some two weeks after the amendments made by the Bail Amendment Act came into force.
	
	
	Her Honour noted the various provisions within Div 1A and Div 2 of Pt 3 of the Act, observing (at [7]-[8]) that the ""apparent simplicity of a two-stage approach is illusory"" and that ""it is difficult to conceive how an applicant could show cause without addressing any relevant bail concerns"". She continued (at [8]):
	


""The issue whether an applicant has shown cause in my view must inevitably be informed by the outcome of the risk assessment, since the Act contemplates that the detention of a person who poses an unacceptable risk of the kind identified is justified. Conversely, it is difficult to conceive of a finding that an applicant had failed to show cause in circumstances where there was no unacceptable risk. The absence of any unacceptable risk would, I think, inevitably point to the conclusion that the detention was not justified, bearing in mind the common law principles to which I have referred.""


	
	McCallum J acknowledged that s 16A must be construed as having some work to do. She explained:
	


“[13] … In my view, the section should be understood to have the object of instructing the bail authority that, in the case of a show cause requirement, the circumstance that triggered the requirement is likely to inform the assessment of any bail concerns and the evaluative judgment as to the acceptability of any risk established. In some instances, the circumstance giving rise to the show cause requirement is in itself likely to reveal a bail concern. For example, s 16B(1)(d) specifies, as show cause offences, a series of offences relating to firearms, pistols, prohibited weapons and the like. Similarly, s 16B(1)(f) specifies as show cause offences offences under the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW) involving the cultivation, supply, possession, manufacture or production of a commercial quantity of a prohibited drug.

[14] The Act guides the court that it must have regard to the common or notorious features of such offences. For example, a strong Crown case as to the commission of an indictable offence involving the unlawful possession of a pistol in a public place would guide the Court in the assessment of a bail concern as to the safety of the community. Similarly, a strong Crown case alleging an offence under the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act of the kind to which I have referred would guide the Court as to the likelihood of an applicant re-offending, the insidiousness of an addiction to some prohibited drugs, such as Ice, being a matter of notoriety.

[15] Importantly, I would construe s 16A as imposing on an applicant the task of persuading the Court that any such obvious bail concern did not give rise to an unacceptable risk of the kind specified in the Act. In saying so, I do not mean to suggest that the Act imposes any formal onus of proof in the traditional sense. The Act makes it clear in s 32 that any matter that must be decided by the bail authority in exercising a function in relation to bail is to be decided on the balance of probabilities, but the rules of evidence do not apply in that task. Rather, the bail authority may take into account any evidence or information it considers credible or trustworthy in the circumstances: see s 31 of the Act.

[16] But the Court should not approach the show cause requirement, in my view, on the ground that an applicant must go further in order to show cause why his or her detention is not justified or bears any higher onus than to persuade the Court that there is no unacceptable risk having regard to the bail conditions that could reasonably be imposed to address any bail concerns in accordance with s 20A.”


	
	We accept that in many cases it may well be that matters that are relevant to the unacceptable risk test will also be relevant to the show cause test and that, if there is nothing else that appears to the bail authority to be relevant to either test, the consideration of the show cause requirement will, if resolved in favour of the accused person, necessarily resolve the unacceptable risk test in his or her favour as well.
	
	
	It is important, however, that the two tests not be conflated. Determination of the unacceptable risk test is not determinative of the show cause test. The show cause test by its terms requires an accused person to demonstrate why, on the balance of probabilities (s 32), his or her detention is not justified. The justification or otherwise of detention is a matter to be determined by a consideration of all of the evidence or information the bail authority considers credible or trustworthy in the circumstances (s 31(1)) and not just by a consideration of those matters exhaustively listed in s 18 required to be considered for the unacceptable risk assessment.
	
	
	The present case provides an example of why it is important to bear in mind the two-stage approach Parliament has prescribed in relation to bail applications concerned with offences of the type listed in s 16B in that here there is a matter that is relevant to the show cause test that is not available to be considered in relation to the unacceptable risk test. The jury's verdict of guilty is not within any of the matters listed in s 18; yet it is plainly germane to the question whether cause can be shown that his continuing detention is unjustified, since the presumption of innocence, which operated in his favour before the jury returned its verdict, has been rebutted by that verdict.
	
	
	The Director also made relatively brief submissions as to the content of the show cause test in Div 1A. He cited a single authority, a decision of a magistrate in Queensland: Landsowne v Director of Public Prosecutions (Qld) [2013] QMC 19. A number of other interstate authorities are available in which there is discussion of a show cause test in bail legislation in those jurisdictions. However, in the absence of full argument on the issue it would be appropriate to defer more detailed analysis which is now more likely to occur in the Court of Criminal Appeal.
	


Reasons for determination to refuse bail


	
	The Court was not involved in reviewing the decision of King DCJ but rather with considering the Crown's detention application afresh. The following matters were relevant.
	
	
	The respondent was found guilty by a jury on 27 February 2015 of a very serious offence carrying a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 25 years and a standard non-parole period of 15 years. King DCJ adjourned the matter for a sentence hearing on 10 April 2015.
	
	
	According to the indictment the offence occurred between 1 June and 19 December 2013 when the victim was aged either 4 or 5. It occurred in circumstances where she was at a home-based day care centre operated by the respondent's wife. The allegation which the jury found proved beyond reasonable doubt was that the respondent digitally penetrated the little girl's vagina whilst they were alone in the lounge room. According to the statement of facts tendered to this Court, the victim pleaded with the respondent a number of times not to do it and it caused her immediate pain before she pushed him away.
	
	
	The respondent was arrested and charged on 24 December 2013. He was refused bail by police but granted bail in the Local Court the following day. It was a condition of his bail that he not approach the victim, or any other child in care at the day care centre, or anyone with whom such children lived. The respondent breached that condition less than a fortnight later when he and his wife made contact and attended the home of a parent of another child. He was arrested the following day for breach of bail but was again released on conditional bail by the Local Court the following day. The respondent claimed that he had misunderstood his bail conditions.
	
	
	The Court was not provided with a transcript of the bail release application that was made to King DCJ, or a transcript of his Honour's reasons. We were informed by Mr Brasch of counsel, who appeared in the District Court, that bail was granted in order to allow the respondent to ""get his affairs in order"". The Court was informed that his Honour made it clear that the sentence that would be imposed would be one of full-time imprisonment and that bail would be refused if the matter was not able to be finalised on 10 April.
	
	
	Mr Brasch informed us that he had submitted to King DCJ that, notwithstanding the sentence that would be imposed, there were a number of reasons why the respondent should have his liberty in the meantime: the respondent was a married man, aged almost 60, who had not previously been imprisoned and he had financial and employment related matters to attend to. An additional reason was that a psychological report was to be sought for the sentence proceedings and being at liberty would facilitate the respondent's attendance upon the psychologist.
	
	
	By the time of the hearing in this Court, the respondent had been at liberty since the jury's verdict for some four weeks. Counsel advanced the following reasons why the Crown's detention application should be refused: the respondent had complied with strict conditions of bail for a significant period of time prior to trial and since; he remained in employment and was hoping to continue working for as long as possible so as to provide for his wife before giving two weeks' notice to his employer; there were matters relating to his superannuation that he needed to attend to; he had a scheduled medical test the following week in relation to his kidneys; and there was only about two weeks remaining until the sentence hearing.
	
	
	We were not persuaded that these matters were sufficient to show cause why the respondent's detention was not justified in circumstances where he has been found guilty of a most serious offence and concedes that he will receive a full-time custodial sentence. The matters relied upon are not out of the ordinary for a person found guilty at trial and facing inevitable incarceration upon sentence. There was no evidence concerning the medical test the respondent was due to undergo the following week and it was not suggested that he had a condition for which Justice Health would be unable to provide appropriate care and treatment (if any is required). In response to a question from the bench, counsel indicated that the respondent would not suffer any financial penalty in relation to giving notice to his employer or in relation to his superannuation.
	
	
	It was upon the respondent's failure to show cause why his detention was not justified that the Crown's detention application was granted and bail was refused.

2703697,Feili v R [2015] NSWCCA 43,"Judgment


	
	THE COURT: The Appellant, Taleb Feili, appeals against his conviction on 17 April 2013 for an offence of riot under s.93B Crimes Act 1900 following a trial before RA Hulme J and a jury in the Supreme Court of New South Wales.
	
	
	The Appellant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of one year and 10 months commencing on 10 August 2012 and expiring on 9 June 2014, with a balance of term of one year and two months commencing on 10 June 2014 and expiring on 9 August 2015. The sentencing Judge directed that the Appellant be released on parole upon the expiration of the non-parole period on 9 June 2014.
	
	
	The appeal to this Court challenges the Appellant’s conviction. No ground of appeal is directed to sentence.
	


Grounds of Appeal


	
	The grounds of appeal relate to an issue which arose during the trial concerning the fitness of the Appellant to be tried. The Appellant relies upon the following grounds of appeal:
	



	
	Ground 1 - the learned trial Judge erred in finding the Appellant was fit to be tried, or in the alternative;
	
	
	Ground 2 - the learned trial Judge erred in failing to take into account a relevant consideration, namely the fact that the Appellant had been asleep and unable to participate in his trial for a period of up to nine weeks before his medication had responded reasonably; or
	
	
	Ground 3 - the learned trial Judge erred in taking an irrelevant consideration into account, namely that ameliorative measures could be put into place to manage the symptoms of sleeplessness for the duration of the trial after the Appellant had been asleep throughout the first five weeks of his trial and this was causally related to his mental condition.
	



	
	As will be seen, substantial issue was taken by the Crown with respect to factual matters asserted as parts of Grounds 2 and 3.
	


Factual Background


	
	For the purpose of determining the present appeal, brief reference only is required to the factual matters giving rise to the trial of the Appellant.
	
	
	The Appellant stood trial with a number of other persons for alleged offences committed at the Villawood Immigration Detention Centre on 20 April 2011. All of the accused persons were detainees at the Centre as at 20 April 2011. Charges against the various accused persons alleged riot contrary to s.93B Crimes Act 1900 and affray contrary to s.93C of that Act.
	
	
	After almost two weeks of pretrial hearings, the trial itself commenced with the empanelment of a jury on 11 February 2013. The jury retired on 11 April 2013 and returned with their verdicts on 17 April 2013. The Appellant was convicted of riot, and it was not necessary for the jury to consider a verdict on the alternative count of affray.
	
	
	On 28 June 2013, RA Hulme J sentenced each of the five persons convicted by the jury, including the Appellant: R v Ali; R v Amiri; R v Feili; R v Haidari; R v Parhizkar [2013] NSWSC 871.
	
	
	The nature of the offence for which the Appellant was convicted may be gleaned from the remarks on sentence at [13]-[20]:
	


“13   Mr Feili was not one of the detainees who went up onto the roof of the Macquarie Building but he was one of the most active of the participants in the riot on the ground. In the early evening, he approached one Serco officer, clicking his fingers and threatening her with his arms in the air. He was ranting and swearing in English and in his native tongue. He was heard to say, ‘You can help this stop. You can stop this now’. He came quite close to the officer and grabbed at her. She said, understandably, that she felt ‘very frightened, very scared’ (T295-296).

14   It was submitted on Mr Feili's behalf that he was trying to assist Serco officers by drawing their attention to an apparent suicide attempt being made by one of the detainees on the roof. If that was so, it remains the case that the manner in which he did so was perceived as being more provocative than helpful.

15   Sometime later, Mr Feili approached a male officer and said, in what was described as a loud and forceful manner, ‘I need to speak to someone high up from Immigration now and if you do that I can stop this now’ (T514-515). At another time he approached another female officer and told her that he could ‘stop it’ (T861).

16   Mr Feili was one of the oldest of the detainees in the compound and these activities suggest that he was a person of some influence. However, he did nothing to try and prevent the subsequent violence; in fact, he played a significant role which encouraged its escalation.

17   Mr Feili took up fire extinguishers and discharged them before throwing them in the direction of Serco staff. He involved himself in the movement of wheelie bins and a timber table and chairs to the fire on the soccer field. He was also involved in the dismantling of soccer goal posts and was seen to throw one part in a spear-like action towards staff. Finally, just before the staff evacuation, Mr Feili held a fire extinguisher above his head and threw it through a window of the office behind which the staff were cowering.

18   It was submitted for Mr Feili that the evidence does not enable a conclusion that he was aware that someone intended to set the office alight. I accept that. But what he did facilitated the continuance and escalation of the destructive conduct that was going on around him.

19   The Crown submitted that Mr Feili was involved in numerous acts of violence towards both people and property; he encouraged others, at least implicitly, to become involved; and he was directly threatening to staff. The evidence in the trial clearly supports those propositions. It also supports the submission that ‘he was central to the violent activities on the ground’. 

20   It was submitted for Mr Feili that he had consumed alcohol and that ‘his judgment and inhibitions may have been clouded by that factor’. The evidence on this issue was not entirely persuasive but I am prepared to accept on balance that he probably was. The relevance of this is not to reduce his moral culpability but it does support a finding that his actions were out of character. Such a finding does not distinguish his case from any of the other offenders; all of them did things that were not typical of their normal behaviour.”


	
	His Honour addressed the seriousness of the Appellant’s offence at [32]:
	


“Of those of the offenders to be sentenced for riot, I assess the offences of Feili and Parhizkar as being the most serious because of the significant roles they played in perpetrating violent acts and in influencing the involvement of other detainees.”

An Issue of Fitness Arises at Trial Concerning the Appellant


	
	Pretrial proceedings commenced with respect to 12 accused persons, including the Appellant, on 29 January 2013 and the trial commenced before a jury on 11 February 2013.
	
	
	On 7 March 2013, counsel for the Appellant raised a question as to the fitness of his client to be tried. The basis upon which it was thought that the Appellant was not fit to be tried was, in the words of the trial Judge, “quite unusual; he is sleeping at times during the trial”: R v Feili [2013] NSWSC 492 at [3].
	
	
	In accordance with s.10 Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990, the trial Judge being satisfied that the question of fitness had been raised in good faith after arraignment, his Honour proceeded to conduct an inquiry to determine whether the Appellant was unfit to be tried. The jury was sent away whilst that inquiry proceeded.
	
	
	Dr Stephen Allnutt, forensic psychiatrist, was called on 7 March 2013 to give evidence at the fitness inquiry on the Appellant’s behalf. He had seen the Appellant on 22 January 2013 and had diagnosed him as suffering from depression. He saw him again on 11 February 2013 and assessed him as being fit to be tried. However, when he saw the Appellant again on 28 February 2013, he came to the view that “on balance the reasonable position … to take is that he is probably unfit to stand trial” (T1051.22).
	
	
	The Crown engaged Dr Bruce Westmore, forensic psychiatrist, to see the Appellant at the Villawood Immigration Detention Centre on 9 March 2013 and a report dated 11 March 2013 was prepared by Dr Westmore. Dr Westmore concluded that the Appellant was fit to be tried and gave evidence to that effect at the fitness inquiry on 11 March 2013.
	
	
	Dr Allnutt was recalled to give further evidence on 12 March 2013 having had an opportunity to consider the report and evidence of Dr Westmore.
	
	
	On 12 March 2013, the trial Judge found the Appellant fit to be tried with reasons for that conclusion to be given at a later time (T2087.3).
	
	
	On 13 March 2013, his Honour gave reasons for the finding that the Appellant was fit to be tried: R v Feili.
	
	
	The trial of the Appellant and others continued after the finding of fitness, with the jury returning verdicts on 17 April 2013.
	


The Judgment Concerning the Appellant’s Fitness to be Tried


	
	Before moving to the grounds of appeal, it is appropriate to refer in some detail to his Honour’s judgment of 13 March 2013 on the fitness issue.
	
	
	The trial Judge referred to pertinent parts of the evidence of Dr Allnutt and Dr Westmore: R v Feili at [6]-[20].
	
	
	His Honour set out at [6] evidence from Dr Allnutt which included the following extract:
	


“I would formulate that the context that he is in at the moment has been acting as a significant stressor for him. What he's complaining of are three problems: insomnia, concentration difficulties and fatigue and motivation problems which probably go together. Insomnia, difficulties with concentration, fatigue are common symptoms of depression. He is, I think - he has, I think, found the hearings to be stressful and upsetting emotionally and what happens is when he returns back to Villawood for the night he becomes preoccupied and ruminative of the hearings. He's vulnerable to that due to his depression. As a consequence of his ruminations and anxieties he doesn't sleep and he's vulnerable to not sleeping purely because he has depression in the first place, so insomnia is a symptom of depression, so he becomes ruminative, unable to sleep at night, wakes up in the morning unrested, fatigued and, in the context of the hearing, he's unable to maintain his focus and concentration and so falls asleep. So essentially he's not following proceedings as a consequence.

To some degree one might say that there is an element of voluntariness to it. It's upsetting for him and he sometimes doesn't want to focus and be there, and in the absence of depression, one might draw that conclusion, but I think given that he's got a depressive disorder, and is experiencing symptoms of depression, that makes - provides an involuntary component to the problem. And on balance I think it would be reasonable to conclude on that basis that he's unfit to stand trial because of his depression and because he cannot follow proceedings. That then impacts on the quality of his interaction with his counsel.

There's a further problem that has been communicated to me by his counsel that he seems not to remember from day to day what was discussed the day before. That's not an uncommon complaint in people who have significant depression because one of the symptoms of depression is concentration problems.

So on balance I think the reasonable conclusion is he's unfit to stand trial basically because he fails on the issue outlined in Kesavarajah rather than Presser. 

Q. Doctor, there has been a change from the time that you saw him on 11 February to today's date as outlined by you, correct? In the sense that he was assessed by you at one stage to be fit for trial and now unfit for trial? 

A. Yes. He described to me that he feels he's deteriorated as the trial has continued. At the time that I saw him, I suppose there was no clear - I mean, while he had complained of concentration problems and he did have insomnia, many people come before the Court with depression because they are in front of the Court often and are still fit. So at that stage, in a sense, his capacity to follow proceedings appeared to be adequate. It's in the context of the trial that it's been tested and it doesn't seem to be the case. 

Q. That was the point I was moving to. The trial itself has caused more symptoms which have led you to conclude that he is now unfit for trial? 

A. Yes. I think it's fair to say that the trial is a stress for him and aggravates symptoms for him. (T1051.25-1052.33)”


	
	The trial Judge referred to further evidence of Dr Allnutt at [9]:
	


“Dr Allnutt was asked whether it was possible that Mr Feili was feigning his symptoms. The evidence on this aspect included the following:

Q. So as to whether he is asleep or not is a matter of fact that has to be determined? 

A. Correct. 

Q. If he's feigning or not being completely honest as to what is happening during the course of the trial during the day-to-day proceedings, that would change your opinion? 

A. Yes. Well, if he's not, in fact, sleeping, that would, I suppose, diminish the likelihood. 

Q. That he's unfit? 

A. That he's unfit because it predominantly rests on him not following proceedings. There are other aspects that may be impacting which is poor concentration, but if he is, in fact, feigning sleep then that does, I suppose, jade that argument. (T1062.45-1063.3)”


	
	His Honour turned to the evidence of Dr Westmore at [12]-[14]:
	


“12   Dr Westmore took a relatively lengthy history from Mr Feili and made a provisional diagnosis that he was suffering from a chronic Adjustment Disorder with depressed mood. A differential diagnosis would include Dysthymic Disorder or a Major Depressive Disorder. 

13   Dr Westmore's ultimate conclusion was that ‘Mr Feili is fit to be tried if he can remain awake’. His report includes the following:

Despite his depression, I did not think he was cognitively impaired in any significant way (because of his depression) which might compromise his fitness. He does not have evidence of an organic disturbance and he is not psychotic. His history is that he is chronically tired and has major problems sleeping. While psychiatrists have no expertise in truthfulness, I think his overall affect and demeanour were consistent with the history he gave in relation to his state of tiredness. He was not a dramatic or histrionic historian, more fatigued, reserved and a little withdrawn.

He could however indicate quite clearly and consistently that he did want the legal matters to proceed to their conclusion.

Mr Feili is likely to be falling asleep in court in part because he is tired, but also because he is disinterested in the outcome, or at least he has been to date. His position is that nothing much else can be done to him now. His application to remain in Australia has been rejected, he is uncertain about the welfare of his family and he has had 2 heart attacks and he is worried about possibly having a 3rd heart attack.

His sleep hygiene appears to be problematic, but that might be corrected with appropriate medical management. In the court setting he might be assisted by having an individual interpreter whose job would be not only to ensure that he understands what is said and what is happening in court, but also to ensure that he remains awake. The court may also be able to make some allowances for Mr Feili by giving him some regular breaks during the proceedings.

14   Dr Westmore's account of his conversation with Mr Feili included that he asked, ‘what must I do?’ Dr Westmore told him that he would need to stay awake in court and that if he continued to experience such problems the process might be even more protracted than it currently was. Mr Feili indicated that he understood and said, ‘Yes, I will do my best to be awake in court’. He also said that he wanted the case to be finalised.”


	
	The Court then addressed the evidence of Dr Allnutt given after Dr Westmore had testified. In the course of this, his Honour said at [20]:
	


“The following evidence given at the conclusion of Dr Allnutt's further evidence is of importance:

Q. Doctor, can I just clarify something with you. Going back to Presser and Kesavarajah I want to be absolutely clear what is the basis for your opinion that he is unfit. Is it because he does not have the capacity to follow the course of the proceedings so as to understand what is going on in court in a general sense and/or he doesn't have the ability to understand the substantial effect of any evidence that may be given against him? They are two Presser criteria that seem to be what you are concerned with but I would like to hear it from you? 

A. I think yes, I think it goes to those two. I think - look, it depends on what the thresholds are here and that again sometimes varies from court to court. People apply different thresholds depending on the duration of the trial, depending on the nature of the evidence that's required. So that's got to be taken into consideration as well. 

I suppose how important, and an issue has been brought up about that, how important it is that he hears all the evidence, but in particular the evidence that pertains to him; that he actually hears and takes in what each witness is saying about him in particular, whether that is happening. 

Q. But he is not doing that in a direct sense? 

A. If he's not doing that then-- 

Q. If that man reading off a computer screen in the dock is not there he wouldn't have a clue what was being said. He wouldn't be able to follow the evidence at all. So we take the step of providing an interpreter so that the evidence can be relayed to him. He is getting it secondhand though. Similarly, if my understanding of the law is correct, Presser does not require an accused to be able to hear first-hand and understand every single word that is uttered in a criminal trial but they have to have an ability to generally follow the course of the proceedings and generally to understand the substantial effect of the evidence. Now, given there is one example of him not hearing any of the evidence first-hand is another example that might be considered, the fact that he can have any of the evidence that he has missed himself repeated to him. We have a daily transcript, we have lawyers keeping notes; if his lawyers, in conference, become aware that he has missed something they can tell him exactly what was said. So he does have that ability, second-hand albeit, to be able to follow the evidence and to understand the substantial effect of it. 

A. Yes, I would accept that. 

Q. So if that is borne in mind he must be found to be fit, mustn't he? 

A. If that's the test then he must be found to be fit as long as he - as long as - yes, if he can take the information in afterwards in a meeting with his counsel then - and the test is a general understanding of proceedings and, as I say, that has - that varies, but if that's the test then on balance he probably would be regarded as fit if in meeting with his counsel afterwards he is able to take that information in and communicate with his counsel in relation to that during that meeting. 

The issue though is there may be evidence that is provided that is crucial that may be, for him, has special importance and he may miss it, but that's another side of the spectrum. It depends where - again it is a threshold - it depends on how broad - where one draws the line upon that spectrum. 

Q. The question is not so much whether he has a reduced capacity to follow the course of the proceedings to understand what's going on in court in a general sense and understands the substantial effect of the evidence. A reduced capacity doesn't mean a person is unfit. It is a question of whether the person is denied that capacity and the authority for that is The Queen v Rivkin, a 2004 case. So it is a question here as to whether he is denied the capacity and, bearing in mind steps that can be taken for him to be acquainted with the evidence with the assistance of his lawyers, I wonder whether it truly can be said that he is denied those capacities? 

A. If he could be provided with that information by the lawyers and not miss crucial information and that - and he takes that information in from his lawyers, then I suppose, on balance, it would meet that test.”


	
	His Honour then made a number of significant findings at [21]-[27]:
	


“21    It has been my observation at various stages of the trial that Mr Feili has appeared to be asleep. Up until Mr Flynn raised his concerns last Thursday, I simply assumed that this was out of boredom or disinterest. 

22   I accept that there is a possibility that Mr Feili has been falling asleep as a result of fatigue, or being chronically tired as a result of not getting sufficient sleep at night. Dr Allnutt spoke of insomnia being a result of the depressive disorder from which Mr Feili suffers. Dr Westmore does not appear to take issue with that. I accept that evidence.

23   I accept also that a contributing cause may well be that Mr Feili is either bored or disinterested, or, as Dr Allnutt put it, he finds it ‘upsetting to him and he sometimes doesn't want to focus and be there’ (T1051.50). For a lot of the time during the trial there are matters being discussed that do not have any direct relevance to Mr Feili, aside from the issue as to whether there was a common purpose of those involved in the disturbance at the Villawood Immigration Detention Centre that is the subject of the charges. There is nothing before me that would indicate he has been asleep when matters of importance to his case were the subject matter. Even if that was the case, there is nothing to indicate that it has not been possible for Mr Feili to be kept apprised by his lawyers of what has been said of relevance to him. The court reporters are providing both a real-time and daily transcript service. No attempt was made to place any evidence before me to the effect that Mr Feili has missed something that is ‘crucial’ to the case against him, or to his defence.

24   Dr Westmore spoke of a number of steps that could be taken to overcome the consequential problem of Mr Feili falling asleep in court. Having somebody sitting in the dock monitoring him and attracting his attention if he looked drowsy was one. Having his general sleeping arrangements, or ‘sleep hygiene’ as Dr Westmore called it, reviewed was another. Further, consideration by a general practitioner to prescribing appropriate medication might assist. It seemed from what the Crown Prosecutor told me just before the further evidence of Dr Allnutt on Tuesday 12 March 2013 that some steps have been taken. Whether they will have any ameliorative effect remains to be seen.

25   According to Dr Westmore, Mr Feili is motivated to see the trial proceed to conclusion. Neither doctor saw anything that would give rise to concern that he was not genuine in this respect. 

26   Both Dr Allnutt and Dr Westmore are of the view that if Mr Feili is sleeping through periods of the trial then he is unfit to be tried. The converse, obviously, is that if he is not sleeping through periods of the trial he is not unfit. If Mr Feili makes a concerted effort to stay awake, perhaps aided by the various measures alluded to above, and is successful, then a conclusion that he is unfit is not justified.

27   I must say, however, that I am not entirely convinced that a person can be unfit to be tried on account of the person sleeping at times during their trial.”


	
	His Honour then turned, at [28]-[31], to consider, in the practical context of this case, the relevant principles concerning fitness to be tried, including R v Presser [1958] VR 45; Kesavarajah v The Queen [1994] HCA 41; 181 CLR 230; R v Rivkin [2004] NSWCCA 7; 59 NSWLR 284 and Clarkson v R [2007] NSWCCA 70; 171 A Crim R 1:
	


“28   Fitness to be tried is assessed by application of the criteria referred to by Smith J in R v Presser [1958] VR 45 at 48. Dr Allnutt said in the passage from his evidence extracted above (at [6]) that Mr Feili was ‘unfit to stand trial ... because he fails on the issue outlined in Kesavarajah rather than Presser’. This view was not fully developed in submissions or evidence. But I understand it to be a reference to considering fitness in the light of the expected duration of the trial, especially where the issue is manifested in a psychiatric condition that may become more florid in response to the stressors of the proceeding. I am satisfied that, unless it proves otherwise, the ameliorative measures outlined at [24] are an appropriate response to managing the symptoms of sleeplessness for the duration of the trial.

29   There is no specific reference in the Presser criteria (nor in Kesavarajah v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 230 for that matter) to being able to stay awake and listen to every single word uttered during the entirety of the trial. The closest any of the Presser criteria comes to being relevant to the present situation, at 48, is:

He needs to be able to follow the course of the proceedings so as to understand what is going on in court in a general sense, though he need not, of course, understand the purpose of all of the various court formalities. He needs to be able to understand ... the substantial effect of any evidence that may be given against him ...

30   Dr Allnutt confirmed that these were the aspects that gave rise to his opinion as to unfitness (see above at [20]).

31   In Clarkson v R [2007] NSWCCA 70, Beazley JA (as her Honour then was) reviewed extensively the law relating to the issue of an accused being fit or unfit to be tried. Whilst it was accepted that the Presser criteria has long been the understanding in the common law of the measures by which fitness to be tried was to be assessed, her Honour's review of authority included the following statements of the general concept:

[130]    In Ngatayi v The Queen (1980) 147 CLR 1 Gibbs, Mason and Wilson JJ observed that legislation governing ‘fitness to be tried’ had always been interpreted as to raise the question ‘whether the prisoner has sufficient understanding to comprehend the nature of this trial, so as to make a proper defence to the charge’: see R v Pritchard (1836) 173 ER 135 per Alderson B.

...

[132]    Their Honours, at 8, said that the test ‘looks to the capacity of the accused to understand the proceedings’, but pointed out that complete understanding was not necessary. Their Honours agreed with the approach taken by Smith J in Presser that the test needs to be applied ‘in a reasonable and commonsense fashion’. Their Honours essentially endorsed the statement of Smith J as to the minimum capacity an accused needed before he could be tried without unfairness or injustice. ... At 9, their Honours reiterated the test to be applied, namely, whether the accused person ‘is capable of understanding the proceedings at the trial so as to be able to make a proper defence’.

[133]    The High Court again dealt with the question of fitness to be tried in Kesavarajah v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 230. ... Again, the Court accepted the test to be applied was one that ‘looks to the capacity of the accused to understand the proceedings’. ...

[134]    In Eastman v the Queen (2000) 203 CLR 1; [2000] HCA 29 ... Gaudron J said at [57] that in general terms, a person was fit to plead if that person ‘has sufficient understanding to comprehend the nature of [the trial] so as to make a proper defence to the charge’. ...

...

[142]    In R v Rivkin (2004) 59 NSWLR 284; [2004] NSWCCA 7, the Court (Mason P, Wood CJ at CL and Sully J) held at [279] that the question of fitness to be tried was to be determined by application of the Presser test:

‘The test for determining fitness to stand trial is whether the accused has a sufficient mental state, and intellect, to comprehend the course of the proceedings involved in the trial, so as to follow those proceedings, and so as to make a proper defence. The factors to be taken account have been accepted as being those developed in R v Presser (supra), an authority which has been consistently followed in this State and elsewhere: see for example R v Mailes, R v Zhang [2000] NSWCCA 344, R v Tier (2001) 121 A Crim R 509, and Kesavarajah v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 230.’

[143]    In Rivkin, the question of unfitness to be tried arose after conviction when it was established that the appellant had a brain tumour which would have caused frontal lobe dysfunction. Again, the Court referred in some detail to the authorities discussed above, which were adopted as correctly stating the law. The additional consideration in Rivkin was the test to be applied where the question of fitness to be tried is raised after conviction. That is not an issue here. However, their Honours were also considering a question that is relevant here, namely, where a person has a ‘temporary condition’. In that regard, their Honours said at [296]-[298]:

‘So far as the present case involves a temporary condition, which was amenable to treatment, and which has since been reversed, so that no current question of fitness arises, it does differ from most, if not all, of the other cases which have attracted an application of the requirements in R v Presser.

The central question which arises, in this respect, is whether a reduction in the capacity of an accused to meet the requirements in R v Presser, but which falls short of denying to that accused the capacity to understand and to follow the proceedings in each of the necessary aspects, is sufficient to constitute unfitness, and to justify appellate intervention, in accordance with the test previously mentioned.

... The test in R v Presser is directed to the minimum requirements for a fair trial. So long as the accused can understand and follow the proceedings in each of its facets, can give appropriate instructions, and can present a proper defence to the charge, he or she is to be regarded as fit to be tried. The fact that the accused may have done so in a better way, had suitable medical treatment or medication been provided, or had that accused possessed greater intelligence or acuity of mind, does not seem to us to be relevant to the question of fitness.’

[144]    The Court concluded at [301] that the question of fitness to be tried related to the ‘essential requirements’ as stated in Presser.”


	
	The trial Judge made a further important finding at [32]:
	


“I am satisfied that Mr Feili is ‘capable of understanding the proceedings at the trial so as to be able to make a proper defence’. It has not been suggested that he does not have the mental capacity to understand sufficiently what is going on in court, or to understand the substantial effect of any evidence given against him. If he happens to miss any aspect of the evidence that is relevant to him, it must be within the capacity of his lawyers, armed with whatever notes they are taking of the evidence and also with a daily transcript, to inform him of it. Even if it is correct to conclude that Mr Feili has a reduced capacity to meet the Presser criteria, particularly those mentioned above, that does not mean that he is unfit to be tried; he will only be unfit if he is denied that capacity: R v Rivkin [2004] NSWCCA 7; (2004) 59 NSWLR 284 at [297]-[301] per Mason P, Wood CJ at CL and Sully J.”


	
	His Honour concluded the judgment in the following way at [33]-[34]:
	


“33   I accept that Mr Feili may well have a reduced capacity to meet two of the criteria in Presser for being regarded as fit to be tried but I was not persuaded that he is completely denied that capacity. There are steps available to substantially overcome any shortfall in relation to those matters.

34   The accused Taleb Feili is fit to be tried.”

The Grounds of Appeal


	
	It is convenient to consider the three grounds of appeal together. The first ground of appeal seeks to challenge the ultimate finding that the Appellant was fit to be tried, whilst the second and third grounds assert, in the alternative to the first ground, errors on the way to the ultimate finding.
	


Submissions of the Appellant


	
	It was submitted for the Appellant that a miscarriage of justice had occurred by reason of the trial Judge’s findings and conclusion on the fitness inquiry. It was submitted that the Appellant had missed a period of up to seven weeks of his trial. Emphasis was placed upon the evidence of Dr Allnutt.
	
	
	Counsel submitted that there was objective evidence of the Appellant’s illness and that his ability to participate in his trial and to instruct counsel as to his evidence was impeded. It was asserted that the Appellant had missed his opportunity to participate in some five weeks of the trial. Rather than dealing with this situation, it was submitted that the trial Judge turned his mind to steps which could be taken to overcome the problem of the Appellant falling asleep in court. Counsel submitted that this was the wrong question to be asked.
	
	
	Reference was made to decisions of courts in Australia and the United Kingdom concerning the importance of an accused person following proceedings during a criminal trial: R v Lee Kun [1916] 1 KB 337; Kunnath v The State [1993] 4 All ER 30 and Ebataringa and Anor v Deland and Ors [1998] HCA 62; 194 CLR 444.
	
	
	It was submitted for the Appellant that the trial Judge had erred in finding the Appellant was fit to be tried on the evidence before him. It was submitted further that the trial did not conform with contemporary standards in New South Wales and comparable standards in other Australian jurisdictions.
	


Submissions for the Crown


	
	The Crown submitted that the conclusion reached by the trial Judge was open on the evidence and that no error had been demonstrated in accordance with the principles in House v The King [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499.
	
	
	With respect to the matters contained in the second and third grounds, the Crown submitted that there was no evidence to support the assertions made regarding the period of time that the Appellant had been asleep. In any event, the Crown submitted that there was no evidence that during the periods that the Appellant might have been asleep, he was deprived of a capacity to participate in his trial.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the trial Judge had applied relevant principles and had reached a conclusion that was open on the evidence. Further, it was submitted that an examination of the record of the trial as a whole did not disclose any impediment to the conduct of the trial on behalf of the Appellant.
	
	
	It was submitted for the Crown that no further application was made by counsel for the Appellant nor was any concern expressed during the balance of the trial. The Crown noted that it was not asserted in this appeal, nor before the trial Judge, that any part of the Appellant’s case was not properly put in accordance with his instructions. Nor was it asserted that the Appellant was denied any opportunity to challenge any “crucial” evidence that he had “missed” either before or after the fitness inquiry.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that there had been no failure to comply with relevant principles and that the Appellant had received a fair trial.
	


Determination


	
	Some undisputed features of the trial should be noted before moving to determine the grounds of appeal.
	
	
	Firstly, counsel for the Appellant had cross-examined a number of witnesses who gave evidence at the trial up to 7 March 2013 when the issue as to fitness was raised. No application was made on behalf of the Appellant that any witness should be recalled for further cross-examination because of any suggested difficulty arising from the Appellant’s condition prior to 7 March 2013.
	
	
	Secondly, the trial proceeded on and after 12 March 2013, and no issue was raised with the trial Judge asserting difficulties experienced by the Appellant or his legal representatives in the conduct of the trial.
	
	
	Thirdly, counsel for the Appellant addressed the jury and the trial Judge summed up in a manner which identified the case of each accused person, including the Appellant.
	
	
	The issue of fitness having arisen during the trial, the trial Judge complied with the requirements of ss.9-11 Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990. The inquiry was conducted in accordance with s.12 of that Act.
	
	
	The question of the Appellant’s unfitness to be tried was determined on the balance of probabilities: s.6 Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990. The determination on the question of fitness included the principles of law applied by the Court and the findings of fact on which his Honour relied: s.11(2) Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990.
	
	
	The Appellant having been found fit to be tried, the proceedings brought against him continued in accordance with the appropriate criminal procedures with the trial of the Appellant resuming in the presence of the jury: s.13 Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990.
	
	
	The Appellant having been found fit to be tried on 12 March 2013, it was presumed that he continued to be fit to be tried unless and until the contrary was established on the balance of probabilities: s.15 Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990.
	
	
	The principle underlying an inquiry into fitness is the right of an accused person to a fair trial: R v Presser at 48; Kesavarajah v The Queen at 245.
	
	
	It has been emphasised by courts that the Presser test needs to be applied “in a reasonable and commonsense fashion”: R v Presser at 48; Ngatayi v The Queen [1980] HCA 18; 147 CLR 1 at 8; Kesavarajah v The Queen at 244; Clarkson v R at 26-27 [132]. The trial Judge’s approach in determining the Appellant’s fitness accorded with this approach.
	
	
	Despite an (understandable) reservation that a person can be unfit on account of the person sleeping at times during the trial (R v Feili at [27]), his Honour proceeded to determine the fitness issue on the merits by application of the relevant principles to the facts of the case.
	
	
	In a careful judgment, his Honour made a number of key findings:
	



	
	there was nothing before the Court that would indicate the Appellant had been asleep when matters of importance to his case were the subject matter: R v Feili at [23] (extracted at [27] above);
	
	
	even if that was the case, there was nothing to indicate that it had not been possible for the Appellant to be kept apprised by his lawyers of what had been said of relevance to him, nor had any attempt been made to place evidence before the Court that the Appellant had missed something that was “crucial” to the case against him or his defence: R v Feili at [23] (extracted at [27] above);
	
	
	ameliorative measures were available which constituted an appropriate response to managing the symptoms of sleeplessness for the duration of the trial: R v Feili at [24], [28] (extracted at [27], [28] above);
	
	
	the Appellant was capable of understanding the proceedings so as to be able to make a proper defence - if he happened to miss any aspect of the evidence relevant to him, his lawyers were able to inform him of it: R v Feili at [32] (extracted at [29] above).
	



	
	His Honour’s approach represented a practical, reasonable and commonsense approach to the issues posed at the fitness inquiry. Practical aspects of the trial included the fact that the Appellant required an interpreter and the ability of his legal representatives to assist the Appellant concerning evidence which may affect him.
	
	
	It was for the trial Judge to determine the issue of fitness on the balance of probabilities by application of relevant principles to the evidence adduced at the inquiry. His Honour applied the relevant principles to the evidence and reached a conclusion that was open on the evidence. Although it is sufficient to express this conclusion for the purpose of determining that error in accordance with House v The King at 504-505 is not demonstrated, we record our agreement with the conclusion reached by the trial Judge on the fitness inquiry.
	
	
	We reject the first ground of appeal.
	
	
	The second ground of appeal, expressed in the alternative to the first ground, asserts error in failing to take into account a relevant consideration, namely the fact that the Appellant had been asleep and unable to participate in his trial for a period of up to nine weeks before his medication had responded reasonably.
	
	
	It is sufficient to observe that the factual assertion built into the second ground is not supported by the evidence: see his Honour’s finding in R v Feili at [23] (extracted at [27] above). His Honour had regard to the evidence concerning the Appellant’s sleeping and the psychiatric evidence of Dr Allnutt and Dr Westmore with respect to this question.
	
	
	We reject the second ground of appeal.
	
	
	The third ground of appeal, again expressed to be in the alternative to the first ground, contends that the trial Judge erred in taking into account an irrelevant consideration, namely that ameliorative measures could be put into place to manage the symptoms of sleeplessness for the duration of the trial after the Appellant had been asleep throughout the first five weeks of his trial and this was causally related to his mental condition.
	
	
	The difficulty with this ground, as with Ground 2, is the factual assertion built into the ground which is simply not supported by the evidence. It was appropriate that his Honour have regard to the evidence of Dr Allnutt and Dr Westmore on this issue in determining the question of fitness. It was not demonstrated that the Appellant had been asleep throughout the first five weeks of the trial.
	
	
	Identification of ameliorative measures which could be taken during the balance of the trial involved a practical assessment of the evidence of the two forensic psychiatrists. It was entirely open to the trial Judge to approach this issue on the inquiry in the way in which he did. This was consistent with an approach to fitness “in a reasonable and commonsense fashion” mentioned in the authorities (see [50] above).
	
	
	Moreover, the fact that there was no invitation to revisit any aspect of the evidence prior to 7 March 2013, nor any issue as to fitness raised after 12 March 2013 fortifies a conclusion that the approach adopted by the trial Judge was effective in the circumstances of this case (see [42]-[44] above). As mentioned at [48] above, after the finding of fitness, it was presumed that the Appellant continued to be fit to be tried unless and until the contrary was established on the balance of probabilities. No issue of fitness was raised again after 12 March 2013.
	
	
	We reject the third ground of appeal.
	


Conclusion


	
	The Appellant has not demonstrated factual or legal error with respect to the trial Judge’s finding of fitness to be tried. Nor does the conduct of the trial, both before and after the issue of fitness was determined, indicate any error.
	
	
	The Appellant received a fair trial according to law. No miscarriage of justice has been demonstrated for the purpose of s.6(1) Criminal Appeal Act 1912.
	
	
	The appeal against conviction is dismissed.

2703705,R v Scott (No 3) [2015] NSWSC 460,"EX TEMPORE Judgment


	
	HER HONOUR: In terms of the application to discharge the jury, just I suppose for the record, the considerations that I have, the advanced stage that the trial has reached, it is day 11, all of the most significant evidence has been given. There were quite considerable delays in getting some of the evidence before the Court and at least in part, I apprehend that that is because some of the witnesses were less than willing to come to court and give their evidence in answer to their subpoena. That is one of the features that I take into consideration when having regard to the determination of the application to discharge the jury.
	
	
	The interests of the accused are of course a significant consideration, but it seems to me, particularly since he has the advantage of very experienced counsel coming into the matter to assist him that there is every likelihood can be ready to proceed within a reasonably short and an acceptably short period and that it seems to me is the preferable approach.
	
	
	It is always in the interests of everyone to bring these matters to finalisation as quickly as can reasonably and justly be done, so, on that basis I refuse the application for a discharge of jury.

2703706,R v Heath (No 2) [2015] NSWDC 198,"Judgment


	
	On 5 November 2014 at Newcastle I delivered some remarks about the sentencing of Daniel Heath. I set out the crime that he has pleaded guilty to and some of his background and observations about his progress from Community Corrections and a forensic psychiatrist.
	
	
	At the request of Mr J Fitzgerald of counsel, who appears for Mr Heath, I adjourned the proceedings under s 11 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) for the purposes of assessing Mr Heath’s capacity and prospects for rehabilitation or demonstrating that rehabilitation has taken place. Since then Mr Heath has appeared before me on 18 December 2014 when I received updated reports demonstrating positive progress. I adjourned the matter again to today.
	
	
	Today Mr Fitzgerald tendered further material for his client. It all shows his client in a very good light. His general practitioner describes Daniel Heath as being “highly motivated” and points out that he “has engaged well in treatment with me” as well as with a clinical psychologist. Urinalysis tests are almost all negative. A couple of positive ones are satisfactorily explained in my opinion by exhibit 8, a report from the pathologist. The psychologist, Dr Bonsor, has seen Daniel Heath three times this year and describes him as “a young man who is working hard to make substantial life changes”. He added that Daniel Heath “has attended appointments regularly here and shown what appears to be a sincere desire to remain abstinent.”
	
	
	Mr Fitzgerald made available a list of job applications which his client has made. He secured some employment with a stocktaker and he is hoping to secure a business administration traineeship as well. A registered nurse of some 35 years has provided a very encouraging reference for Daniel Health. The nurse has known him almost all of Daniel Heath’s life and describes him as “trustworthy and responsible” and the nurse, Mr Gary Steele, “would not hesitate to recommend him.” He has also done some training to assist him going into the work place.
	
	
	I described his background and the circumstances for the crime Mr Heath committed in my remarks on 5 November 2014. He committed a serious crime, acknowledging himself the fear which he must have engendered in the victim of his offence. Parliament has fixed a maximum of 20 years imprisonment to the crime that he committed.
	
	
	Considering Daniel Heath’s age and his mental health condition as diagnosed by Dr Bench, as well as the fact that he spent some four months bail refused in custody and has had a period on strict bail conditions, I would regard an appropriate sentence as one of three years imprisonment.
	
	
	However, Mr Heath pleaded guilty at the earliest available opportunity. The courts have a principle that they will encourage such pleas which free up the justice system by giving a discount on sentences where people plead guilty. The discount for a plea entered at the stage that Mr Heath did is 25%. I propose to allow him that discount. I will round it off to eight months so that the sentence that I will impose on Mr Heath will be 22 months imprisonment.
	
	
	Mr Fitzgerald has submitted on behalf of his client that I could suspend that sentence. Ms M Sellathambu who appears for the Director of Public Prosecutions acknowledges that her predecessor had acknowledged the force of that submission.
	
	
	I regard it as an appropriate course because of the outstanding progress which this young man has made in rehabilitating himself. Daniel Heath has come from a very difficult start with his drug use and a car accident and turned his life around. This is a significant accomplishment which the courts respect and acknowledge. It is appropriate that he receive a prison sentence, but that it be suspended.
	


HIS HONOUR:   Stand up, I will sentence you now Daniel Heath.


	
	I convict you of the crime of assault with intent to rob being armed with an offensive weapon under s 97(1) of the Crimes Act 1900. I impose a sentence of 22 months imprisonment for that crime. Under s 12(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 I make an order suspending the execution of the whole of the sentence for the whole of that period and I direct that you be released from custody on condition that you enter into a good behaviour bond for 22 months. The conditions of the bond are these:
	



	
	That you be of good behaviour.
	
	
	That you notify the Registrar of this Court of any change in your residential address.
	
	
	That you attend court if you receive a notice to do so.
	


HIS HONOUR: Are you being supervised by Community Corrections or not?

FITZGERALD: No he is not.

HIS HONOUR: I do not propose any further conditions.

FITZGERALD: No your Honour his parents are taking a keen interest.

HIS HONOUR: I think he has got plenty of support good.

FITZGERALD: His parents have taken a keen interest and he has a program in mind for himself.

HIS HONOUR: I do not think so Miss Sellathambu?

SELLATHAMBU: No your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Daniel Heath I’ve got to explain this to you. You have committed a serious crime. You scared the life out of Ms Feng. You know that, we said that before. You’ve acknowledged it. I’ve given you a prison sentence of 22 months. One year and 10 months is a prison sentence but I have suspended it. So it doesn’t have to be enforced. I’ve taken into account the fact that you’ve spent time in gaol and on strict bail conditions.

A suspended sentence comes with a good behaviour bond. You’ve got to stay out of all sorts of trouble, not even police finding some cannabis in your pocket, which I hope that you’re not using anymore. Nothing like that at all.

If you change where you live you’ve got to let the Registrar of the Court know here by a phone call or a letter or something, email. And if you get a notice to come back to court you’ve got to turn up rather than have the sheriff chasing you or the police.

The most important thing about a bond with a suspended sentence is what Mr Fitzgerald has explained to you. If you breach the bond it’s not like other good behaviour bonds where somebody comes along and says well try again. My hands are tied. I’ve pretty well got to send someone to gaol because I’ve imposed a gaol sentence and if you breach the bond I’ve pretty well got to send you to gaol or give you some kind of custody for a period. So it’s very important that you stay out of trouble for the next 22 months.

I’m confident you will, I can see from the reports that you’ve changed your life around. You’re surrounded by support, getting on with your life. Your mum and your dad are here. They’re all very positive signs, so I have no doubt that I won’t see you again, but it’s important that you understand. Do you understand that?

OFFENDER: Yes your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: And you will need to go to the Downing Centre. Mr Fitzgerald will tell you. Wait around. He has got another case now and he will tell you where you need to go to sign up for the bond and I’m happy for you to go there supervised by your parents, in the company of your parents.
